No, these aren‚Äôt some hidden stories that hitherto have eluded the public narrative, but more as a commentary on present socio-political discourse of the state.   \n \n\nFew things first-\n\n1. A criminal has a finite life cycle. So while it is important to realize the moment to seize opportunity to ride the coattails of power echelons, equally vital is to know when you are beat‚Äîthat is, to understand when your ‚Äòservices‚Äô are no longer useful. Failure to realize this ensure that the cold confines of the morgue is the only destiny of the said criminal, with how many body part remain intact being the only variation. \n\n2. Yes, criminal has a finite life cycle, but not the crime. It will remain till the time power struggle, and in turn humanity, remains. Truth be told, some people are needed to enter the underbelly of the society, just as sanitation workers are needed to clean the sewer beneath the beautiful cozy societies. \n\n3. But these underbelly dealing can often be ugly, to the society that is increasingly been softened by the easy technology fueled lifestyle. After all, the last thing the powers that be need for these dealings going wrong out in the open, resulting in gore, splattered brains and entrails, and thus the PTSDs in masses. So you need intelligent methods of power struggles, dealings and negotiations, bait, buy and sell and what not‚Äîto minimize the sordidity in the open.  As an example, watch this video to understand how these things happen--   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0) \n\n4. Lastly, order is very important for the society to function. Yes, chaos are important at times for the Khadi-Tie (politician-businessman) but in a controlled fashion. To be honest, a lot of drama is controlled, events managed (and sometimes staged) for several reasons. Funnily, even Societies need some Masala to function, as too much ‚Äòstability‚Äô can lead to depression‚ÄîDenmark, Iceland, I am looking at you. De-escalation ramp is managed so that everyone has something to gain. And this holds true for small time politician-mafia-business nexus gone wrong, to larger geopolitical tussle such as the current India-China face off. After all, what is the use if things go uncontrolled to the point of no return? Instability is good for none.  \n\n\n(Contd. in comments)'<br />Author: 'PaKtionablevidence'<br />id: 'hov02s'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'OOOOIHHHHHHHHHH sound effect plays in the background.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'horxac'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH soundtrack plays in background.'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'horvda'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: "Which questions should we choose to answer?

But they believe that it's different religions. \n\nAlso even Tamil Brahmins will not marry a Brahmin from North India, this doesn't mean it's discrimination.\n\n***Reservation is not for to end castes, or discrimination based on them.

First add creamy layer in General category. - *General is not a reserved category, and there's EWS reservation*\n\n2. I support creamy layer in SC/ST from all the categories, some reserved category candidates shared there own experiences.\n\n3. I don't support this because there's still discrimination and people don't marry into another caste - *reservation is not for matrimony and discrimination, reservation is for giving more representation to particular communities and to give resources and opportunities. There's SC/ST atrocities prevention Act for discrimination*\n\n4. There are very few rich people in SC/ST category, most examples in.comment are anecdotal. Not more than 1% of SC/STs are rich and have all the resources to compete.\n\n- **Okay I believe you only 1% of SC/STs are rich and have resources. So What about creating separate reservation for those 1% people . Today at central level 22.5% is reserved for SC/STs , 1% of 22.5 is 0.225, but let's make it 10% 2.25 , okay just round it to 2.5%.**\n\n\n****So, what if 2.5% is given to those anecdotal 1% SC/STs and remaining 20% to rest of poor SC/STs(99%).\nWhat's your Opinion now??****"<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'hnuzmj'<br />Flair :OC ‡§π‡•à ‡§¨‡•á!</li><li>Title: 'Free online Gita class'<br />Body: 'tldr; freee online class on zoom everyday at 9.30pm ist\n\nits pretty cool\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§® ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§ï ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ( ‡§ï‡•á‡§µ‡§≤ ‡§¨‡•Å‡§ß‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§õ‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§ï‡§∞)\n\nFree Geeta class\n\n‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø : oman ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø 7:45 ‡§¨‡§ú‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡•Ø ‡§¨‡§ú‡•á\n\n‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡•Ø:15 ‡§∏‡•á ‡•ß‡•¶:‡•©‡•¶ ‡§¨‡§ú‡•á\n\n Zoom meeting app ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§á‡§è‡§ó‡§æ‡•§ ‡§ï‡•É‡§™‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ó‡•Ç‡§ó‡§≤ ‡§™‡•ç‡§≤‡•á ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•á zoom meeting app install Kar kijiye\n\n Meeting Topic: Srimad Geeta study class\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n\n[https://us04web.zoom.us/j/9221493262?pwd=akVVUXNkM1ljK29aVUN0V21zVVBIdz09](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/9221493262?pwd=akVVUXNkM1ljK29aVUN0V21zVVBIdz09)\n\nMeeting ID: 922 149 3262\n\nPassword: 991688'<br />Author: 'bruin420'<br />id: 'hnps11'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: "Former Indian diplomat Deepak Vohra's amazingly insightful interview..And predicts Winnie the Pooh will have to quit by year end...Must watch"<br />Body: 'He shares his own experience in dealing with Chinese and offers great insight. \n\nLink:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IabG7XB2XLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IabG7XB2XLg)'<br />Author: 'sharmaji_ka_damaad'<br />id: 'hnppef'<br />Flair :CKMKB</li><li>Title: 'Must watch video for all indians'<br />Body: '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmxJpBDgtRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmxJpBDgtRU)'<br />Author: 'bruin420'<br />id: 'hnpn1c'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Buying a musical instrument !!!'<br />Body: 'Hello Bhratas jai Raam ji ki\n\ni am planning to buy a ukelele for my personal entertainment (not like clicking photos and uploading on FB and shit)\n\nis it good ? or i go for something else which is easy to learn (not going for guitar cuz every other person owns one)\n\nwhat are the things i should keep watch of when i buy ukelele? and is there any good online websites to purchase one ?'<br />Author: 'syntaxerrormau5'<br />id: 'hnmwcq'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'I gave up writing a title!'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hnms5e'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'How to convince my parents?'<br />Body: "Hello I'm a new born child.\n\nI just got to know about the fAsCisT RaCisT HiNdU sUpReMaCisT MuDi.

Both of her parents are engineers , father in Indian Telecom Services and mother is IES.  (she took voluntary retirement , so she can help Tina give more time to her studies. I can see \\*\\*Brahminical Patriarchy\\*\\* here), and I am assuming that if you have that background , you are fairly rich and maybe come in the top10% rich in India.  \nso , she's not a SC person who can't afford resources and facing major daily life problems which a poor SC person faces.  \nI know she's a Topper, but she still cleared the CSE Pre just because of SC reservation, she only cleared the SC cutoff (that's her strategy she didn't give Pre that much weightage because she want to focus on Mains and just want to clear the cutoff for Pre).  \n\n\nSo, my question is why a person who have almost same resources as any other caste/religion/tribe person needs reservation more than a person who don't and belongs to SC/ST community.  \n\n\nI don't have problem with Tina Dabi , I respect her , she has done wonderful job in Bhilwara during Covid early stage.  \nMy problem is we have limited college seats , limited jobs , limited opportunities . So why a person who benefited or not need that extra push get those benefits and who don't have the resources has to compete with them.  \n\n\nA poor SC candidate who's working hard for the one seat one job is not competing against a General OBC ST candidtae but competing against the rich SC who has all the resources to get benefit of 15% quota.  \nAnother example of Rajasthan there is 12% ST reservation but of this reservation most of the beneficiary are from single caste which is even not a Tribal caste i.e \\*\\*Meena\\*\\*. (Meena caste included by typist mistake as a Tribal caste)  \nSo, Is it not unfair to other Tribal caste in Rajasthan that all the fruit of reservation is taken by a single caste which has enough resources which they (other tribal castes) don't have.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*I will give one more example. There are 100 apples, and the distributor set aside 25 apples for a particular village because it's far away from the distribution center. \n\nSo, the policy of distribution is first come first serve. So, that particular village which is far away from the center has 500 people who wants that apples\n\nBut the thing is out of these 500 peoples some has Cars , some has Bikes, some has cycles and most of them are just walking towards the center, and some are they want the apple but can't leave their house because they had to take care of family members. \n\nSo as we know there's only 25 apples are there specially for the village they can take more than 25 if they reach first there, So people who came in Cars and Bikes took the all 25 apples.  \n\n\nAnd the rest of people who came on bicycle or just bare foot walking , are as it is before there were apples , with no apples. And because they know all the apples will be taken by the people who have Cars and Bikes, they not gonna try again because why would you walk so much to get nothing.  \n\n\nSo, even after many attempts by the distributor there are many people who can't get any apples, and still thinks that the apples are not in their reach.  \n\n\nNow, questions may arise why there's only 100 apples, why everyone doesn't have a car, why there's no bus service, why the village is so far away from the distribution center etc etc. Yes , having only 100 apples is also a problem, Yes have no bus service is a problem. And we should improve these things.\n\nBut it still doesn't solve the present problem of a few people enjoying the fruit because they have resources to reach those places fast.\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nTL;DR  \n\n\nBy applying creamy layer in SC/ST will not hurt SC/ST but will do more wider benefit to newer people who don't have resources."<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'<br />id: 'hne0xx'<br />Flair :OC ‡§π‡•à ‡§¨‡•á!</li><li>Title: 'Full on jihad'<br />Body: 'Na paani se na khaad se \napni fasal pakti hai jihad se\n(Spam waah waah)'<br />Author: 'pkj_xd'<br />id: 'hnc7ya'<br />Flair :Jihad</li><li>Title: 'What are some Vrats/Upvas/Fast and rituals that can be followed by a bachelor that are simple to follow?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'hnbxwl'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'I oppose CAA'<br />Body: 'It has a deadline.'<br />Author: 'The_ZMD'<br />id: 'hn2gz2'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Pushpendra Kulshrestha subtle dig at Nehru lol'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hmzcp9'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi</li><li>Title: 'Lakshman ne Shurpanaka ki naak kat diya?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'scorpixie'<br />id: 'hmyxnd'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'RNDTV üíØ'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hmyjdi'<br />Flair :From Twitter</li><li>Title: 'In these troubling times, is it better to choose sides than to stay neutral?'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'Frosty_War'<br />id: 'hmyj9w'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: "Everyone I don't like is literally Hitler."<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hmu6f1'<br />Flair :High IQ</li><li>Title: 'Want to learn VBA for excel..

And as such it was a total failure for India and a long term victory for Pakistan.\n\nPakistan surrendered in Bengal. Not in punjab. We did not even make the return of PoK as a condition of ending the war. We did not impose any economic or military sanctions on West Pakistan as a condition of ending the war.\n\nSuch conditions are the perogative of the victor. To ensure that the enemy, in exchange for being spared, has to concede to a number of terms that take away its power to cause trouble for you again.\n\nWe extracted no such concessions. \n\nWe could have demanded that the return of PoK, unlimited access for Indian trade to cross Pakistan to Iran and central Asia, opening up of the Pakistani economy to Indian trade, restriction on the Pakistani military in the number of soldiers, officers, tanks and aircraft it could have, disbanding the Pakistani navy permanently and acknowledgement from Pakistan that Kashmir was an integral part of India, including PoK. \n\nWe did nothing. Nothing. We just ended the war. And gave back 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war for a worthless agreement that the Kashmir dispute would be solved bilaterally.\n\nWhat the hell was that? If nothing else, we could have ended the Kashmir issue there and then. We didn\'t even do that. \n\nWe just accepted the surrender in east Pakistan and closed the chapter. \n\nBecause the reality is that Indira only wanted enough to establish herself as the iron lady in the minds of Indians. She achieved that. She threw India and its future under the bus. And left Pakistan able and free to acquire nuclear weapons, which ensured we would not get the chance again, not for 50 years, perhaps never, and left Pakistan able to start terrorism campaigns across India, which it did, from punjab to kashmir to SIMI. \n\nAnd now we run around stroking ourselves about our supposedly great "victory".\n\nIt was not a victory. It was a betrayal. And has cost us so heavily that today we are surrounded and besieged internally and externally totally by the intense and devastating terrorist and diplomatic operations that Pakistan has been running against us after we ran away in 1971.\n\nWake up.\n\n*Taken from Harbir Singh\'s Facebook Post*'<br />Author: 'dukegabon'<br />id: 'hkl51a'<br />Flair :CongressKMKB</li><li>Title: 'Virat Words'<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'hkl40z'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: "A rebuttal to liberals' charge that Brahmins monopolized and controlled knowledge and education in India"<br />Body: "On the universality of knowledge in India, some say that the Vedas and their recitation were ‚Äòmonopolized‚Äô by Brahmins *(paraphrased)*.\n\nThis is an absurd charge, and not because it is wrong.\n\nThis is like saying that scientists monopolize NASA; or molecular biologists monopolize molecular biology; or quantum physicists monopolize quantum physics.\n\nIn a classic division of labor, India had divided society into four Varnas and Brahmins‚Äô lot was to further the knowledge tradition of India.\n\nThis DID NOT mean that others were barred from having knowledge.\n\nThis only meant that a particular way of pursuing knowledge: that is by reciting the Vedas and conducting Yajnas was reserved for the Brahmins and not others.\n\nOthers could gain knowledge in many other ways from Kathas, from Ramlilas, from other Natyas, from music, from poetry, from story-telling, from architecture, from sculpture, from other fine arts, for every discipline in India was geared towards Advaita, towards the Ultimate Knowledge.\n\nIt was just that a particular technical way of conducting a very technical ritual: that is Yajna and another very technical activity: that is reciting the Vedas was prohibited to all except the Brahmins.\n\nAnd what is wrong in that?\n\nThis is like saying that anyone with no study and degree of science should be published on quantum physics or molecular biology in their esteemed journals! Or that a poet or a businessman should be allowed to design the rocket to take our satellites to Mars!\n\nDoesn‚Äôt that sound ridiculous?\n\nThen why all this fuss over ‚ÄòBrahmins monopolizing knowledge‚Äô?\n\nTo repeat, they did not monopolize knowledge, but certain technical means of furthering it. To put it in other way, once an aspect of knowledge had been codified and researched, everyone could take benefit from it through the agency of various vehicles designed specifically to take knowledge to the masses ‚Äì like Natyashastra which has its stated goal to take the knowledge of the Vedas to the masses.\n\nBut to let anyone interfere with the process of creating and codifying knowledge would have meant the very destruction of the tools to gain knowledge. It would be like a postman designing the rocket at NASA.\n\nPursuing knowledge was considered not just a very important activity in India, but THE most important activity and an entire class was dedicated to it. For pursuing it in the most refined manner this class evolved a complete way to do it, an elaborate terminology, a vast repertoire of various different ways to approach ontology and epistemology, a grammar to comprehend it, a language to express it. It was impossible to do it for any other person who was employed in earning the daily livelihood. Only someone completely dedicated to the study of knowledge would be able to do it. Letting others do it would just mean the destruction of the means of gaining knowledge. This is why there was a prohibition on the 'means of knowledge' - but NEVER on knowledge itself.\n\nBut who cares about logic when ideology is at hand?\n\n*Taken from Satish K.

And another of my rants which a lot of you could find "rAnDiA SiMuLaTiOn? "\n\nSo, I have been following bhagwa feminism sub for a while now and I just got to know its creator and mods are men! I feel cheated. I am shaking and angry after knowing this. They have been insinuating that it is for women and though I saw a few men commenting I thought it was fine, maybe some are following out of "curosity". I also do not know if this subs mods and that ones are same or know each other and I do not care if I get banned from both.\n\nDear women on this sub, if you follow that sub please know this truth, that men are moderating it. I am angry because I was almost going to share a personal  experience which was similar to the incident mentioned in the news.\n\nI dont understand why men feel entitled to give direction to women? As an aware Hindu Sanghi woman, I feel, I have to battle on two fronts, I have to battle misogyny and ignorance from men whom I share my ideology with and then simultaneously fight left liberals too.\n\nThis doesn\'t arise from just a one off incident. I am a part of one of the sister organisations of RSS and recently there were some developments there, which irked me and irritated too and while the men in the group felt differently, I talked to my female professor-like mentor, quite aged, about it and we both felt the same. Even when the first seminar concluded, I could see women of all age groups, still left unanswered because main speaker ne wohi purane ghise pite dialogues chipka diye aur ye nahin bataya ki woh sab, jo required h krna, woh krne ke baad bhi unn questions ko, unse arise hone wali problems ka kya karein? Kyunki woh sirf male community ko address krke change ki ja skti hai. \n\nDecade after decade, I see the same old tradition of schooling women about the culture and the traditions and umpteen number of rules to abide by. While I find it extremely absurd, because all around me I see aware Hindu women, doing that and much more already. What I don\'t see is men modifying for better, even the ones that I share my ideology with! They\'re the same, entitled kinds! They don\'t want to be sensitized, they don\'t want to end their ignorance or aware themselves about a number of everyday problems faced by women and just, look through a different perspective.\n\nDear centre to right, aware Hindu men, you could be different from liberals. You could behave differently and act mature. However I do understand it is quite impossible to achieve on social media platforms, but if you want to stand out, you should try. When women vent their frustration about the unfortunate-biased-ghastly incidents of their life, don\'t parade around with "this is misandry" and "not all men". Ofc not all men, it is a given. WE KNOW THAT. But this absolutely looks like you are belittling her struggles and the disgusting experiences she has to carry all her life.\n\n#enough of gaslighting'<br />Author: 'paharganj2paris'<br />id: 'hje21c'<br />Flair :Rant</li><li>Title: 'Indian woman, 29, wins ¬£5,000 Commonwealth short story prize for Hindu-Muslim love story'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'AliensWontTalkToMe'<br />id: 'hj812z'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'JEE MAINS Hoga ki Nahi BC?'<br />Body: 'Gaand phati PADI hei'<br />Author: 'olbillyboyy'<br />id: 'hj7zn1'<br />Flair :Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Jihadi: *is born*.

His famous work is KirƒÅtƒÅrjunƒ´ya ( Of Arjuna and the KirƒÅta) which is in 18 cantos.\n\nIt is noted among Sanskrit critics both for its gravity or depth of meaning, and for its forceful and sometimes playful expression. \n\nHis poetry is characterised by its intricate styles and ethereal expressions. Like **KƒÅlidƒÅsa-**UpamƒÅ KƒÅlidƒÅsasya and **Da·πá·∏çin**\\-da·πá·∏çina·∏• padalƒÅlitya·πÉ similarly his work is said to be arthagauravam (Weight of meaning).\n\nThe *KirƒÅtƒÅrjunƒ´ya*  "is regarded to be the most powerful poem in the Sanskrit language". A. K. Warder considers it the "most perfect epic available to us", over A≈õvagho·π£a\'s *Buddhacarita*, noting its greater force of expression, with more concentration and polish in every detail. Despite using extremely difficult language and rejoicing in the finer points of Sanskrit grammar, Bharavi achieves conciseness and directness. His alliteration, "crisp texture of sound", and choice of metre closely correspond to the narrative.\n\n**The literary Genius of his work KirƒÅtƒÅrjunƒ´ya\\~**\n\nThe work is known for its brevity, depth (*arthagauravam*), and verbal complexity. At times, the narrative is secondary to the interlaced descriptions, elaborate metaphors and similes, and display of mastery in the Sanskrit language. Notably, its fifteenth canto contains *chitrakavya*, decorative composition, including the fifteenth verse with "elaborate rhythmic consonance" noted for consisting of just one consonant: \n\n‡§® ‡§®‡•ã‡§®‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•ã‡§®‡•ã ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§®‡§æ ‡§®‡§®‡•Å ‡•§      na nonanunno nunnono nƒÅnƒÅ nƒÅnƒÅnanƒÅ nanu ‡•§  \n‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•ã‡§Ω‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•ã ‡§®‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§®‡•ã ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§®‡§æ ‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§®‡•Å‡§§‡•ç ‡••       nunno\'nunno nanunneno nƒÅnenƒÅ nunnanunnanut ‡•• \n\n *Translation*: –û ye many-faced ones (*nƒÅnƒÅnanƒÅ*), he indeed (*nanu*) is not a man (*na nƒÅ*) who is defeated by an inferior (*≈´na-nunno*), and that man is no man (*nƒÅ-anƒÅ*) who persecutes one weaker than himself (*nunnono*).
