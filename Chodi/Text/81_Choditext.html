To give a short description, QNet is an MLM which has been banned in many countries, has several FIRs against its members in various cities of India and operates like your standard MLM - you join by paying a hefty amount, then you bring more people under you who go on to do the same and so on. They have some fancy, luxurious products which are heavily overpriced (20 green tea teabags for Rs.1500, 500 ml honey for Rs.1000, etc etc).\n\nNow he has had a tough time during since 2018, I’ll give him that. He first lost his well paying government job due to some fraud allegations, for which he had to haemorrhage money like anything to keep his name out of FIR, chargesheet, etc etc (This is what my family and I were told while loaning money from us. I don’t know whether the charges were true, if the money really went for paying the lawyer, bribing the cops, etc. Let’s keep that aside for a while). He had purchased a new house and car just before his job termination, which meant regular EMIs. So I can understand that he was the perfect Bakra for whoever lured him into this QNet. His state of mind would have been terrible with so much debts, EMIs that QNet would seem like the perfect plan to him. Get rich quick.\n\nIt has been 2 years now since his job termination and I estimate he got into QNet in 2019, after his official job termination letter came from his organisation . And he is still draining money, only now in QNet. I don’t understand how he cannot see the fraud in this. Till now I had kept quiet and had just starting ignoring his calls, texts, etc even though he had borrowed a significant amount of money from me as well, but I was furious when I came to know yesterday that he tried his QNet fraud on one cousin sometime in 2019 only. This cousin doesn’t even have a job and earns a decent amount by giving home tuitions. This loser took him to a QNet meeting, gave my cousin the usual deal, and my completely enamoured cousin “invested” his savings of one year, around Rs.25000. Some of you might say that it was my cousin’s mistake, but mind you, he’s just a kid, only 24 years old, who has never gone out of our hometown. He is not a Dilliwala or some clever guy. Plus, the position of respect &amp; trust of his Jija Jee was enough to assure of cousin that his money is safe. I don’t blame him. Poor kid has not told a soul in this world about his loss, not his family, not his own brother, fearing souring of relations between 2 families and of course the fear of getting scolded by his parents for being so gullible.\n\nMy mom, uncle and I, all have given money to this relative during his job termination hassle days. He kept on telling us that things are getting sorted on his organisation’s end, he might get reinstated, he just needs to pay so and so lawyer, so and so union, so and so cop and we never questioned him. But after he attended his first QNet conference with his whole family in Delhi, we had all adopted the path of ignoring him and just being in touch with my sister for being updated. But after this cousin scandal has come in my knowledge, I feel all elders need to step in. \n\nI don’t know what bullshit he fed his family that they went to attend the conference with him. My sister says they have daily fights over this in which he gives statements like “Whatever Google says doesn’t mean is true, if it’s a scam then why is the company running since so many years, the day I will have money I will show everyone it is not a scam”, etc etc. I don’t know why his father lent him money to invest, what lies he fed him, or that his father is just a plain, old man who himself got duped by own son. Right now, his own father is running his household and my sister teaches in a small play school. This guy has no shame left and puts WhatsApp status denigrating 9-5 jobs, shares videos of BMWs, Rolex, etc with “motivational quotes” of Jack Ma, Elon Musk, APJ Kalam, etc. My blood boils on seeing this. My sister frequently shares her plight with me and I feel helpless. I really care for them , my whole family does and it’s heartbreaking to see this downfall of a hardworking, talented man. I don’t know why his own father doesn’t kick him out of their house and leave him to fend from himself. This guy has no worry in the world. He knows no relative from whom he’s taken money is going to ask for it, his household is running, he’s getting his food cooked, clothes washed, etc. He even has a 2 year old daughter. I have told my sister numerous times to just go back to our house for some time so that this loser realises something at least, but I don’t know what stops her. (Her sasural and maayka are both in same locality). Maybe she thinks things will get better. I don’t know.\n\nHow do I bring this man back from this mess? I know I can’t do much, since I am younger to him so I don’t command that influence over him or can’t even give some dhamki to knock some sense, but what can my mother, uncle or his father do? I feel kicking him out of the house is one way and they can do that easily I feel- they have 2 houses in the city, one belongs to father, one is the newly bought one that belongs to him. Just leave the loser to fend from himself. Why are his parents paying for his ration?\n\nHas anyone amongst you ever seen such a case and have seen anyone come out of this? What kind of threats can my family or his family give to him? Is that even the way to go, or should we proceed with love and care? Basically anything to bring him back to senses? Any legal route?'<br />Author: '2throwawaythrowaway'<br />id: 'g79es5'<br />Flair :Butthurt OP</li><li>Title: 'Covid-19 is an opportunity for India to become a manufacturing hub but some NGOs and China are halting it.'<br />Body: 'One of the most immediate consequences of the Coronavirus outbreak and the growing resentment against Beijing, has been a prospective shift in Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) from China to India. For decades, China has been hailed as the “world’s factory”, over its low labour costs and export-driven economy. But foreign companies are now [looking](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/we-are-over-dependent-on-china-1000-firms-wish-to-come-to-india-covid-19-proves-why-india-is-the-best-destination/amp/) to exit China and their preferred choice to relocate, is of course, India. \n\n***However, before we get too excited, we must recall the horrendous experiences with NGOs which have overturned India’s chances at getting FDI with various agitations.***\n\n Japanese companies are looking for a new location after the Shinzo Abe government announced a package worth US $2.2 billion to help manufacturers [shift](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/pack-up-and-get-out-of-there-japan-to-pay-2-2-billion-to-get-japanese-companies-to-exit-china/) production out of China. The state of Uttar Pradesh, led by CM Yogi Adityanath is now planning to [woo](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/leave-china-and-come-to-up-yogi-government-plans-special-package-to-woo-companies-fleeing-china/) these companies fleeing China.\n\nAlso exiting China are South Korean majors such as Hyundai Steel and POSCO are looking to exit China and they plan to set up their factories in the state of Andhra Pradesh, in what can be a massive boost for PM Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and FDI inflows into India. \n\nThe fast-changing world order goes very much in India’s favour and can propel India’s ambitions of becoming a US $ 5 trillion by 2024. In fact, foreign companies exiting China and entering India has long term benefits, as India could become the new engine of world growth. \n\n***At the forefront of this anti-development campaign to block foreign investments is the NGOs nexus that directly or indirectly sabotages crucial projects in the garb of farmer rights or environmental vigilantism.***\n\n According to a 2014 Intelligence Bureau (IB) [report](https://timesofindia.com/india/Foreign-funded-NGOs-stalling-development-IB-report/articleshow/36411169.cms), foreign-funded NGOs such as Greenpeace, Cordaid, Amnesty and Action Aid have been\xa0 “serving as tools for foreign policy interests of western governments” by sponsoring agitations against nuclear and coal-fired power plants in India. For eg.\n\n*In Tamil Nadu, protests had led to the closure of Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper Plant in Tuticorin, which not only hurt the copper industry but also thousands of medium and small sector units whose businesses were dependent on Vedanta’s plant.Later, Chinese companies were* [*alleged*](https://tfipost.com/2019/06/vedanta-chinese-sterlite-protests-01/amp/) *to have funded the anti-Sterlite protests in India that actually had a very negative impact on India’s Copper production,* [*forcing*](https://tfipost.com/2019/10/india-imports-copper-for-the-first-time-in-18-years-reason-the-shutdown-of-sterlite-plant/amp/) *the country to import Copper for the first time in 18 years.*\n\n ***The ambitious*** [***Hyperloop***](https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2020/01/18/maharashtra-puts-brakes-on-hyperloop-richard-bransons-worst-fear-comes-true.html) ***and*** [***Bullet train***](https://tfipost.com/2019/12/stalling-bullet-train-would-mean-uddhav-inviting-pm-modis-wrath-and-pm-modi-wont-be-kind/) ***projects in Maharashtra- both of which could have accelerated the state’s growth unprecedentedly have also run into trouble ever since the Uddhav Thackeray government came to power in Maharashtra***. \n\nAnd this is not just about specific cases of protests, especially in the tribal, Naxal-dominated areas. The sheer vigilantism of the NGOs has led to obnoxious legislation like the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.\n\nThis Act has created [bottlenecks](https://economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/five-years-on-has-land-acquisition-act-fulfilled-its-aim/articleshow/65639336.cms) for several projects such as POCSO’s steel project in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, and US investments in the Modi government’s flagship “Smart Cities” [project](https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-us-tells-india-to-resolve-land-acquisition-fdi-issues-to-set-up-smart-cities-2081432).\n\n# Today, a number of companies are looking towards India, but the mighty Dragon won’t let the situation go out of its hands so easily. It might try to collude with the foreign funded NGOs in India, in order to push against its Indian competitors.\n\nThe foreign funding of NGOs keeps [going up,](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/opinion-foreign-donations-with-hidden-agenda-are-serious-danger-to-indias-national-security/346340) despite the Modi government [tightening](https://tfipost.com/2018/04/ngos-fcra-01/) the screws under the FCRA norms. The NGOs will in all probability continue with their hidden agenda, and it is time for the Modi government to effectively address all key stakeholders.\n\nIndia offers the perfect conditions for any MNC, but the ambitions to emerge as a “manufacturing hub” could go down the drain given the hostile NGO ecosystem and networks within India.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28jz5fr3cru41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136492244085f7d8345e1e727c684b18ba395cda'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'g77bnd'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li><li>Title: 'Testing AntoniaMaino bot, need help in case the tests fail.'<br />Body: "Due to a post I saw where someone was suggesting to make a sonia gandhi bot.

These civil society   groups, supported, funded and controlled by some western intelligence and church agencies, pose a very grave threat to the very survival of India as a sovereign nation. \n\nMany of these organizations which were first established in India as charity organizations, later changed their colour and started showing their fangs by supporting various militant and  secessionist movements in the country. The NGO and human rights activism got a big boost in the early 1970s with the patronage it received from Sonia Gandhi who came to India in 1968.\n\n The origin of many militant people’s movements like Narmada Bachao Andolan and Kastakari  Sanghatana which were started in the mid-1970s and the take over of the Maoist movement by the pro-US NGO lobby can be traced to this NGO-Sonia nexus. With Rajiv Gandhi becoming the Prime Minister of India in 1984, there was a substantial increase in the NGO lobby’s political influence in the country with the successful induction of many of its nominees into key positions of power in the administration under different ministries. \n\n **FOUR CRUCIAL LEGISLATIONS In 1992**, two very important legislations i.e. 73d and 74th amendments to the Constitution were passed by the Parliament, with the avowed objective of strengthening the institutions of Panchayat Raj and urban bodies through decentralization of power, allegedly meant to allow the people at the lowest level to take part in the decision making process. Some NGO activists had played a very key, but behind-the- scene role, in getting these two amendment bills passed in the Parliament. It was under the pressure of these activists  and also with the support of the top leadership of the Congress party, the Constitution (73d and 74th )   Amendment Bills, were finally passed by the Parliament in  December, 1992.  Another important legislation called Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, (PESA),  which granted extension of the idea of local self-governance to tribal regions in the country, was also passed by the Parliament in 1996. The PESA was enacted on the basis of the recommendations of the Bhuria Committee.   For details see [This](https://imgur.com/a/jY0VyJV).\n\n In 2006, another NGO-sponsored Bill, called ‘The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forests Rights) Act, 2006 was passed by the Parliament, which granted the right of ownership of land and control over minor forest produce and natural resources to the inhabitants of the tribal areas. This Act, also called the Forest Rights Act, was originally drafted by some NGO activists led by Pradip Prabhu, an NGO leader working among the tribals of Thane district in Maharashtra. Pradeep Prabhu had also conducted a nation- wide campaign by holding morchas and demonstrations throughout the country in association with other like-minded activist groups in other states to mobilize support for this Bill.\n\n As per this new Act, Panchayats in tribal areas have now become the controlling authority for forest  management at the ground level, replacing the control of the Forest Department.   In a federal republic like India, it is the Union government and various state governments that wield all the powers and perform all the functions of the government. With the passage of the 73d and 74th Amendment to the Constitution Acts, the division of powers and functions of the government have now been trickled down to local self governments i.e. Panchayats and Gram Sabhas in rural areas and Ward Committees and Area (Mohalla) Committees in urban areas.\n\n With the passage  of PESA Act and the Forest Rights  Act, the Schedule-V areas and tribal areas have also been brought under the purview of this three-tier system of governance. But, why should the civil society activists, who have been supporting all anti-national movements in India like the  Maoist movement, Kashmiri separatists, Tamil nationalist organizations and agitations against various mega development projects in India, have suddenly become the champions of a Gandhian concept like Gram Swaraj and empowerment of Gram Sabhas, Mohalla Sabhas &amp; Forest Panchayats? The NGO lobby’s sudden love and interest in empowering the Gram Sabhas and its proclaimed aim to strengthen the Panchayat Raj system has some sinister designs.\n\n Their aim is not simply to strengthen the Panchayat Raj, but to take control of the empowered Panchayat institutions throughout the country. When the provisions of the Panchayat Raj are fully implemented, there would not be much powers left with the state and district administration and those who control the Panchayat institutions in rural areas and Mohalla Sabhas in urban areas  would become the real rulers of the country. \n\n ***WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE GRAM SABHA, NO MINING PROJECT WHETHER IT IS COAL, BAUXITE, IRON ORE OR URANIUM*** can be undertaken by the government, or any development project can come up under the jurisdiction of the Gram Sabha and the Mohalla Sabha. In rural areas, where the major industrial and  development projects are concentrated and new ones are scheduled to come up, the Gram Sabhas are almost fully under the control of the NGO activist groups. It is with such sinister designs that the militant NGOs are concentrating on organizing the masses in the remote rural and tribal areas and pressing for full implementation of the 73d and 74th amendment of the Constitution.\n\n***It is easy for the foreign-funded NGOs, who work in the remote tribal and rural areas to influence the poor and illiterate village  elders by bribing them with liquor and money and control the Gram Sabhas. Militant NGOs have already established their control over thousands of Gram Sabhas in states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra.***\n\nThe Gram Sabhas are now used by the NGO-sponsored anti-development lobby to stall hundreds of mega development projects, including coal, bauxite and other mining projects, in these states in a bid to stall our economic progress at the behest of their funding agencies in the west.  For instance, all the 12 Gram Gabhas controlled by the NGO lobby in Rayagada and Kalahandi districts of Odisha have voted against the Rs.50000 crore aluminium refinery project of Vedanta Resources in the Niyamagiri hills in August, 2013. \n\nThe grand strategy of the NGO lobby to build up militant people’s movements all over the country and cultivating/inducting a large network of agents in various  ministries and government departments, including the judiciary and armed forces, finally resulted in the creation of a gigantic octopus-\n\n ***like NGO war machine with its tentacles tightening its grip over the entire country with every passing day.***\n\n This was made possible because of the help and close cooperation extended to the NGO  lobby by Sonia Gandhi from the seventies onwards. This so-called dream concept of Swaraj is actually a  cunning strategy devised by the western intelligence agencies to grant total autonomy and self-rule to all the states in India by using the sweet terms like empowering the Gram Sabhas and Mohalla Sabhas all across India. \n\nWith various militant and separatist movements dominating many border states and interior parts of India, what could happen to the idea of India if total autonomy and self-rule is granted to such regions? \n\n# Clearly the only aim of crooks like Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, Jairam Ramesh and Mani Shankar Aiyar, who are the staunchest supporters of this ‘Swaraj’ movement, is to facilitate the process of India’s Balkanization as desired by their masters in the west.\n\n[Source](https://twitter.com/WindsOfChange72/status/1253280172855439360)'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'g729hx'<br />Flair :Research</li><li>Title: 'Where is the milk ?'<br />Body: 'आखिर दूध जा कहॉ रहा है ??\n\nचाय पीते पीते अचानक ही ख़याल आया !\nसमय हो तो आप भी गहन विचार कीजिए -\n\nलगातार जारी इस लाकडाउन की वज़ह से - \n(1) सारी चाय की दुकानें व चाय के ठेले बंद हैं ।\n(2) सारी मिठाई की दुकानें बंद हैं।\n(3) सारे रेस्टोरेन्ट बंद हैं।    \n(4) शादी, विवाह, बर्थडे , एवं अन्य प्रकार की कोई पार्टियॉ नहीं हो रही हैं ।\n(5) चाट के ठेले नहीं लग रहे । \n            \n            तो फिर इनमें खपने वाला हजारों लीटर दूध कहां  जा रहा है ?\n दूध वालो ने अतिरिक्त दूध रास्ते पर भी नहीं फेंका है। \n हमे सस्ते दामों में भी दूध नहीं दे रहे हैं।\n हमारे घर में जितना दूध आ रहा था आज भी उतना ही आ   रहा है।और दूध को रखा भी नहीं जा सकता ।\n\nक्या सचमुच बाजार में इतने बडे़ पैमाने पर कृत्रिम दूध का धंधा चल रहा था ?\n\n            बात तो सोचने की है ना ?????'<br />Author: '_bazinga_____'<br />id: 'g719eb'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'Help me understand'<br />Body: 'Are the commenters on r/PyongYang real?

A morning read for everyone busy in making memes.'<br />Body: 'We can see all these manifestations of Adharma today in our society. There are a number of inimical forces like Islamism and evangelism trying to break India and dismantle Hinduism\n\nIn short, ‘doing nothing’ is no longer an option. Doing-nothing implies being passive collaborators of forces inimical to Hindu civilization.\n\n# The Three P’s for Hindu Survival\n\nThe Three P’s are: **Preserve, Protect, and Promote**.\n\nPreserving Hindu civilization implies preserving and enriching our knowledge systems, traditions, institutions, and practices.\n\nProtecting Hindu civilization implies protecting all our traditions and practices from internal as well as external attacks. It involves the protection of our self-hood and prevention of distortion of our beliefs, knowledge, and practices. involves the protection of our self-hood and prevention of distortion of our beliefs, knowledge, and practices.\n\nPromoting Hindu civilization implies promoting our knowledge, practices, and values to the external world. It is vital for us to involve in such promotion that provides access to authentic knowledge and practices for the good of humanity and at the same time ensure that dilution and digestion of those knowledge practices are prevented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Hindus can do as Individuals:\n\n**On preservation front:**\n\n* If one is of intellectual bent, he/she can take up study of the Shastras.\n* Such study itself could be divided into various specialization: Veda-adhyayana, Dharmashastra, Arthashastra, Kamashastra, Itihasa-Puranas, Kavya, Vyakarana, Ayurveda, folk knowledge, etc.\n* A deeper study of these knowledge systems, as well as adding newer research, newer insights, and making the teachings contextual and contemporary to our times is vital.\n* One could also take up any art form- music, dance, theatre, painting, sculpting, folk, classical, to name a few. Such immersion in the art would include both an immersion in the theory and practice of it.\n* One could take up Yoga, Meditation, Ayurveda, Jyotishya, Tantra, etc. all of which represent our Knowledge traditions. These must be studied as a part of Hindu traditional knowledge and not as isolated subjects divorced from traditions.\n* Those of devotional bent must learn stotras, bhajans, take up Katha-vachans, etc.\n* One could even take up Indian traditions of Maths and Science and work to revive them!\n* Preservation of language and literature is another important field.\n* More importantly, parents must educate themselves about Hindu culture and pass on that education to their children. Encourage the children to immersion in Hindu culture and tradition.\n* It is also important for Hindus to donate to preservation of Hindu knowledge systems and practices through donating to various organizations including Veda pathashalas, theatre, art, music, etc. that would help preserve and pass on the knowledge to future generations.\n\n**On the protection front:**\n\n* Hindus need to organize themselves at Mohalla levels. Individuals must take initiatives to bring about such local-level organizing.\n* To begin with, people with similar bent could meet up and draw up an agenda of activities at the local level. Friends, family, and office colleagues could be brought into whenever and wherever possible.\n* Such Mohalla level meetings must focus on local level civilizational issues and then focus upon larger national level issues. Such discussions should not be mere theoretical but include a SWOT analysis and evolve action-oriented plans.\n* They could then evolve various strategies to preserve, protect and promote Hindu civilization and Hindu interests.\n* Awareness campaigns in the form of talks, presentations, etc. could be organized to not only sensitize people about the burning issue, but also for educating the people about Hindu philosophy and values.\n* Programs designed to fulfil preserve, promote, protect goals could be undertaken at Mohalla or city-levels.\n* Active Hindu community groups must be formed especially in demographically critical areas to cater to Hindu interests and counter inimical forces.\n* Wherever possible, physical training, body-fitness regimens, and fighting skills should be imparted, especially to youth and children.\n* Proper education and sensitization of youth to civilizational issues, Hindu history, Hindu philosophy is very much needed.\n* Imparting strong civilizational values and facilitating physical training at combat &amp; self-defense to the children-both boys and girls- is something that Hindu parents must pro-actively pursue.\n* Protection is not only at a physical level, but also at the psychological and narrative level.\n* Hindus should take up the study of deeper aspects of the civilization and counter distortions and negative narratives in the media and academia.\n* Narrative building and on-the-ground activism are both needed.\n* Talks, Workshops, Book-discussion events must be organized.\n* Students must be taught the essentials of Hindu philosophy, practice, history, and civilizational values. Education and rootedness in the civilization must be taken up big away.\n* Hindus must actively partake in social activities wherever possible. Hunger is one of the biggest issue and a social responsibility. Hindus should make a collective effort to ensure no Hindu in the community goes hungry. This would help in developing solidarity in society as well.\n* Hindu families must keep a small portion of their income as ‘Dharmaansh’ and use that money to support organizations, people, and initiatives that pertain to the preservation, protection, and promotion of Hindu causes. Donations could be done to Gaushalas, Veda-Patashalas, Ashrams that are preserving our civilizational ethos or to groups such as Upword, People for Dharma, Indic Collective, India Pride Project, etc. who are working on countering anti-Hindu bias at narrative and legal level.\n* Activism is another important area that Hindus must take up. Those in the legal profession must take up Legal activism in the interest of Hindu society and civilization. Those in the intellectual sphere (media and academia) must take up intellectual activism and counter anti-Hindu bias in media and academia. Those who are in the political sphere must take up Hindu activism at the political level. Lobbying for Hindu interests must be taken up big away at local, state, and national levels.\n\n**On the promotion front**\n\nA lot of activities could be done to promote authentic knowledge without dilution or distortion: Courses, Workshops, Retreats, etc.\n\nThese are merely some of the suggestions that Hindus can implement as individuals. Not everyone can do everything. Every Hindu individual must choose what he/she is inclined to and he/she has competency for. While some may be more inclined to take up intellectual activities, others may be more of a devotion-bent; while some are good at organizing people, some others may be good at combat. We need a collective effort and such an effort if done broadly in the direction of three P’s, then it is definitely possible to not only ensure the survival of Hindu civilization but also its re-blossoming.

There has to be  some guy who can come and unite India strongly. And take care of the  radical polarizing leaders as well. Until that happens we will always  remain the DSI.\n\nIf you  look at our history, we have been always divided. Every time an invader  tried to conquer India there was some traitor or the other who would go  onto the enemy\'s side and try to gain something.\n\nIf  an invader was attacking Punjab/Rajasthan then there would be no help  from other states. Those states were left to defend on their own while  the other states could develop their economy rather than military. It\'s  the "tu mare to mar. Mai apne mein mast hoon." There might have been  exceptions to this so please don\'t waste my time with the exceptions.  The majority of states have been like this only.\n\nWhy?  Because they all had individual kings / princes who had only one  motive. Continue to be the king of small land rather than have a united  and stronger India.\n\nBack in the  days after British independence, there was a big task to unite all  states together. Do you know why? Because those M.C. people just said  "whoever wants to create independent country for their state can do so.  Whoever wants to unite to a common country can do so". There is a whole  documentary on this called "**Pradhan Mantri**" if you haven\'t seen. And  every state wanted to be an independent country. That is the India I  have seen.\n\nEven today if any of  you are in college or working, let me ask you something. How do you get  treated from people from other states? I have good, close friends from  almost every state in India. But many of those are exceptions. The  majority of people you will see hang out with people from their own  states and will shun you. Why? Because you don\'t speak their mother  tongue.\n\nLook in offices. Its only  here in India that you get to see the boss fires, saves people based on  their religion. You will get less work and easy promotion if your boss  if from the same mother tongue as yours. In particular this is extremely  rampant across specific statesmen to such a degree that you can hear an  event about a manager and immediately guess which state they\'re from.  But I am not here to take names.\n\nLook at the people from other states. How do they talk? "Oh you\'re from my state?" - and instant connection.\n\nIndia  is currently divided. But it doesn\'t need to be that way. It can be  united. Provided we have just 5-10 people in the power position who  actually want to unite India. There is NO ONE. Bastardwood just wants to  make money with bar dances, muslim appeasement and "love" stories.  Beejinez people have made enough money to last generations don\'t have to  work. They can do awareness and bring India together. No. They just  want to make more money until their last breath. Such great people.

He wasn't part of 1998 tour when Tendulkar swept Warne into nightmares, he wasn't part of Sharjah Cup when Tendulkar decimated Warne, he wasn't part of 2003-04 series as well, and Tendulkar missed half the matches in the 2004 series in India - which was their last Test series opportunity as McGrath would retire one year before the next series.\n\nCome to think of it, the only time Sachin won against Mcgrath was ICC knockout trophy.\n\nHe even out Tendulkar out in the 2003 wc cup final.\n\nNot to mention the reason England won ashes 2005 was when he was out for both of the losing test matches\n\nHe was a master of the sixth stump line, getting batsmen to play at balls they didn't really want to and knicking them off. Exactly the type of bowler you wouldn't want to face when just coming to the crease. 104 ducks from about 500ish wickets is insane, no wonder Australia was so dominant during that period.\n\nHe was the difference between Aus and Ind teams of the 00s. Both had dominant Batting lineups, support seamers and Spinners. What would I not give to have a GOAT like McGrath I'm our Test teams of the 00s.\n\nI've been watching his highlights, the guy always made sure the opposition lost 2 quick wickets and it was always the same, caught behind or edged to slip"<br />Author: 'turkishhawk_2410'<br />id: 'g5ax6b'<br />Flair :OC है बे!</li><li>Title: 'HINDUS speak up now, otherwise it would too late.'<br />Body: 'I think people who claimed to suffer due to the rise of Fascism in our land since 2014 will sure come to know in due to time what these horrors are like.\nI will gladly say, if actually there was a fascist regime in India.

Don't agree with them, and more important don't disagree with them.  If you are pushed for an opinion say you find this boring.  It is better to be considered stupid than right wing.\n\nThird, don't speak right wing stuff in public, but also don't fake being left wing/liberal just to stay with your friends.\n\nFourth, quietly practice distancing from muslims and christians.  You don't need to avoid them.  But as far as possible try to find people who belong to any community other than muslim and christian to give your business to... be it a 10 rupee cigarette or a 20,000 rupee television or a 10,00,000 car. platforms like uber and zomato do not allow you to choose non muslim servers so avoid them.

This was made specifically to make us fight. As a result the future generations were so divided that a handful of westerners tilled us for a long time. This correction was never made.\n\nMoreover Gandhi ji approved of caste system in this manner.\n\nSavarkar and ambhekar recommended the abolishing of caste system all together to make our people who have chosen a different faith path to god to come back to the dharma of the land. All this is out there but never revealed or even discussed in the 70 years of "independence" (why ? Because we were the pawns all along)\n\nAfter modi this changed, their narrative exposed them more and more.\n\nPlease unite I\'m indian,  I\'m a hindu and I\'m a son of this soil. You all are.

Madlad has actually sent his theory that the lizard folks of IB are controlling the country to the PM through the Ministry of Personal, Public grievance. Some snippets of his manifesto:\n"Sir, please read the message in its entirety!\n\n"Allah ho Akbar Allah"\nReverse this sentence and it turns into “Halla rab-ka oh halla” you know what it means in Hindi!\nNow take another example: “Jehad”, now reverse this word and it’ll turn into “Dahej” (dowry).\nI believe there are numerous such phrases and words in the Holy Quran that when reversed can give an altogether different meaning.\nThese words and phrases are being used by certain people (IB) to brainwash innocent naive Muslims and convert them into terrorists. When a Muslim who reads verses of Quran five times a day on daily basis is subjected to this kind of information, he gets mesmerized, astonished, goes docile and will follow the path laid down before him by his perpetrators even if it comes to blowing himself up in the name of God or believing in fighting a Holy war.\n\nThe information that I have mentioned above is more than two decades old. IB (my deduction points towards IB but I can\'t verify the same) used to hypnotize me since my childhood days. Once they received this piece of information they not only sat on it for more than 2 decades, they also used it. The Mumbai attacks, the stone pelters in Kashmir, the terrorism that exists in Kashmir are all being perpetrated by the IB.\n\n\nThere is no democracy in our country, we never attained freedom. The British ruled us for centuries and instilled IB, which organised and spread its network across India. You find them in every village, town and city. When the British left they appointed a few powerful people at the top who would control democracy and they always function with secrecy and never see the light.
