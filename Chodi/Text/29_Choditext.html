So how do we counter it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first attempt to counter it and would love to hear more suggestions and would encourage you to do such experiments of your own as well. I have submitted this post to both Indian based left wing and right wing subs. If any of these subs are majorly controlled by any such paid for astroturfing mods this post won't see the light of day and I intend to note those subs. Some of them might not be in it for the money and genuinely believe in their cause but use the above mentioned techniques to manipulate general public opinion and sentiments which is still not acceptable.     \n\nThe subs where this post makes it to the readers are probably safe and are not worried about their members coming across this piece of information. If you read this post and it has managed to change your perception, then leave a comment just sighting the percentage of content you now believe to be an outcome of astroturfing on this particular sub. This post in itself a kind of litmus test for the subs I have posted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason for posting this right now is that 2020 has come to an end making it six years since 2014 and four years since 2017 but never have I seen Left vs Right so polarized in history. I believe the exact phenomena mentioned in the above video is responsible for this. The drift between Left wing and right wing is being cultivated and nurtured intentionally using techniques such as astroturfing. This particular scenario is very dangerous and can only be tackled by ensuring that the citizens are aware and have a rational mindset."<br />Author: '95_red'<br />id: 'jlr1yz'<br />Flair ::Research: Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Explaining the animal headed gods of hinduism.'<br />Body: 'Hinduism is often mocked and slandered for its inclusion of Animalistic gods. Ganesha has an elephant head. Narasimha is a lion. Hayagriva is horse headed. There is Varaha, a boar. Matsya, a fish. Kurma, a turtle. Hanuman, a monkey and Garuda, a bird. These animal headed gods make hinduism appear primitve and strange to the western mind, Make it subject to scrutiny and insult. But there are explenations for these apparently strange forms.\n\nThe first explenation of these forms can be through symbolism. Let\'s look at Ganesha for example.\n\nThe elephant head represents intelligence required to discriminate and grow. His ears represent that god is all knowing, and listens to all. The rope in his hand represents how he can pull us on the right path. A modakh in his hand symbolises sweet spiritual bliss which he can provide. His rat (which a major point of yours) represents the erratic  mind, which is difficult to control, and him comfortably riding it represents how we too can control our own mind with all the above qualities.\n\nThese are all qualities which Ganesha is known to give, which is why they are part of his apperance.\n\nAt this point many will surely ask. If these forms are symbolic, are they not fiction?\n\nThis question can be answered here. In hinduism, there is ultimately one formless, supreme Brahman. This Brahman takes increasingly specific forms for increasingly specific purposes. The purpose of Ganesha, let us say, is to remove obstacles. As I have said, Ganesha\'s form is akin to that which he can give us. So, if the unmanifest Brahman can continue to manifest as Ganesha to devotees, though his form being symbolic, It would not be entirely right to call him fiction.\n\nHowever, this argument is still unconvincing to some. So, there can indeed be an entirely different approach to the animalistic gods.\n\nThis is especially true for Hindus who believe that such forms are for the weakminded and that symbolism is their ultimate meaning. Instead of recognising that Ganesha is a divine personality, he is simply\n\nWe can still say, that these forms exist to remind us that we must expand a limited understanding of god. Take Arjuna for example, who had a very limited understanding of god in the Gita, and to show him the true scale of what god is, Krishna proudly proclaims that he is present in every part of nature.\n\nIt shows us how God is truly everywhere, and there is no part of the world where he is not present.\n\nKnowing, this these animalistic forms of god can be interpreted as us celebrating that same reality, knowing that god is truly boundless, and there are no limits to his nature.\n\nKnowing this, rather than jumping to symbolism, why can\'t we instead answer with another question. "Is there a problem with Ganesha\'s head? If god is truly everywhere and manifest in any form, why not that of an elephant?"\n\nGod does not have any restriction on how he can be known. Hinduism recognises that god doesn\'t have to conform to what is considered as proper or conform to the conditions and judgments of the human mind. God can manifest in any form and this why even more unorthodox forms such as the Shaligramam or the Shiva linga are still worshipped and viewed as divine. In the Gita we hear Arjuna asking Krishna on how he can be known in this world. He responds:\n\n*Of mountains I am Meru..... Of immovable objects I am the Himalaya\'s...... Of Elephants I am Airavat, Among cows I am Surabhi..... Among Serpants I am Vasuki, Among beasts, I am the Lion, Of birds I am Garuda, of Fish I am the Shark, and of Rivers I am the Ganga (BG 10.23.31)*\n\nHe explains how who he really is is truly infinite. He is both part of the Universe, and beyond it.\n\nThis is why God is also represented as Animalistic. We can see through them that gods glory is everywhere, wherever we look, we can find him.\n\nBy accepting divinity in multiple and strange forms, we are then force to give up a fixed notion of god. We can thus see him in all places and can achieve an elevated concioussness.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jljf9f'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

The editor has worked with the great V.T. Rajashekar earlier and we have been inspired by him.\xa0Apart from Babasaheb and Kancha Ilaiah, VTR is\xa0our greatest inspiration. We have had several talks with VTR when he visited Oxford University in England. We have also had lengthy and stimulating discussions with VTR at his residence at palace lower orchards in Bangalore.\n\n# \xa0Bunts are a backward caste and VTR has written about it. Bunts are\xa0 shudras. The oppressed people who have come from the feet of God. Aishwaraya proved to the world that she is the smartest and beautiful when she won the Miss World title. Brahmins the most cruel race in the world could never digest it. When Aishwarya Rai joined movies the brahmin and Bania toilet papers like Times of India, Hindu and Indian Express were seething with jealousy. They made claims that she does not know any acting. They always sided with their jatwallah actress like the maharistrian brahmins Madhuri Dixit and Sonali Bendre.\n\n# The wily\xa0upper caste people in Bollywood tried to set up Aishwarya Rai with the upper caste wallahs. But our Shudra sister Aishwarya never relented. It was during this time when she was harassed by these papans that Salman Khan rescued her. Salman Khan being a muslim wanted to get married to Aishwarya Rai and save her from the oppressive Hindu caste system. A system which has crushed and oppressed our men and especially women. But the upper caste wallahs started spreading all kinds of rumors about Salman Khan. They called him a cocaine addict. These brahmins can go to any length. They will tell what suits their need. Finally they implicated Salman Khan in a fake accident case. They split these two people so that Aishwarya can stay in the evil Hindu caste system. This is what all these upper caste people have been doing to Dalits so that they can never escape from their tyranny.\n\n# After this incident they did not leave Aishwarya alone. They hatched a conspiracy in UP and got the manuwadi Amar Singh to get Aishwarya married to Abhishek Bachan, a half upper caste sikh and brahmin. They even made Aishwarya marry a banana plant before this marriage. How these evil people oppress us there is no end. Aishwarya now no longer identifies with her Dalit brethren. She has been swallowed up by this upper caste conspiracy.\n\n#'<br />Author: 'virat_pandit'<br />id: 'jksj2l'<br />Flair ::HighIQ: Randia Simulation</li>

And when it comes to "not killing the innocents",  all the non believers are considered to be the guilty i.e not innocent in the eyes of ola,  means you are marked for death.\nAnyways, if you do good to muslims,  and you feel lile " we friends now",  well muslims have been taught that non muslims/kaffirs are there to serve muslims. So your peacefull buddy won\'t flinch a bit in splitting your throat if he is asked to from his masters. \nBe wise, stay away from peacefuls and islam.'<br />Author: 'UnusualSandwich7'<br />id: 'jkq1ep'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihad</li>

<li>Title: "Don't let the degenerates drag us down"<br />Body: 'Whenever gullible and degenerate Hindus try to sabotage the Hindu society by claiming that women could roam topless and wear whatever they wanted in their "ancient India" based on some artistic and aesthetic sculptures, paintings, literature where the female form was depicted from the point of view of a private and secluded time (in contrast to such things being allowed in public), or when due to the behaviour of some ethnic groups in few parts of the subcontinent that allowed females exposing their private parts; then such Hindus should first be explained that Vedas and the scriptures are the मुख्य प्रमाण and what the Vedic Mantras say is law. Thereafter, the following Mantra by the Rishi Medatithi Kanva be used as evidence that Arya women are supposed to cover their bodies, in all ages, ancient or modern. \n\nअ॒धः प॑श्यस्व॒ मोपरि॑ संत॒रां पा॑द॒कौ ह॑र।\n\nमा ते॑ कशप्ल॒कौ दृ॑श॒न्स्त्री हि ब्र॒ह्मा ब॒भूवि॑थ॥ \n\nadhaḥ paśyasva mopari santarāṃ pādakau hara | \nmā te kaṣaplakau dṛśan strī hi brahmā babhūvitha || \n\nहे स्त्री! तू सदा नीचे देखा कर, ऊपर मत देख, तू पैरों को ठीक से एकत्र करते हुए चल, तेरे कशप्लक अर्थात दोनों स्तन, पीठ और पेट, नितम्भ, दोनों जाँघे, और दोनों पिंढ़ीलियां (घुटने और ऐड़ी के बीच का भाग) दिखाई न दे। क्योंकि स्त्री ब्रह्मा, निर्माणकर्त्री हुई है। \n\nThe Mantra clearly states that women should cover their body - breasts, back, stomach, waist, buttocks, private parts, thighs, and legs ( uptil the ankles). Additionally they should walk with grace and decency, and not in an attention seeking behaviour. They should gaze downwards (simply not glance or eye contact with other random men). All this because woman is a miniature aspect of Brahma the creator, and like him she has the power to create (give birth). If women become corrupt, the creation itself will be hampered and corrupted.

<li>Title: 'Posting a Gita verse day 8 (the last day).'<br />Body: '*Sanskrit*\n\n**सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज |**  \n**अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच: ||18. 66||**\n\n*sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja*  \n*ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣhayiṣhyāmi mā śhuchaḥ*\n\n*Hindi*\n\nधर्मों की सभी किस्मों को त्याग दें और बस मुझे अकेले आत्मसमर्पण करें। मैं तुम्हें सभी पापपूर्ण प्रतिक्रियाओं से मुक्त कर दूंगा; डरो मत। 18.66\n\n*English*\n\nAbandon all varieties of dharma (or religion) and simply surrender unto me alone. I shall liberate you from all sins; do not fear (18.66)\n\n*Commentary*\n\n**All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously—engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya** ***dharma*****, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle of** ***karm yog*****. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material** ***dharma*****. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle of** ***karm sanyās*****. Here, one may question that if we give up all our material** ***dharmas*** **will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.**\n\n**To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term** ***dharma*****. It comes from the root word** ***dhṛi*****, which means** ***dhāraṇ karane yogya*****, or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” There are actually two kinds of** ***dharmas*****—material** ***dharma*** **and spiritual** ***dharma*****. These two kinds of** ***dharma*** **are based upon two different understandings of the “self.” When we identify ourselves as the body, then our** ***dharma*** **is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodily** ***dharma*****. This is also called** ***apara dharma*** **or material** ***dharma*****. This includes the** ***dharma*** **as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of** ***varṇa*** **(social class) and** ***āśhram*** **(status in life). The soul’s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and only** ***dharma*** **becomes loving devotional service to God. This is also called** ***para dharma*** **or spiritual** ***dharma*****.**\n\n**If one leaves the material** ***dharma*** **it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material** ***dharma*** **and takes the shelter of spiritual** ***dharma*****, it is not a sin. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:**\n\n***devarṣhi-bhūtāpta-nṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājan***\n\n***sarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam*** **(11.5.41)\\[v37\\]**\n\n**This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts—to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. The** ***varṇāśhram*** **system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material** ***dharma*** **if we are properly situated in spiritual** ***dharma*****. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual** ***dharma*****. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:**\n\n***ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakān***\n\n***dharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ*** **(11.11.32) \\[v38\\]**\n\n**“I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily** ***dharma*** **in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best** ***sādhaks*****.” In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said:**\n\n***guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū, kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāū***\n\n***more sabahiñ eka tuma swāmī, dinabhandhu ura antarayamī*** **\\[v39\\]**\n\n**“O Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.” Similarly, Prahlad said:**\n\n***mātā nāsti pitā na ’sti na ’sti me swajano janaḥ*** **\\[v40\\]**  \n\n\n**“I do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).”**\n\n**In the** ***Bhagavad Gita*****, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to do** ***karm*****, i.e. his material** ***dharma*** **as a warrior (verse 2.31). But material** ***dharma*** **does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do** ***karm yog*****, i.e. his material** ***dharma*** **with the body and spiritual** ***dharma*** **with the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of** ***karm yog*** **forms the major portion of the** **Bhagavad Gita****. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice** ***karm sanyās*****, i.e. renounce all material** ***dharma*** **and simply adopt spiritual** ***dharma*****, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.**\n\nजय श्री कृष्णा\n\n जय श्री अर्जुन'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jjpp6g'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'I have seen many posts in this subreddit, showing how BJP is an exact replica of the Congress and is no different, here is a rebuttal to them, and yes I know that I will be downvoted into oblivion.'<br />Body: 'I would like to start-off my article by saying this:\n\nChanging the environment(The thought of the people) is a painfully slow process, which requires you to have patience.\n\nNowadays, I have seen many people, especially those who previously supported Modi, in particular, calling him, as Maulana Modi, to show how he, in disguise is an appeaser of Islam, and no different than the previous, Congress Party. In this article, I would like to talk about said people, by explaining how their claims are faulty, at best.\n\nNote : This will be divided into parts, as it is, then easier for\xa0 both me and you.\n\n\nPart 1 : The influence of Liberals/Liberalism around India\n\n\nI would say the influence of liberalism, has further increased in the past few decades, but the idea behind it has been present since 1947. The thought of liberalism which infected India included hating on Hinduism, not saying anything about minority religions and never at all talking how the religions of Islam and Christianity are like leeches to this nation, which is slowly sucking\xa0 the blood out of it. This was the nation that the BJP inherited in 2014, that is the reason why the government wasn’t able to introduce any key bills, addressing the issue of Hindu inferiority.\n\n\nPart 2 : The absolute hate against Hinduism, by Hindus themselves.\n\n\nThe hate present in Hindus against their own religion, what a typical subject if I were to say so myself, something that the liberals, used for their own advantage. However, many ask, what’s the reason behind it, before telling the reason I would like to give an example. Language, what language am I using at the moment, the language of our very own invaders, yes, of course I would love to use the language of our land, Sanskrit, but why am I not using it? It is because the government, never saw a reason to teach me in a language I would understand for Shiva’s Sake. This is what clearly proves the root cause, the root cause being the absolute disinterest of the post-independence government in culture, language and even basic education. This is what has led to the disinterest of the nations children in preserving their religion, or even show the world how valuable it can be to everybody.\n\n\nPart 3, and the final Part : Why did BJP, come to power anyway?\n\n\nThis is very much a debatable topic, so feel free to disagree. But, I think we can agree on one thing, that The BJP came to power as they promised vikas, and an end to corruption, for once and for all. Though religion may have been a contributor, I can confirm it wasn’t the main reason. I would say religion was bigger of a contributor, in the 2019, general election, as compared to the previous one. The book, Messiah Modi proves my point quite well, as to how an Indian citizen in India, before 2014 was derived from basic needs like healthcare, food and clean drinking water.\n\n\nEnding Remarks :\xa0\n\nIf you have read my point by point rebuttal well, and if, for a period of time, we consider it the truth. Then we can come to a conclusion, that the environment of India, pre-2014 was filled with self-loathers who loved seeing the country as a pile of filth, rather than loving it as their very own Mother, and in an environment filled with this much garbage, the fact that the BJP was able to do what they did, even a fraction of it is,\n\nB R E A T H T A K I N G to say the least. I am not a complete Bhakt of the Bharatiya Janta Dal, but I think one thing that we can all do is, appreciate the amount of Hindutva, BJP was able to fuel into us all, and criticize the party at,every one of its hick-ups, as we only want the best for the nation.\n\nJai Hind!\n\nVande Mataram!'<br />Author: 'Generocide'<br />id: 'jjjopd'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

So I took some time out of my day and a quick search will give you a plethora of articles calling it a disgrace to women. Reading through a few I understood that most if these articles are recycled and rely heavily upon western construct of feminism to dissect the script. Well, I'm not informed enough to have an opinion on whether it is indeed misogynistic or not(True Indology can help us with that), I just want to know if it truly exist within our society at this day of age.\n\nI asked women in my family if they have heard about Manusmriti and they had not. When I asked my grandfather, he did say he had heard about Manusmriti but had not read it. So this made me wonder, how much of our family dynamics is based on Manusmriti? The left wants to make it THE ABSOLUTE REASON for all bad things that happen to females in our country.

<li>Title: 'There is still some amount of values left in this country'<br />Body: "We all know that the mindless left always tries to pin things on brahminical patriarchy and systemic oppression. But I want to tell the bhratas and bhaginis a small story that is a clear cut counterexample to their nonsensical proposition.\n\nSo here it goes\n\nLast year my father visited  Multai (a small town in Madhya Pradesh) on some office work. The tapati river flows through the town and he went to the river bank to a take a dip and do sandhayavandana and on his way back he was clad in the traditional dhoti with vibhooti on his forehead and as he was walking towards the car a lot of people that were there on the riverbank started saying pranam panditji. And he said pranam back to them and went on his way to the office.\n\nNow the point I'd like to make is that if there is a rampant amount of oppression, will normal people say pranam obviously no. I'm not saying that we live in a utopian society but there some people in this great nation that do believe in sanatana dharma and when they say pranam they are not saluting a person but the paramatma within them. These kinds of gestures go a long way towards building communal harmony in our nation.\n\nThat being said have a nice day."<br />Author: 'sprx7767'<br />id: 'jjjab6'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha. BG 4.11\n\n*Commentary*\n\nHere, Lord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him. For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma—he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God’s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed. On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.\n\nShree Krishna uses the word *bhajāmi*, which means “to serve.” He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:\n\n*ekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāsmi te kape*\n\n*śheṣhasyehopakārāṇāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ* (Vālmīki Ramayan)\\[v14\\]\n\n“O Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.” In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.\n\n*If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead? He explains in the following verse.*'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jj0ct3'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

<li>Title: 'A dream of True Hindu Rashtra'<br />Body: "*A few words to clear it out: I'm not rightist or leftist in my political ideology and this post has nothing to do with politics. I posted here because I was skeptical about its reception on r\\[slash\\]india. I'll post there too but after seeing what reception I get here. Also be advised that this may seem pretty far fetched but I don't blame someone who is afraid of making bold imaginations.*\n\n**Main text:**\n\nI read and read and came to a conclusion. And that made a dream.\n\nI have a dream.\n\nFor centuries Hindus/Sanatanis have been [persecuted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus) and we allowed every other ethnicity and religion to either spread or take refuge. For centuries Hinduism was misinterpreted and distorted.\n\nI envision a nation, built on the Vedic Sanatani virtues and flourished with the modern philosophy. A nation where everyone is treated equal irrespective or caste, creed or religion. A nation which promotes development of the old Sanatani philosophies like they were into development through debates, discussions and research centuries ago. A nation which respects other religions and ideas. A nation which stands up tall for what is righteous, where the knowledge of a person is his social stature, where the pursuit of Gyan(Jnan) has the foremost importance and a nation where no Hindu or any other religion person shall feel intimidated again by any force.\n\nAfter the gap of millennia, it is the time we take up the development of our religion through the modern concept of science. There was a time when these things were the same, now one has lagged behind, it is our duty now to take the movement forward. The [various Hindu schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy#Classifications), the concepts in [Hindu Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy) are very rich but need new life.\n\nHence I envision a nation where Sanskrit education is given importance, government orders are required to be published in Sanskrit, govt promotes all the researches to also be published in Sanskrit. This vast knowledge creation in Sanskrit will move our religion forward, and give it a new life.\n\nAll this new knowledge generated through researches and discussions and debates in the various schools of Sciences, Engineering, Philosophy, Medicine, Law etc. will give rise to the *naveen-granth*s, they will give new life to our religion. Hinduism has always been known to be flexible and developed through the discussions and debates of Rishis and Munis, there is no supreme authority, there is no supreme deity, no higher or lower order among gods (after the Bhakti movement). Given this nature and that Hinduism was under continuous development even until recent (Buddha) times, it is only justified that we contribute to the Dharma and hence contribute to ourselves. Ours is a living religion which adjusts with changing times and which shows light even in the difficult days. Hence when the debates and discussions and experiments are stopped, the Sanatan Dharma is choked because it's breath is new ideas and reforms towards better tomorrow.\n\nThere is so much in those unturned Palm leaf manuscripts which we have ignored, there is so much in ourselves which we have ignored. This is the time that we strive for the future which should have been, a future which was lost until now.\n\nIndia needs to rewake as Bharat that it was supposed to be and live at it's full potential of economic, cultural and philosophical development. Bharat is the future, the *vishwaguru* we dreamt of.\n\n**Thank you for reading if you have read till now.**\n\nPlease feel free to ask or discuss something. I sincerely expect discussions strictly related to this topic. I have no hate or love for any religion/group/etc, Sanatan Dharma stands apart as a logical choice for me. And let me know your views about the same. I am okay with non-hateful political discussions. And apologies for spelling mistakes if any."<br />Author: 'MynkM'<br />id: 'jinh96'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li>

I might get downvoted to hell for commenting this here. But i really want people to know that these things hurt and we as a society need to change. \n\nThe mother who is embarrassed or disgusted with the thought of his son as  she got so influenced by overthinking mentality of feminism that she now see his son as a rapist, please don’t step outside of their house ever on streets. The sister who believes his brother needs to be home because she thinks women are oppressed by males, shouldn't walk outside on rainy days as Indra Dev is angry at them. The women who falsely accused their husbands for domestic violence, rape shouldn't ask for dowry as this could negatively impact their feminist agenda. Women who look at all men as an rapists in buses, on roads, at workplaces. Women who get together to make men uncomfortable with words and gestures. Women who mutilate a man’s dignity, his soul, his mind in the name of patriarchy, shouldn't pray Dev. Don't offer water to Surya Dev! Don’t light the diya. Don’t sing his hymns. Don’t fast on Mondays for better soulpartner. First learn to respect each and every men you come across, be it your father, your brother, your male friends, your husbands, your sons or any man that passes by you. \n\nI know this is not every woman, but as the saying goes gehu ke sath ghun bhi pista hai...we need to remove even that small minority of women who use men as tool and take advantage to grow as a society. This paradox must end! Till it doesn't, please dont bother Surya dev, treating him and only him with respect won't make him happy at you. Woh Dev hai, woh sab dekhte hai aur sab samajhte hai. Woh kanoon ki tarah andhe nahi hai, kanoon se bach jaoge par jab Shiv apne raudra roop mai ayenge tab kya karoge? \n\nI hope dear FEMINISTS over here will understand and next time they see something disrespectful happening to any men they'll raise they're voice and do what's right. Because even today people saw them using and taking advantage of helpless and falsely accused men just because they're women who can put charges and noone will question them but no one turning up for their help. NO ONE. Stepped up. We may not be strong enough to fight back yet but Bhagwan Shiv is and he'll not let them go. \n\nThank you for listening to my opinion, i really wanted to say something and i apologize if anything i said something that hurting any FEMINIST'S sentiments, it wasn't my intention but it needed to be said."<br />Author: 'JimmyHopkins06'<br />id: 'jgt85b'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

Of this, I am certain.**\n\nCommentary  ( by Shrila Prabhupada)\n\nThe [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) began with an inquiry of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sañjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kṛṣṇa was there. Kṛṣṇa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the master of renunciation.\n\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira. Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira’s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhiṣṭhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\n\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kṛṣṇa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: *man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.* One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa (*sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja*). The instructions of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the *Gītā* is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFrom [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kṛṣṇa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/)*.* The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nAnother feature of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. If one understands Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kṛṣṇa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\nIn [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and any other transcendental conception – exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness and difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of Kṛṣṇa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency\n\nSource for commentary-.[https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/78/](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/78/)\n\nSource for translation is from Chinmmayamission translation.\n\n  \n\n\n###'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jfy0qd'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li>

And why tf they think that hindu men are not into the game of romance while buslim bois steal all the girls. I'm from Jaipur, and a lot of buslim guys I've seen are creepy, desperate with *jhaat ke baal* on their face. Most of my hindu friends are tall, good looking, civilized and have a good sense of humour. They've been in relationship with beautiful women.\n\nI'm sure the guy who made that post (and people who agreed with him) have fallen into the trap of *The number 23* i.e. you only see what's in your head, and ignore everything around it because that doesn't prove what you want to prove.\n\nI've seen conservatives, fuck bois and long term lovers in both hindus and buslims.\n\nThat post made all of us look like insecure desperate losers of society who can't score women.\n\nAnd stop assuming that women are stupid enough to fall in the trap of love jihad. The genuine cases of LJ you see are actually negligible compared to the number of buslims trying to trap hindu women everyday. Ask any adult girl, she'll tell you how many buslims she have rejected. Women are good at reading intentions, you can't generalize millions of women based on few thousand incidents."<br />Author: 'he_depressed'<br />id: 'jfm4y6'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li>

Now you might have heard of this thing somewhere along that "you dont get to do a pilgrimage unless you get a call from Gods". Like Veshno devi yarta, Amarnath yarta, Shrihand Mahadave yarta and so one (counting char dham too). As they say "Jab tak bulaava na aaye, darshan nahin hote" \n\nI am a fairly rational one but here is the thing. I had a big project from office of which i was an imp part and i did my part back in August. But i was was the ONLY one who got to do his part back in August. Rest of the team did and project was presented EXACTLY during the dates i was on yatra. On the top of that, the plan for yatra was made so suddenly that we planned and left for it within 48 hrs. Now coz i am on work from home so negligible work on my part i was able to do on the go here and there. But this got me thinking if it wasnt some pre destined stars that pre defined my journey.\n\nJust wanted to hear your thoughts on this.\n\nPS: Yamuna mayyia, Ganga mayyia, Bhole Naath aur Hari Bhagwan ka aashirwad le ke aaya main Sub ke liye 🙏'<br />Author: 'Eric_Cartman-_-'<br />id: 'jffutj'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li>

<li>Title: 'What are you Indians talking about? Like, where do you come up with this shit?'<br />Body: 'Why are Indians saying that there have been "clashes between Army and Police". This is so untrue.\n\nHere\'s what actually happened: PML(N) supporters were protesting in Karachi lead by Mariyam Nawaz and his husband Safdar. The stormed Quaid e Azam\'s Tomb and raised slogans and protested inside the tomb. This is prohibited by law. The next day, Safdar was arrested as he was the one raising slogans.\n\nThis was warranted and constitutional.\n\nNow the PPP which has Govt in Karachi is in alliance with PML(N) and they couldn\'t afford the arrest of one of their alllied party\'s senior members.\n\nThey\'re saying that someone forced the IG of Sindh Police to sign the arrest warrant of Safdar.\nThey\'re implying that it was Rangers from a specific sector. This accusation is highly improbable as that sector of Karachi Rangers has been disbanded.\n\nPPP leader Bilawal called a press conference and asked the Army Chief to launch an inquiry by the Army.\n\nArmy Chief immediately called an inquiry and later called Bilawal.\n\nThere have been no clashes. Not even civil clashes.\n\nEverything\'s like it always has been.\n\nWhat I don\'t understand is why you people watch a few minutes of your idiotic media and then go on social media pretending to know shit.\n\nLike, a verified twitter account, @ppatel. I really wanna know what that guy is smoking.\nAnd the sad thing is most of your Internet Warriors are thinking this. \n\nKarachi just like it was a few months ago. Though not like a decade ago. When you\'d fear for your life everytime you went out. And then the Rangers came. \n\nWhy do you guys think you know ANYTHING just by watching your room temperature IQ media?\n\nSometimes I pity you guys over this. \n\nI wonder, what\'s worse?
