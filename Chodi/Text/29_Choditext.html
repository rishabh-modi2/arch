A lot of people are sharing the screenshot of the tweet by Israel where Israeli PM Office thanked various nations but not India. And, those people are claiming that Israel deceived India. But, its not the truth. Indian Government have never supported Israel openly. As Israel is gradually taking the land of Palestine, if India will support Israel openly then Pakistan &amp; China would get some lead to claim in the UN that India supports capturing land and that would harm India in the cases of Aksai Chin &amp; POK. Israel do know that India &amp; Indian government do support Israel but not mentioning publicly as it would harm India in other ways.

Author recounts contemporary political history of India with the help of his personal life journey. He analyses some seemingly interesting questions like ‚ÄúWhy Hindutva as an ideology is no longer anathema and what brought about this change?‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor what reason did a country that was governed for quite a long time by individuals embracing Nehruvian secularism unexpectedly started to line up with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)?‚Äù\n\nIn the first two chapters, he describes  his childhood and explains how his family brought him up as a Congressi Hindu, i.e. Congress supporters who were not very assertive about their identity as Hindus. He explains why most of the Hindus preferred the Congress party after Independence. The Congress party was able to send different messages to different communities without sounding incoherent. However, such a strategy included encouragement of anti-Hindu leftist intelligentsia in academic circles and media. So a Congressi Hindus lived a blissful life while their cultural heritage was being silently annihilated in significant spaces like media and the academicia.\n\nIn later chapters, the author being journalist also talks about the bias in the mainstream news media of India. He explains how the mainstream media shamelessly make things up for sensational headlines, resorts to outright lying to make a more dramatic story and finds no dishonour in publishing a partially and/or misreported narrative and labels it as ‚Äúresponsible journalism‚Äù. This shows how mainstream media is biased not just on political leanings but going so far as partially report of misreport news. \n\nMany may relate to this title of book even without even reading this book and I am one such person. It is without a doubt the journey of numerous Indians transformation into a vocal Hindu, with the activities of common Indian state, pseudo-liberal media and the colonized establishment giving the catalytic impact. I have been called a ‚ÄúSanghi‚Äù, for simply voicing my support for a party that I truly believe has done some good work. At first I got offended, but eventually when I found out that left keeps labeling people to avoid debates and to claim moral superiority I have started accepting those labels as badges of honour. So if I am a ‚ÄúSanghi who never went to a shakha‚Äù today it is because of liberals, it is because of their fragmented liberalism that has no room for anyone who doesn‚Äôt have exactly the same views, it is because of their cancel culture, which paints every BJP voter and Modi fan as a bigot. Though the foundation and timeline may vary, but the destination is same.'<br />Author: 'Im_impossible'<br />id: 'ndont4'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Ye ek rant he samajh lo!'<br />Body: 'Israel üáÆüá± ko support dikhana ek cringe hai ye ek naya fad shuru kia hai kuch logon ne.\n\nJab humare swadesh mein vocal support dikhane ka ek tareeka hai, jo shayad he koi aur desh ke paas hoga, aise mein peeche na hatiye.\n\nYe jo log cringe bolke ye fad faila rahe hai ye log yehi chahte hai ki aapka opinion sway kiya jaaye. \n\nKya aap apna opinion inn logon ke kehne par change karne walon mein se ho? \n\nMain bas yahaan ke har ek member ko yehi kehna chahunga jo dusre side ke hai they\'re leaving no stones unturned so why should we! \n\nTo aap kyun "woke bann rahe ho" kisi ke opinion se. \n\nIsrael ke paas sab kuch hai, ab jab unko dikh raha hai ki poori duniya unke against hai, unn sab ke beech mein humari Hindu populace hai jo unke liye stand le rahi hai.

I am probably going to hurt a lot of feelings, but I recommend you at least give it a read and we can have a healthy debate as no one is absolutely right. I also plan to continue this format as I find more topics to talk about.  \nBefore I start, I will tell people not to stop their resistances just because my arguments are logical, as you never truly know what the future will be like so never stop doing what is better for yourself and your community. Logic does not equal to being correct, this is a common pitfall RW people usually fall into when debating with LW. Leftist ideologies like Marxism, Communism, and Socialism usually make perfect logical sense but they have proven to be complete failures in practice. Another darker example would be incest, ‚Äúincest is wrong because the offspring will be genetically twisted and will live a painful life, but if you use contraceptives, then there is no such problem.‚Äù Although this entire statement makes perfect logical sense, we all know it is morally wrong and probably cringed a little inside.\n\nAlso I am not some prediction engine or some sort of prophet. I may turn out to be incredibly wrong, but history has a tendency to repeat itself and humans have a tendency to be very emotional so I am pretty confident in my predictions.\n\nToday‚Äôs topic is about Hindutva and/or Hinduism, whatever you may prefer to call it, being on the verge of extinction, and that the only way to save it is via Hindu nationalism. This holds some truth, but not in the way people think right now and even then something must go horrendously wrong for Hindutva to go extinct. People see the surface and immediately assume it‚Äôs Islam that is going to be the end of Santana Dharma, this just isn‚Äôt feasible, even if, God forbid, India as a nation ends up breaking. Human psychology is the reason. I will borrow an example to explain. You know how some colonies have a single street food vendor who only sells one item, but people have to go there, because if you go to the other colony, you are a traitor; this is Islam. Whereas Hindutva is like an all you can eat buffet, where once you look at the menu you start to wonder how can the restaurant even have this many dishes. Point being, Hindutva can fit any kind of person with any kind of ideology into itself and still be cohesive with itself. While other religions need coercion or force to convert people, Hindutva is a self driving force, especially as there is an ideological vacuum forming in South East Asia. It is also the least repressive of the religions. People may talk about caste based discrimination, but they ignore the fact that it is in fact not supported by any sacred texts and even Ramayana tells the inspiring tale of not dwelling in caste and treating everyone equally. Now the caste system has been largely ignored in the modern India and is only surviving because of reservations, this isn‚Äôt just an irony bomb, it‚Äôs an entire nuke.\n\nPeople might say, what happened in Kashmir, Kerala and now in WB is proof that I am wrong. But you have to understand, this just isn‚Äôt sustainable in the long run. Either we will go through riots or worse a civil war if Muslims really start testing Hindus, and no amount of media whitewashing will stop this from coming down. The other more likely scenario is that India will see an economic boom before that period of brutal civil unrest begins and the whole of Indian Subcontinent, that being India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma will just get sucked into India‚Äôs mammoth political and economical orbit. The situation will most likely turn into how USA and Canada were bitter enemies but now have the biggest unguarded border between them. This won‚Äôt be the ever elusive ‚ÄòAkhand Bharat‚Äô that some people hope for, but it will be a close second. This point is largely ignored by both the defenders of Islam and people who are angry at them. People don‚Äôt realize that most Muslim pushback against India and Hindus in the world is just information warfare from Pakistan‚Äôs side and they‚Äôve been at it since 47, they have always painted Hindus as some sort of fascistic religion hell bent on killing Muslims. This mainly stems from the Army having control over their economy and not wanting to let go. If they have no ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô they can‚Äôt justify siphoning state funds for Army and also militant groups. This is why they fund separatists of India, export their ‚Äòintellectuals‚Äô to the developed world to gain influence. This however is also not sustainable. Indian growth would mean less and less people would want to separate. Imagine a Khalistan completely land locked, with all its rivers flowing in from India, it would be an economical suicide. And as big daddy China‚Äôs growth is halting and Pakistan has distanced itself more and more from USA, there really isn‚Äôt anyone that can bolster it against India which has all the moral and legal high-ground, as recent surveys have shown that perception of India is only becoming better in the developed world. India has seen democratic rule since independence while Pakistan is often taken over by Army. I expect Pakistan to just off itself like the collapse of the USSR in the next few decades, or reform heavily in favor of democracy. Then there will be a significant portion of Indian haters inside India suddenly left with a hard choice; accept the truth as a guest in your house, or ignore its existence and watch it burn the whole place down. There is a darker ending to this, which I may talk about at a later date.  \nHowever there is another side to this, corrupting Hindutva from inside to the point it can't be recognized anymore where even if people identify themselves as Hindu, they really aren‚Äôt. It is not the external threat, it is the rats that we ourselves let in.  \nCults like Radha Soami, these are in essence, people that have managed to convince a handful of people that they are messengers of God or something. This group claims that Ganga is not a holy river, it is just any river. There is no backlash against it as they do not allow recordings of any kind as such only brainwashed individuals have heard most of it, their preachers can just keep making up whatever they want. This cult only came into existence in the 19th century.\n\nAnother cult is Brahma Kumaris, this one is even more outrageous as it‚Äôs founder only founded this in 1936, and there are pictures of him in western style suit, far from any spiritual person. This cult claims that Ramayana is fake and Ram is fictional.\n\nIn fact this is essentially how Sai was forced into Hindu Religion. This is basically guerilla warfare on an entire religion.  \nThis argument however does disservice to people asking and working for strengthened nationalism on the back of a common ideology, in this case Hindu Nationalism. Depending on how you think, you might or might not like my take. Hindu Nationalism will slowly die down, whereas Indian nationalism will rise, again, similar to how pre civil war era USA was very divided in ideologies but later assumed a common patriotism to USA even if they disagreed on ideologies. I just hope our economic stability comes early and we do not require a civil war for the Indian nationalism to manifest.\n\nI want to end it by saying it again, no predictions are correct, people far more qualified than me have made predictions that have gone horribly wrong. All of European powers prior to World War 1 thought they would win the war in a matter of months. As such I will still encourage people to keep doing what they are doing, everyone has the right to fight for their ideology, all India needs is self sufficiency and a little bit of time to become the undisputed hegemon of this part of the continent."<br />Author: 'IISCP4999II'<br />id: 'ndmkah'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Ab ye toh hadd hi ho gayi!!!'<br />Body: 'Police arrested 25 people for placing the posters and some of them were labourers being paid to do that .\n\nGovernment ne Kaya humko chutiya samaj rakha hai Kaya ki woh kuch bhi karti rahe aur hum aankh band Kare rahe .'<br />Author: 'proudHINDU2000'<br />id: 'ndmh3w'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Jhanda nahi hua toh kya hua?

Larger context of Hindu Civilization &amp; Dharma in which current battle is playing out.

Pinpointing locations of those who are masterminds is a difficult task. Eliminating them is even more difficult as none of them will actually be in israel.

There are very high chances that agents will be ambushed due to the predictability issues\n3) terror outfits aren't like nuclear programmes. Eliminating one of the top scientists will halt the nuclear programme buying enough time but eliminating top leaders of terror outfit won't do so because there are thousands of people in islamic nations who can fill the place of terrorist outfit leaders however only a few can fit the place of scientists\n4) the moment any of the top leaders of hamas is eliminated, hamas will increase the rate of firing of missiles on Israel in order to pressurise them.

PART 2: THE REAL STORY OF THE ISLAMIC RULE THAT WE WERE NEVER TOLD'<br />Body: 'Imagine a country called X, a country with a\xa0continuous lineage of 5000 years. And it was filthy rich. In fact it was richer than the rest of the world, at that time, put together. And everyone knew that. For the ancient non X, earth dwellers who were not cavemen, X was not a country but an entire freakin continent. And their papyrus scrolls showed it that way.\n\n[ Rest of Asia, You are not worthy to be on our precious papyrus](https://preview.redd.it/b47x1x8qi8z61.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2bfb040710ca959a6b7e9587add0345a98a78ad)\n\n \n\nAnyways, as what happens to a rich house in a poor locality, all the have-nots in the world, realizing how much wealth was there for the taking, converged onto X. They came in droves, time after time, \xa0to help themselves to the\xa0unlimited\xa0booty on offer. And after a while (seventeen times), someone just said ‚Äòscrew it, let‚Äôs settle down in India once and for all‚Äô. And in the process they claimed X theirs, by birth.\n\nIt was as if a huge guy walked into a house, sat on its sofa, took out a cigar, and said the house belongs to not only him, but his ancestors as well. Without even as much as looking at the original inhabitants. What would or could the poor souls do?\n\n[ This is my house now amigo...](https://preview.redd.it/5uztv77cj8z61.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d716576eb491489a43dfd03da1062500251e46)\n\nWhatever they did, it will still be better than what our historians have done.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt guessed it by now, Country X is India and the huge guy is an allegory for the various Islamic hordes from regions as far as Mongolia to modern day Kazakhstan. So instead of telling our children who this guy really was and what he really did, we have deified and honoured this invading band of tribes. In fact most of our medieval history is dedicated to these bunch of rear-cracks, for reasons I don‚Äôt know. And as our historians lack ‚Äôround objects below the abdomen‚Äô to present the true picture of the Islamic rule, let me do the job for them.\n\nIndia‚Äôs first encounter with an Islamic ruler started when a douchebag named Mahmud Of Ghazni landed here in 1004 AD. You might have come across this guy in your textbook as the dude who raided the Somnath Temple, a little over 17 times. However, what our historians have neglected to mention is that this guy did not just raid the Somnath temple, he demolished it every time he came. In fact at one point of time he was so pissed off by our\xa0resilience, he massacred about 50,000 Somnath inhabitants, razed the temple to the ground again, smashed the ShivLing made from solid gold into tiny little pieces and then embedded them in the steps of the Jama Masjid back in his home town of Ghazni, so that the people could step on it while [going to pray.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_of_Ghazni#Destruction_of_Somnath_Temple)\n\nHad there been a thesaurus.com in the 1st century AD, the first entry for the words evil, horror, despicable and other similar words, would have been Mahmud Of Ghazni.\n\n[ If evil had a face, This had to be it](https://preview.redd.it/y6jbu42mj8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae216f081b4e7fcbb9b336adead3855f281dc0c9)\n\nAnd if\xa0obliterating\xa0one temple was not enough, he also destroyed the temples in Ujjain and Dwarka and sacked them. In fact, in all his invasions he never tried to consolidate his rule in India. All he wanted to do was loot and kill. To sum it up, He came, he saw, he destroyed, he looted, unleashed an evil laugh and went back. In Fact he was so evil and caused so much damage to our country, that our friends in Pakistan named a freakin missile after him, just to harness his India destruction potential.\n\n And that he was evil is not something that is being made up. This was what his own biographer had to say\n\n&gt;‚ÄúIn the interest of his successors he constructed, in order to weaken the Indian frontier, those roads on which afterwards his son Mahmud marched into India during a period of thirty years and more. God be merciful to both father and son! Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country, and performed there wonderful exploits, by which the Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people. Their scattered remains cherish, of course, the most inveterate aversion towards all Muslims. This is the reason, too, why Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares, and other places. And there the antagonism between them and all foreigners receives more and more nourishment both from political and religious sources.‚Äù \xa0[Source.](http://books.google.com/books?id=9-yUPk_Q5VsC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) \n\nThe biographer was executed.\n\nThis guy, who will be right up there, in any ‚Äòtop 10 evil men of the century‚Äô list, should have been\xa0portrayed\xa0as the evil version of \xa0the evil Gabbar Singh, a bandit and a mass murderer. Instead our historians admire his\xa0persistence and\xa0perseverance. And then, we also name a freakin movie after him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jb1fgu18l8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f59c717304c57d1695bfeae09b2c27780c0bc8\n\nIt is like an MBA book, citing the Nazi holocaust as a case study for logistics management.\xa0Perseverance, you must be kidding me.\n\nSacking and razing the great Indian temples was not the only contribution made by Mahmud of Ghazni to our history. He was the guy, who basically showed the desolate regions in central Asia that the unlimited Indian wealth was there for the taking and you just had to turn up. He was the guy who laid the foundation of Islamic rule in India for the next 700 odd years.\n\nAnd we admire his\xa0perseverance.\n\nAfter Mahmud of Ghazni, all the emperors in the central Asian wilderness were itching to go to India for its limitless wealth. But it took them a 100 years to actually gather up enough men and material to mount another invasion, simultaneously giving Indians time to replenish their treasure stocks. While we were coming back to terms with life, Mahumd Of Ghazni married 9 wives, sired 56 legitimate children and got bitten by a female anophles mosquito and died of Malaria (Never underestimate an angry mosquito). After long years of internal squabbling, Mohammad Ghori (Ghauri) finally ascended the throne of Ghazni in A.D 1178. And promptly attacked India in A.D 1191.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gwgrtwunl8z61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836ab3cc74bfe67e78f35b5d349813ba28a908ca)\n\nOpposing him this time was the Rajput king, Prithviraj Chauhan, who famously [eloped with Princess Samyukta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyukta), right under the nose of her father, Raja Jaichand of Kanauj. \xa0Mohammad Ghauri, thanks to the lessons learnt from ~~Aamir Khan~~ Mahmud of Ghazni, was so overconfident about his impending victory that he was already planning the after victory pillage party when he came face to face with ‚ÄòMy profession, hobby, passion and happiness is war‚Äô Prithviraj Chauhan, at Tarain, some 150 Kms from New Delhi.\n\nHe got his ass kicked.\n\nHe was not just defeated, he was totally routed. In fact, he got his backside kicked so badly, that he was captured by Prithviraj Chauhan whom he begged for mercy. And much to the consternation and objections of his courtiers, (who wanted to chop Ghori‚Äôs head off), Chauhan magnanimously spared Ghori‚Äôs life and let him return back to Ghazni with his head on his shoulders.\n\nBut Ghori, like all other ungrateful wretches, attacked Chauhan again in A.D 1194.\n\nUsing some\xa0skulduggery\xa0and deceit, he somehow managed to defeat Chauhan and his army and captured him alive. He promptly entered Delhi and massacred some 100,000 people combining it with some general pillage and loot thrown in. He then went back to Ghazni, where he executed the man who spared his life three years before. Chauhan was killed with the full knowledge that he had signed his own death warrant.\n\nSo according to our Historians\n\nPrithviraj Chauhan, a merciful king, who in a total departure from the general rules of warfare, spares the life of his adversary and under whose aegis, the famous sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chisti was able to establish the famous Ajmer Dargah, is not worthy enough to be mentioned.\n\nWhile, Mohammad Ghori, an ungrateful wretch, killer of a man who spared his life and 100,000 more, gets more space than [Emperor Harsha and Palas ](https://kaipullai.com/2011/09/12/the-greatest-heist-in-indian-history-how-our-history-was-changed-and-we-didnt-even-notice-part-1the-lost-eon-6th-century-b-c-to-1174-a-d/)put together. You think this is travesty, well it only gets worse from here. And yes, Pakistan named another missile after this guy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x03c41tam8z61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc3e1d959e5a59a1b6fa4b4c844b9eeada226d6\n\nMohammad Ghori, did not have any heir, so he basically carved up his empire among his different Turkish Slaves, with Qutub-ud-Din aibak given the kingdom of India or Hindustan as it was known then. And that started the Delhi Sultanate. Here is a list of the other Delhi Sultanate Rulers\n\nQutub-Ud-Din Aibak: 1206-1210\n\nIltutmish: 1210-1236\n\nRazia Sultana: 1236-1240 (Murdered in 1240 because she refused to wear a veil, was secular, tried to appoint a Hindu to an important position and had a relationship with an Abyssinian slave. Resurrected and murdered again by Hema Malini in 1983)\n\nBalban: 1246-1290\n\n**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî--End of the Slave Dynasty‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-**\n\n1290-1320 Alauddin Khilji : Was probably the best of the Sultanate kings. No religious porgorms were reported, and there were no widespread massacres in the name of religion. He was also known to restore a defeated king to kingship in exchange for tribute and gold.\n\nHowever, his general, a eunuch named Malik Kafur, a Rajput who converted to Islam, marched upto Tanjore in the south for some plunder. He negotiated in such a way that he did not have to fight a single battle till he reached his destination. He/She went south as far as Tanjore, desecrating and sacking temples in Srirangam, Madurai and Chidambaram and taking their solid gold idols away, which was his intention. However, it must be said that unlike the Mahmud of Ghazni, nothing was demolished and all the looting happened without the usual accompanying massacres.\n\nIt is said that when Kafur returned to New Delhi, he/she returned with 612 Elephants, Twenty Thousand Horses, 96,000 Thousand Nams (Approximately 241 Tonnes) of Gold and the usual countless boxes of jewels and pearls.\n\nAnd an eunuch in Delhi was never insulted after that.\n\nThis was about the last time, there was a sort-of benevolent\xa0Delhi Sultan, as most of the time, the term benovelent Delhi Sultan was an oxymoron. Also please remember Alauddin Khalji, for he has a role later on.\n\n1320-1413 ‚Äî The Tughlughs: World Famous\n\n1414-1451 ‚Äî The Sayyidis: Another gang\n\n1451- 1526 ‚Äî- The Lodis: The Last of the Sultans.\n\n**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-End of the Delhi Sultanate‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-**\n\n(The only reason why there is a description for Alauddin Khilji is that, he was the only one who was the chip off the block. The rest were almost similar in nature and evilness. To know more about the others, Please read Mahmud Of Ghazni, do a Ctrl C and a Ctrl V)\n\nWith all these crackpots, (yes Mohammad Tughlugh included) the Delhi sultanate lumbered along for 300 years, with different kings coming, killing and naming different areas in today‚Äôs Delhi (Ferozshah Kotla and Tughlaghabad, after Feroz Shah Tughlagh, Lodi Gardens after Ibrahim Lodi and so on) after them and then mostly, getting killed.\n\nI can go on and on about the not-so-nice details that our historians have skipped in this era, for reasons best known to them, but won‚Äôt for reasons of brevity. Please read [this book](http://www.flipkart.com/books/0007307756?pid=5kw3ffzwme&amp;_l=CJHVEqJO3veuHytbACc9dw--&amp;_r=QSau5TU7Qg0WHZW0EK5Z_Q--&amp;ref=f8e862a4-e58a-4f37-a249-661718067d0f)\xa0or [visit this website](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/irin/genocide.html), if you want to know more about this period. \xa0However, I will point some of the really big omissions.\n\nQutub-Ud-Din Aibak is described by the Indian historians as a slave who worked up to be the king. However, he is famous because of of the eponymous ‚ÄòQutub Minar‚Äô in New Delhi. Our historians lavish some\xa0unnecessary\xa0praise for what is at best a tall building, shaped like a particular part of the male anatomy.\n\n[ Big Deal](https://preview.redd.it/yahq8cn3n8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a59fd65e592db996cb1d476665020372dab2bac0)\n\nThis is what the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) plate at the minar says about this totally pointless tower.\n\n&gt;‚ÄòIt is the perfect example of \xa0a minar known to exist anywhere in the world. The [variegated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variegation) plan of its three lower stories the projecting balconies with stalactite pendentive brackets and some more mumbo jumbo.‚Äô\xa0\n\nHowever, what our eminent historians have apparently forgotten to mention or deliberately ignored is, that[ 27 temples were utterly destroyed](http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/kutub_oak.html) and the stones from those very temples were used to build this tower. \xa0And the builders were bloody proud of this fact.\xa0So proud, that Aibak and his successors had the gall to inscribe it on the eastern gate of the Qutub complex.\n\n27 temples destroyed for building this ‚Äòthing‚Äô and all our historians do is praise its variegated, pendentic brackets.  \n\n\n&gt;Just another thought, isn‚Äôt it ironic that most of the areas in our national capital are named after invaders, temple destroyers and who imposed taxes on poor innocents who just happened to be non-Muslims? I doubt any other nation on this planet honours their destroyers in this manner. (America even changed it‚Äôs metric system to wash itself off the British influence). Most importantly, nothing is named after the ones who actually did a lot of good for our country.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate, with the exception of Razia Sultana, Balban and Alauddin Khilji, \xa0actually was nothing more than a bunch religious fanatics, who rose to power almost miraculously and then somehow sustained it. However, whatever they did pales in comparison to who followed them, The Mughals.\n\nThe name Mughal itself is quite an accident. Genghis Khan, in his many conquests across the length of world, had some fun when he was doing his stuff in Central Asia. The result was a awkward hybrid between Mongol and Persian, which resulted in the name Moghul, which became Mughal. Genghis Khan, gave these guys the right to rule as long as they recognized the superiority of the Khan. All was well, until Genghis Khan died.\n\nKingdoms those days, especially the central asian ones, were not entirely unlike a bunch of kids in the first standard. Totally quiet till you have a teacher in a class, only to explode the moment teacher leaves. The only difference was, these guys had swords, spears and cannons to settle their disputes.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/954q5mgvn8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2936f63735ee8bf1e9b526323c26a07a169ce74)\n\nSo amid all the bloodshed and anarchy, there rose a warrior who united them all. And he was lame and he looked like the illegitimate child of the ugliest ogre.\n\n[ This was apparently his best pic](https://preview.redd.it/t4hit5d6o8z61.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b264fcdd56680acf9d26352b2ad122a18b8998)\n\nSo lame guy, kills everyone else, captures the capital city of Samarkand and declares himself king. And then attacks, you guessed it right, India.\n\nAttacking and plundering India was like a high point in a Mongol‚Äôs life, something you had to do to prove to rest of the world that you were a man. Mongols, before Timur, \xa0repeatedly attacked India, and once almost defeated the then emperor Alauddin Khilji. Which was when Khilji decided that shit had really hit the fan. So the next time Mongols came, he sent the now legendary Malik Kafur after them, who annihilated them in open battle. And just to drive home the message, Khilji had all the prisoners (some 10,000 dudes) trampled by elephants, their heads cut off and displayed as scarecrows outside his fort in Siri.\n\nThe Mongols did not come back.\n\nTill Timur the Lame.\n\nWhen Timur the lame, attacked India in A.D 1398, the Delhi Sultanate was in a total state of anarchy. So he basically had a free pass. Brushing aside whatever little resistance he faced, he got busy doing what was considered his dynasty‚Äôs expertise.\n\n[ There are a 100,000 people in this stadium](https://preview.redd.it/h067j9v3p8z61.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515485c316fba7f0f20b958cb77c0a3e88413228)\n\nJust imagine, every single human in this crowd, speared through the chest, decapacitated and their heads stacked up in a Jenga like formation outside a city. Which was exactly what Timur the lame did.\n\nTo discourage resistance or mebbe he just got a kick out of it, Timur killed 100,000 ‚Äònon Musulm√°ns‚Äô, cut their heads off and built a[ skull-wall outside Delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur#Indian_campaign). When the terrified Dilliwallahs capitulated, he walked in and killed the rest to the last man, woman and child, excepting the quarter which had ‚Äòsaiyids, the ‚Äòulam√°, and other Musulm√°n‚Äô and went back with another trove of cash, gold and jewels. He also apparently sent out an order that, every soldier in his looting column had to return with at least two severed human heads to show him.\n\nAnd, how did Timur justify these dastardly acts of violence: ‚ÄòMuslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its\xa0Hindu\xa0subjects‚Äô. Yes, too tolerant.\n\n[ Built entirely using Indian money](https://preview.redd.it/833e6uw3q8z61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520a31d16b7b5264708978643f57a97bca470268)\n\nAnd the first emperor of the much celebrated by our historians, Mughal Dynasty, Emperor ·∫íahƒ´r ad-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Babar was the great great grandson of this murdering wretch. Yes, a direct\xa0descendant.\n\nSo now you know why the ancestry of the great Mughal empire has been\xa0conveniently\xa0hidden from us for so long. You don‚Äôt want to tell the people that the empire we celebrate the most, and dedicate the maximum space in out history books to, is directly responsible for the most destructive religious and ethnic cleansing ever in Indian history. And as portrayed in our textbooks, Babar did not land in India because he was a great visionary or an emperor. He came here simply because he had nowhere else to go.\n\nHe tried to capture Samarkand, in modern day Uzbekistan where he got his ass kicked by the Uzbek king Shaibani Khan. Reduced to a wandering nomad but with the support from the then Persian king, he landed at the gates of India, where to his luck the Lodi‚Äôs were in strife. And before you know it, he was the ruler of India. And he had the temerity to claim the throne of India, ‚Äòas his right‚Äô.\n\n*Processing img ec6w4b2kq8z61...*\n\nBabur set about expanding his kingdom, defeating the Rajputs, capturing the fort of Chittor and also is credited with the world‚Äôs first execution by firing squad, when he ordered his musketmen to kill the 100000 prisoners of war. His rule was in no way better than the others, as Indian historians potray. He defaced Jain temples in Rajashtan, simply because he could not stand them. And of course he demolished the most famous temple of all, the [temple at Ayodhya](http://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm)\xa0to build the \xa0eponymous mosque, the Babri Masjid. So Babar is directly responsible for the communal tension in our country today. And our historians, lead by the esteemed Ms Romila Thapar continue to deny this, in face of clear evidence, and as a result we are kept completely in the dark.\n\n&gt;On a related note, it is deeply distressing that the most comprehensive work detailing the wanton destruction of temples and massacres perpetrated by the sultanate and their successors comes from a Belgian Historian, [Koenraad Elst.](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/index.html)\xa0Yes a Belgian\n\nThe next part \xa0will delve further into the excesses and the occassional benovelence of the Mughals.\n\nPersonally, I want these not-so-good things to be expunged from our History for obvious reasons. But when I read successive chapters in Indian history textbooks dedicated to the glorification of these very emperors, I felt I had to bring out the real story. I apologize if I hurt some sentiments, It is not my intention. But I ask\n\n1. Why glorify the Mughal rule, when it was their ancestor who was the architect of one of the most destructive religious pogroms?\n2. If you are mentioning Ghazni‚Äôs 17 incursions and describe him as persistent, why not tell what he actually did those 17 times?\n3. When you credit the Delhi Sultanate for bringing stability to India, why hide their less glorious stuff like forced conversions, wanton looting and *‚Äòjiziya‚Äô*?\n4. Most importantly, Why do you think our countrymen cannot handle the truth?\n\nRest in the next post.'<br />Author: 'SHIVANSH_RTX'<br />id: 'nctncf'<br />Flair :Indian History &amp; Culture :H:</li><li>Title: 'A short rant but pls do read'<br />Body: 'The Hindu newspaper published an article calling tejasvi surya and hindutva a virus &amp; gave seemingly baseless claims but there is no outrage about this.

You have honestly represented what is being taught at the modern schools and college courses and popular discourses. However, here are some pertinent points to be considered- \nLet us understand that discrediting the ageold religious heritage for its unparallelled nourishment and promotion of various knowledge systems including the sciences, architecture and fine arts at all times, is like discrediting our parents or foster parents for our very existence. But we are misled to do so. \nThere are lots of literary, monumental, numismatic evidences and numerous living traditions which speak loud facts and explain the symbolisms and concepts behind our structures. But they have no representation at all in Indian education. They are either kept concealed or trivialized as primitive and irrelevant or else shown as ‚Äònothing to do with‚Äô our religion or culture. It is not surprising therefore that we are made to believe that architectural structures have ‚Äònothing to do with our culture‚Äô, while actually our architectural structures are the very personifications of our rich religio-cultural symbolisms! No single treatise shastra begins without acknowledging the deity, rishi and parampara that first conceived it. Every shastra or knowledge tradition of India has survived for ages, because they were nourished, patronized and preserved by the great temples, monasteries and Kingships with utmost love and care and even through sacrifices.  \nThe architecture courses offered today in India are completely borrowed from the western modules. It is too well known how the western racist scholarship, out of contempt, has always dismissed everything good and worthwhile about non Abrahamic native cultures. Not surprising that only ills like dowry, caste and discrimination, shaiva-vaishnava conflicts are cherry picked from Indian society to be ‚Äòtaught‚Äô in our syllabi and never any worthwhile data about the glorious scientific architectural knowledge systems! \nLet us understand that the infights of our kings and kingdoms were more about political power monging and not about temple destructions and genocide. But the textbooks effectively whitewash the Abrahamic onslaughts as just like ‚Äòany other‚Äô Indian infights, cleverly concealing the fact that while shaivas-vaishnava conflicts were mostly ideological differences and community clashes and not ghastly wars and bloodshed. But the misleading narratives cleverly equate these to the Islamic and Christian genocides in India that claimed millions of lives, destroyed thousands of temples, lakhs of gurukulas, devastated countless prosperous trades, occupations and local markets, uprooted well established societal models, looted, raped, enslaved, killed, converted and impoverished in unimaginable measures, that too for centuries at a stretch! Comparing a wound to a cancerous tumour is what is done so convincingly in our ‚Äòtextbooks‚Äô! \nIn the colonial age western ‚Äòscholarship‚Äô dismissed off every Indian (hindu, buddhist, jaina or tribal etc) cultural, academic, religious, economic feature as ‚Äòprimitive and outdated‚Äô without caring to explain why. They wrote loads of ‚Äòopinions‚Äô calling them ‚Äòobjective analysis‚Äô and filled them in the libraries across the world. But when the stunningly marvelous architectural monuments, made some native thinkers question these narratives, counter narratives were quickly weaved to explain how Hindu ethos had ‚Äònothing to do with‚Äô its world class contributions like yoga, architecture, Ayurveda, arthashastra, art, literature, etc.,! But the same narratives nevertheless keep silent when churchist claim the credit for economic progress in the west, while in reality they were the biggest blocks in the path of renaissance! \nUnfortunately our university Engineering, technical, management courses teach only about western books on architecture and not a line from our great treatises on building, sculpture, sciences arthashastra etc,. how much so ever relevant and substantial! If only we glance through our treatises and living traditions, the first thing they will notice is the beautiful connection between religion-cultural heritage and these sciences &amp; arts. Unlike in the west, where religion has been against sciences, in the Indian ethos, sciences and arts and every aspect of life has revolved around dharma. Everything here, material or spiritual, sceintifc or artistic, is indeed a form of contemplation of satya(truth) and sundara(divine beauty). But this original perspective is hardly comprehended by the newer generations because of the very big disconnect between the modern main stream academia and Indian knowledge traditions. Any defense for native explanations is instantly snubbed as irrational and communal, because ‚Äòrationality is the birth right of the west only‚Äô!\nSwami Vivekananda warned long ago to ‚Äòfirst Indianize the Indian education‚Äô. But unfortunately our education only got more and more enslaved in western narratives, post independence. We are made to feel secular and objective by simply endorsing the west. Discrediting the Hindu civilizational for its every achievement thus and silencing it with the secularism gag is an art that the racist scholarship of west has perfected over centuries. \nI am sure by the end of this course we all can draw a lot more information and insights into the original perspectives, concepts and accomplishments of our sanatana heritage. \nSorry for the long explanation. üôè"'<br />Author: 'vitruvian_daddy'<br />id: 'ncbe3f'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: "Please don't let people online do away with racism directed towards people of your nationality, different communities have realised that they need to speak up for themselves, we should too"<br />Body: "Some of the most active public discord servers, different chatboards and forums are moderated by muslims, they will permaban you from the platform instantly with no appeals accepted if you don't approve of their political opinion, which is complete irony as most of these servers/forums are tagged as gaming/chill that must mean one shouldn't indulge in political discussions to begin with.\n\nVirtue signalling by muslims is all time high considering all of them get pass on xenophobia as some admins of the concerning platforms are strongly opinionated muslims themselves (take as an example randia and rpakistan subs)\n\nI came across some exceptionally good bullshit today, words like racist/xenophobe/islamophobe/fascist are thrown around like crazy sometime completely out of context and blown out of proportion, ironically the same patrons of this vocabulary are often observed to be blatantly racist towards indian people, that too without any recoil as most raitas who engage in discourse with them are on the same page of the book.\n\nI've also noticed that raitas and white liberals actually buy into their bullshlt victim play, this guilt complex isn't helping at all, it won't make their(mud-slime's) hatred go away, rather it is aiding their cause of unchecked radicalization.\n\n&gt;These muslims LEGIT think they possess some sort of moral ground, that they are completely IMMUNE to any form of criticism which other ideologies are bound to, despite all misogyny, superstition, apartheid and injustice which goes on in muslim countries.

I have only seen one ultra conservative muslim in my entire life , he was born and brought up in Saudi , hasn't seen the guy hurt slightly or even cuss others , doesn't watch any movies and is puritanical. \n\nI am pretty convinced that ultra conservative Islamists as opposed to the western  (people who believe in this concept ie enjoyment translates to- drugs, alcohol, sex)  are far better in terms of decency and discipline. \n\nI am not an Islamist or an jihadi sympathiser.

Well if it is in danger, who is stopping you from travelling the whole world and preaching the message of love and devotion towards the Supreme? Who is stopping you from preaching the path of Yoga, the principles of Dharma, and the philosophy of Upanishads to the ignorant? Somebody preached that is why you are a Hindu. It could be your parents, your teacher or anybody. On one hand, you would neither follow your Dharma nor will you preach and revert the masses to Sanatana Dharma, and on the other hand, you would keep crying about why the percentage of Sanatanis is decreasing. Imagine being a doctor who has medicine that can cure your diseases and make you free. Would it be wise to keep it to yourself? Wouldn\'t you share it with others? Similarly, if you truly are a Sanatani belonging to the most ancient religion of the world, you would never feel ashamed in spreading its eternal message to the masses. Hardly any Sanatani strives to spread his Dharma to other lands. Instead, he forgets his Dharma in the name of assimilation and integration with western cults. There is no urgency, there is no passion to save the others from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThere was a pastor who tried to convert me. He told me that Jesus died for my sins and I should accept him as my Lord and Saviour.\n\nI gave some simple logical arguments and he had no answer for it.\n\n&gt;"How can I convert to a religion that says my beloved mother, who kept me 9 months in her womb, nourished me, loved me is going to hell just because she is a Hindu. How can I accept a guy whose bible says that my late father is in hell for the crime of not accepting this so-called "merciful" saviour? Talking about my sins, why didn\'t he die for the sins of Aristotle? Why didn\'t he die for the sins of Julius Caesar? Oh wait, he didn\'t even exist. Why didn\'t he die for the sins of billions of people who took birth and died before his arrival? Mankind is not 2000 or 7000 years old. And talking about Jesus\' suffering, well the soldiers of my country have suffered more to protect me than your Jesus could ever do in his 100 lifetimes. And please don\'t tell me the story of Adam and Eve. Suppose they had 10000 children. Now, are those biological brothers and sisters going to mate with each other to produce more? Do you want to tell me that we are the products of incest? How can you call your God of Abraham kind and merciful when he has no problem sending innocent people to hell, not for a day or year, but eternity?"\n\nSee, this is how you engage in a debate. This is how you argue. The fundamental philosophies of Abrahamic religions are full of loopholes and contradictions. **If the Sanatanis had not been so lazy, Sanatana Dharma would have been prospering in so many countries.** **Apart from ISKCON, I hardly see any enthusiasm in other organizations in preaching the truth and reverting people to Sanatana Dharma**. Don\'t call human Gurus and Babas as God. You would simply make a fool of yourself. Worship the one Supreme God. As a Vaishnav, I worship no one but the Supreme Lord Shri Krishna. Try to assimilate and bring all the philosophies together and present Sanatana Dharma as a unified Religion to the people. Read Bhagavad-Gita, analyze the texts of important Upanishads in your free time, and always do a comparative study of Dharma with Abrahamic cults to save people from nescience and guide them towards the Truth. Chant every day, live a disciplined life. By looking at your devotion, they would also one day express their interest in Dharma.\n\nHare Krishna!'<br />Author: 'vacationinParadis'<br />id: 'nc148c'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: 'SECULAR DOGE'<br />Body: 'Will something happen if I donate him on Gpay .will police activity take action on him?'<br />Author: 'AxomiyaGamer'<br />id: 'nc0w2y'<br />Flair :Viraat Sanataniüö©</li><li>Title: '‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ !

Some of the things that could be included are as follows:\n\n* Daily Dharmic discussion, eg, it could be one Shloka from Shrimad Bhagwad Geeta, it could be about the speciality of the day,like the calendar day according to Hindu Calendar,Stories from dharmik granths.\n* Daily Darshan photos \n* Information about REAL history\n* Constructive debates about dharma.\n* Basic Dharmic education(Which most hindus do not have).\n* Politics- Only concerning dharma.\n* Taking up local group activities.\n\nAlso, these groups must have Same nomenclature. For eg. if there is a Hindu Dharmik Discussion group for an Apartment with the name XYZ the name of the group could be "Dharm Charcha- XYZ". A Hindu person could belong to atleast 2 groups like a group for where he/she lives and a Hindu Dharmik discussion group among st relatives,etc\n\nPlease suggest your views!'<br />Author: 'NirbharIndian'<br />id: 'nc0vig'<br />Flair :Sanatan Dharm üïâÔ∏è</li><li>Title: 'Happy ‡§à‡§Ç‡§ü ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§≤ ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§∞ü§≤'<br />Body: '..'<br />Author: 'frogmover'<br />id: 'nc0o4s'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Tired of the hypocrisy of Hindus'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'vacationinParadis'<br />id: 'nc0n8d'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'Happy ‡§á‡§Ç‡§† ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§≤ ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§•‡§∞ü§≤'<br />Body: '..'<br />Author: 'frogmover'<br />id: 'nc0n6r'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'Make Mamata Banerjee "Maut ki Saudagarni"'<br />Body: 'The post to make Modi the "Silent PM" got 3k upvotes over at "You Know Where".

This is a sarkaar which of only uses Hindu votes to retain power by making false and misleading promises.\n\nInitially when they came to power, I was hoping they would take action against the corrupt leaders (remember that India voted against the massive scams in 2014)..... NOTHING happened to anyone who did the scams....nothing....lots of cases were filed but if you look at actual progress, nothing.\n\n When the opposition claims that the Govt uses CBI, ED etc for political purposes, you have to accept there is merit. After all, we see a lot of action just ahead of elections and then nothing happens. What happened to the DLF scam, or Sardha Scam, or 2G scam, or Coal scam......all progress has been done by the courts.....the govt does not care....and worse still, they use these agencies to make politicians from other parties join the BJP and lo behold, the same people who bled the country dry, become clean and pure.\n\nLet's take another example. Delhi. We know AK is an imbecile who has blood on his hands. What prevents the Govt from saying Delhi will become a UT because you cannot have a megalomaniac incharge of the capital. How drama on Delhi Police during Farmer Protests was shocking but BJP still did nothing. For a simple reason. They don't want better governance in Delhi, they want a BJP CM in Delhi. This is not a party which is thinking about national interests. This is a party focussed on winning seats.\n\nAsk yourself, why are our temples still controlled by the Govt. Why have MORE temples come under Govt control? Why does the Govt not leave the temples alone. And the reason is simple. Santa Gobi needs the funds from the temples to fund his grand schemes and he does not have the courage to go after the institutions of other faiths. Hindus are easy game. He takes funds from our temples and uses them to fund minority welfare schemes and does not have the courage to use funds from the other religious organisations to fund their community causes.\n\nNo action on corruption.\nNo action on the Parivaar.\nThey keep inducting tainted leaders from other parties into BJP but somehow expect us to believe that these crooks will be more honest.\n\nThey have no hesitation in tying up with anti India parties like PDP, NCP, SS in pursuit of power. They have very cute explanations like we are being strategic and we are playing 4D chess but it is simple a naked play for power. Even today, if NCP decides to tie up with BJP, BJP will happily do that. Or is SS decides, they will be fine. This lot pretends to be moral bit at the end of the day, they are the same as all others.\n\nLook at the crisis with China. First Gobi believed that Xi would love him because he called him over for 02 summits. Then their idiocy led to 20 brave Indian men being killed in cold blood. And now we have given up the heights we controlled even though China refuses to pull back. Markmy words, Modi will not do anything to push China back because under pressure, he looks for face savers and not resolute action. In another 2-3 years, the chinese occupation of our lands will become the defacto border and these same cowards will explain how this is a masterstroke to buy peace with the Chinese....I hope I am wrong but I don't think I will be.\n\nCase in point CAA protects, Delhi Riots, 26 Jan riots, Farmers Protests and now Corona.....complete mis-governance...... repeatedly....and what is the point of blaming the opposition......either you have the courage to push change through or you shut your trap and sit quiet.....they have made a habit of becoming half pregnant and then not knowing what to do.....and when they lose their nerve, then the start blaming everyone.....the opposition, the courts, the media.....who said change was easy....either you have the courage to do it and follow through or you shut up and stop pretending......\n\nFinal point, people have lost their loved ones in 2nd wave. People will not forget. BJP thinks they will. I don't think so. BJP will be blamed and yes a lot of it is politics but a lot of it is also fair blame. You can't run a presidential system and then pretend you want parliamentary democracy. They want to run the country in the name of Modi then be prepared for the blame as well. \n\nAnd I can assure you that NOT A SINGLE babu or neta will be held accountable for the Covid lapses. Wait and watch. There will be lots and lots of noise but very little accountability. \n\nThat has been the case since Modi came to power. He is so enamoured with the babudom that he will not hold anyone accountable. He will say all the right things but judge him by his actions and you will see that he is more nehruvian than you would like to admit.\n\nI see a lot of people here talk about how this sarkaar is the last resort for Hindus. I say BS. Our dharma has survived Mongols and Britishers. Even an Italian queen. \n\nWe can survive. The real issue is the false sense of security that we have allowed ourselves to have. We think this is our govt. That is BS. By all yardsticks, this govt does not care about Hindu samaj. They have no interest in the community beyond making it a captive votebank and scaring us to keep us compliant. Our biggest mistake is that we think sarkaar will change things for us. Only we can change things for ourselves. \n\nNo sarkaar will change things for us. So let's wake up and stop being treated like a captive votebank by a bunch of arrogant and egotistical leaders who pretend to care about us and our causes but do everything to belittle our agenda.\n\nMany on this sub will not like what I have written.\nI am sure many more will downvote me.\nSome will call me Randian and Librandu.\n\nI don't mind it. Because if I can help even one patriot see the scam that is happening in the name of our dharma, then it is worth it. This lot does not deserve to represent us. It may be the least worst option but we deserve better. And if that means we have to get rid of this lot and suffer a few more terms of UPA etc, so be it\n\n At least that will remind RSS and BJP that they are because of us and not the other way around. They seem to have forgotten that completely in their zeal to become truly secular......\n\nJai Shri Ram.....Jai Maa Kali"<br />Author: 'thanoscommeth'<br />id: 'nbv86o'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'They are called goat fuckers for a reason'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sio9rqexyy61.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f0e0be45e516435fef1aaa3f3f4cbca5b810a9'<br />Author: 'Due-Yogurtcloset1338'<br />id: 'nbtxgo'<br />Flair :PKMKB_Boys played well üáµüá∞</li><li>Title: 'This is a level 5 disaster'<br />Body: 'Secular doge and liberal doge channels all videos have been wiped off .

It's regarding the Nehru/Gandhi Family. Things you and I weren't aware. Please share this."<br />Body: 'What are some of the best kept secrets about the Nehru/Gandhi family?\n\nIndira Gandhi: Intellectual Indira was admitted in Oxford University but driven out from there for non-performance. She was then admitted to Shantiniketan University but, Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore chased her out for bad conduct. After driven out of Shantiniketan, Indira became lonely as father was busy with politics and mother was dieing of tuberculosis in Switzerland. Playing with her loneliness, Feroze Khan, son of a grocer named Nawab Khan who supplied wines etc to Motilal Nehru‚Äôs household in Allahabad, was able to draw close to her. The then Governor of Maharashtra, Dr. Shriprakash warned Nehru, that Indira was having an illicit relation with Feroze Khan. Feroze Khan was then in England and he was quite sympathetic to Indira. Soon enough she changed her religion, became a Muslim woman and married Feroze Khan in a London mosque. Indira Priyadarshini Nehru changed her name to Maimuna Begum. Her mother Kamala Nehru was totally against that marriage. Nehru was not happy as conversion to Muslim will jeopardize her prospect of becoming Prime Minister. \n\nSo, Nehru asked the young man Feroze Khan to change his surname from Khan to Gandhi. It had nothing to do with change of religion from Islam to Hinduism. It was just a case of a change of name by an affidavit. \n\nAnd so Feroze Khan became Feroze Gandhi, though it is an inconsistent name like Bismillah Sarma. Both changed their names to fool the public of India. When they returned to India, a mock vedic marriage was instituted for public consumption. Thus, Indira and her descendants got the fancy name Gandhi. Both Nehru and Gandhi are fancy names. As a chameleon changes its colour, this dynasty have been changing its name to hide its real identity. \n\nIndira Gandhi had two sons namely Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. Sanjay was originally named as Sanjiv that rhymed with Rajiv, his elder brother‚Äôs name. Sanjiv was arrested by the British police for a car theft in the UK and his passport was seized. On Indira Gandhi‚Äôs direction, the then Indian Ambassador to UK, Krishna Menon misusing his power, changed his name to Sanjay and procured a new passport. Thus Sanjiv Gandhi came to be known as Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nIt is a known fact that after Rajiv‚Äôs birth, Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi lived separately, but they were not divorced.\n\nThe book ‚ÄúThe Nehru Dynasty‚Äù (ISBN 10:8186092005) by K. N. Rao states that the second son of Indira (or Mrs. Feroze Khan) known as Sanjay Gandhi was not the son of Feroze Gandhi. He was the son of another Muslim gentleman named Mohammad Yunus.\n\nInterestingly Sanjay Gandhi‚Äôs marriage with the Sikh girl Menaka took place in Mohammad Yunus‚Äô house in New Delhi. Apparently Yunus was unhappy with the marriage as he wanted to get him married with a Muslim girl of his choice. It was Mohammad Yunus who cried the most when Sanjay Gandhi died in plane crash. In Yunus‚Äô book, ‚ÄúPersons, Passions &amp; Politics‚Äù (ISBN-10: 0706910176) one can discover that baby Sanjay was circumcised following Islamic custom.\n \nIt is a fact that Sanjay Gandhi used to constantly blackmail his mother Indira Gandhi, with the secret of who his real father is. Sanjay exercised a deep emotional control over his mother, which he often misused. Indira Gandhi chose to ignore his misdeeds and he was indirectly controlling the Government. When the news of Sanjay Gandhi‚Äôs death reached Indira Gandhi, her first question was ‚ÄúWhere are his keys and his wrist watch?‚Äù. Some deep secrets about the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty seems to be hidden in those objects.The plane accident was also mysterious. It was a new plane that nosedive to a crash and yet the plane did not explode upon impact. It happens when there is no fuel. But the flight register shows that the fuel tank was made full before take-off. Indira Gandhi using undue influence of PM‚Äôs office prohibited any inquiry from taking place. So, who is the suspect?\n\nThe book ‚ÄúThe Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi‚Äù (ISBN: 9780007259304) by Katherine Frank sheds light on some of Indira Gandhi‚Äôs other love affairs. It is written that Indira‚Äôs first love was with her German teacher at Shantiniketan. Later she had affair with M. O. Mathai (father‚Äôs secretary), then Dhirendra Brahmachari (her yoga teacher) and at last with Dinesh Singh (Foreign Minister).\n\nFormer Foreign Minister K Natwar Singh made an interesting revelation about Indira Gandhi‚Äôs affinity to the Mughals in his book ‚ÄúProfile and Letters‚Äù (ISBN: 8129102358). It states that- In 1968 Indira Gandhi as the Prime Minister of India went on an official visit to Afghanistan. Natwar Sing accompanied her as an IFS officer in duty. After having completed the day‚Äôs long engagements, Indira Gandhi wanted to go out for a ride in the evening. After going a long distance in the car, Indira Gandhi wanted to visit Babur‚Äôs burial place, though this was not included in the itinerary. The Afghan security officials tried to dissuade her, but she was adamant. In the end she went to that burial place. It was a deserted place. She went before Babur‚Äôs grave, stood there for a few minutes with head bent down in reverence. Natwar Singh stood behind her. When Indira had finished her prayers, she turned back and told Singh ‚ÄúToday we have had our brush with history.‚Äù Worth to mention that Babur was the founder of Mughal rule in India, from which the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty have descended.\n\nIt is difficult to count how many institutes of higher education are named after Rajiv Gandhi but, Rajiv Gandhi himself was a person of low calibre. From 1962 to 1965, he was enrolled for a Mechanical Engineering course at Trinity College, Cambridge. But, he left Cambridge without a degree because, he could not pass exams. Next year in 1966, he joined Imperial College, London but, again left it without a degree.\n\nK. N. Rao in the above said book alleges that Rajiv Gandhi became a Catholic to marry Sania Maino. Rajiv became Roberto. His son‚Äôs name is Raul and daughter‚Äô name is Bianca. Quite cleverly the same names are presented to the people of India as Rahul and Priyanka.\n\nIn personal conduct Rajiv was very much a Mughal. On 15th August 1988 he thundered from the ramparts of the Red Fort: ‚ÄúOur endeavor should be to take the country to heights to which it belonged about 250-300 years ago. It was then the reign of Aurangzeb, the ‚Äòjeziya‚Äô master and number one temple destroyer.‚Äù The press conference that Rajiv Gandhi gave in London after taking over as prime minister of India was very informative. In this press conference, Rajiv boasted that he is not a Hindu but a Parsi. Feroze Khan‚Äôs father and Rajiv Gandhi‚Äôs paternal grandfather was a Muslim gentleman from the Junagadh area of Gujarat. This Muslim grocer by the name of Nawab Khan had married a Parsi woman after converting her to Islam. This is the source where from the myth of Rajiv being a Parsi was derived. Mind that he had no Parsi ancestor at all. His paternal grandmother had turned Muslim after having abandoned the Parsi religion to marry Nawab Khan. Surprisingly, Parsi Rajiv Gandhi was cremated as per Vedic rites in full view of Indian public. \n\nDr. Subramanian Swamy writes that Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs name was Antonia Maino. Her father was a mason. He was an activist of the notorious fascist regime of Italy and he served five years imprisonment in Russia. Sonia Gandhi have not studied beyond high school. She learnt some English from a English teaching shop named Lennox School at the Cambridge University campus. From this fact she boasts of having studied at the prestigious Cambridge University. After learning some English, she was a waitress at a restaurant in Cambridge town.\n\nSonia Gandhi had intense friendship with Madhavrao Scindia in the UK, which continued even after her marriage. One night at 2 AM in 1982, Madhavrao Scindia and Sonia Gandhi were caught alone together when their car met an accident near IIT Delhi main gate.\n\nWhen Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were Prime Ministers, PM‚Äôs security used to go to New Delhi and Chennai international airports to send crates of Indian treasures like temple sculptures, antiques, paintings etc to Rome. Arjun Singh as CM and later as Union Minister in charge of Culture used to organize the plunder. Unchecked by customs, they were transported to Italy to be sold in two shops named Etnica &amp; Ganpati, owned by Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs sister Alessandra Maino Vinci.\n\nIndira Gandhi died not because her heart or brain were pierced by bullets, but she died of loss of blood. After Indira Gandhi was fired upon, Sonia Gandhi strangely insisted that bleeding Indira Gandhi should be taken to Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, in opposite direction to AIIMS which had a contingency protocol to precisely deal with such events. After reaching Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Sonia Gandhi changed her mind and demand that Indira Gandhi should be taken to AIIMS, thus wasting 24 valuable minutes. It is doubtful whether it was immaturity of Sonia Gandhi or a trick to speedily bring her husband to power.\n\nRajesh Pilot and Madhav Rao Scindia were strong contenders to the Prime Minister‚Äôs post and they were road blocks in Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs way to power. Both of them died in mysterious accidents.\n\nThere are circumstantial evidences pointing to the prima facie possibility that the Maino family have contracted LTTE to kill Rajiv Gandhi. Nowadays, Sonia Gandhi is quite unabashed in having political alliance with those like MDMK, PMK and DMK who praise Rajiv Gandhi‚Äôs killers. No Indian widow would ever do that. Such circumstances are many, and raise a doubt. An investigation into Sonia‚Äôs involvement in Rajiv‚Äôs assassination is necessary.\n\nYou may read Dr. Subramanian Swamy‚Äôs book ‚ÄúAssassination Of Rajiv Gandhi ‚Äî Unasked Questions and Unanswered Queries‚Äù (ISBN : 81-220-0591-8). It contains indications of such conspiracy. In 1992, Sonia Gandhi revived her citizenship of Italy under Article 17 of the Italian Citizenship Law. Under Italian law, Rahul and Priyanka are Italian citizens because Sonia was an Italian citizen when she gave birth to them. Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs Italian is better than his Hindi. Rahul Gandhi is an Italian citizen is relevant from the fact that on 27th September 2001 he was detained by the FBI at Boston airport, USA for traveling on an Italian passport. If a law is made in India that important posts like that of President and Prime Minister should not be held by a person of foreign origin, then Rahul Gandhi automatically disqualifies to contend for the post of Prime Minister.\n\nAfter finishing school education, Rahul Gandhi got admission at the St. Stephens College in New Delhi, not on merit basis but on sports quota of rifle shooting. After a brief stay there in 1989-90, he did his BA from Rollins College, Florida in 1994. Just for doing BA one need not go to the US. The very next year, in 1995 he got M.Phil. degree from Trinity College, Cambridge. The genuineness of this degree is questioned as he has done M.Phil. without doing MA. Amaratya Sen‚Äôs helping hand is thought to be behind. \n\nIn 2008 Rahul Gandhi was prevented from using an auditorium of the Chandra Shekhar Azad University in Kanpur for a students‚Äô rally. Subsequently, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, V.K. Suri, was ousted by the UP Governor. During 26/11 when the whole country was tense about how to tackle the Mumbai terror, Rahul Gandhi was lavishly partying with his friends till 5 AM. Rahul Gandhi advises austerity for all Congress members. He says it is the duty of all politicians to be austere.\n\nOn the other hand he has a ministerial bungalow with a fully equipped gym. He is a regular member of at least two of the Delhi‚Äôs poshest gyms, one of which is 5-star rated. Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs trip to Chennai in 2009 to campaign for austerity cost the party more than Rs 1 Crore. Such inconsistencies show that initiatives taken by Rahul Gandhi are not his own but, workout of his party men only.\n\nDuring the 2007 election campaign in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi said that ‚Äúif anyone from the Nehru-Gandhi family had been active in politics then, the Babri Masjid would not have fallen‚Äù. It doubtlessly shows his Mohammedan affiliation as a loyalty to his ancestors.\n\nOn Dec 31, 2004, John M. Itty, a retired college professor in Alappuzha district of Kerala, contended that action should be taken against Rahul Gandhi and his girlfriend Juvenitta alias Veronica for staying together for three days at a resort in Kerela. It is a criminal offense under Immoral Trafficking Act as they are not married. Anyway, one more foreigner daughter-in-law is waiting to rule the tolerant Indians.'<br />Author: 'Paarth_r'<br />id: 'nbkbuz'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: "From a while we haven't heard about our cold stone Amit Shah.

So here is the truth about palestine. \n\nPalestine was actually inhabited by dragonborns for millions of years, who slayed dragons and dinosaurs alike since previous 350 million years. Its a fake theory that dinosaurs were wiped out by asteroid, the reality is that they were wiped out by a legendary shout written in asmaani kitaab- "ola uber". This shout made dragonborns burst like popcorn. By the grace of popat mermaid, dragonborn inhabitants of palestine wiped out dinosaurs from earth 1400 years ago with a very powerful blast. The blast was so powerful that the flat earth bent itself to form a sphere. This has been explained in aayat 69 sura 420 but u kaafirs think us to be unscientific. Usa stole the story of dragonborn to make the game the elder scrolls 5 skyrim and sanghi rss used founding titan to erase memories of the past about dragonborns. \nMasolla'<br />Author: 'chacha420op'<br />id: 'nbd407'<br />Flair :Wholesome Bakchodi :danklaugh:</li><li>Title: 'What a chutiya conservative intolerant shit sub Reddit lmfao y‚Äôall are so close to being straight up Nazis'<br />Body: 'Gg mofos I‚Äôm outta here.

Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 2:223. \n\n \n\n**9. Husbands are a degree above their wives.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 2:2228. Again, a footnote explains that the degree is more a matter of greater responsibility to assist in maintaining the wife, than she to him. They are equal under the law, but economically women are subject to special protections that men are not. The verse doesn‚Äôt imply that husbands are better per se, but that they have a more significant burden to uphold in maintaining the relationship.\n\n**8. A male gets a double share of the inheritance over that of a female.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 4:11 (also 4:176). I don‚Äôt really have any refutation of this, as all of the sources I can find seem to indicate this same, but at the same time don‚Äôt offer anything as to why that is ‚Äî meaning that ‚Äúbecause men are better than women‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid conclusion to draw.\n\n**7. A woman‚Äôs testimony counts half of a man‚Äôs testimony.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 2:282. I don‚Äôt have any footnotes about it, but the passage could be taken one of a few ways, and the interpretation *American Thinker* takes isn‚Äôt what seemed to jump out at me. The context has to do with making a written agreement about something that will come to pass in the future, such as a transaction where payment would be due (instead of an immediate exchange), and having witnesses present as the contract is written ‚Äî having two men as witnesses, and if there is only one man around, then the man and two women will work, ‚Äúso that if one of them errs, the other can remind her.‚Äù As with #9, this seems to put more weight of responsibility upon the male, and making polite concessions to women ‚Äî instead of saying that women are less trustworthy. A key aspect of the moment is that ‚Äúso the other can remind her,‚Äù in that, perhaps the burden of recollection is on the two separate parties, in that a man is legally bound to recall the matter squarely upon himself individually, without assistance ‚Äî and that the two-woman party is its own legal entity whereby the burden might be shared. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any party which the male may be reminded, so the greater burden for proof is upon the male. Not necessarily that women can‚Äôt handle the burden, but they are offered greater protection from error in the matter.\n\n**6. A wife may remarry her ex-husband if and only if she marries another man, they sleep together, and then this second man divorces her.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 2:230. There‚Äôs a footnote that indicates that the particular variety of divorce described here is the third ‚Äúirrevocable‚Äù kind. Earlier in 2:229, ‚ÄúA divorce is permissible only twice: after that, the husbands should retain their wives together on equitable terms, or let them go with kindness.‚Äù The footnote remarks that 2:230 refers to a third divorce ‚Äî after the two have split up twice and have reunited again, than the third one is not permitted to occur until she has married someone else first, been divorced again (a fourth time total, for her). ‚ÄúIn that case, there is no blame on either of them if they reunite..‚Äù The issue seems to center specifically on permission to reunite again after the third divorce, rather than an implied inequality that the man unfairly will not also have to remarry to a different woman and be divorced in order to marry her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**5. Slave-girls are property for their male owners, in a lusty sense.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 4:24. At this point the list seems to take a drastic turn for stretching interpretation, without even bothering to examine much of the context at all. *American Thinker* goes specifically to an interpretation of rape (citing \\[a\\]4:3; \\[b\\]23:5‚Äî6; \\[c\\]33:50; and \\[d\\]70:22‚Äî30) but the phrase, ‚Äúprovided ye seek them in marriage ‚Ä¶ desiring chastity, not lust,‚Äù in 4:24 flies directly in the face of that. It also says the male needs to pay the dowry and such as necessary. The other passages cited as reference: \\[a\\] refers specifically to marriage, not lustful pursuits; \\[b\\] refers specifically to marriage, as an exception to a list item of ‚Äúbelievers who eventually win through,‚Äù ‚Äú..who abstain from sex; \\[c\\] a footnote in my copy states that a condition about paying a dowry for a slave is is a moot issue since slavery has been disbanded by international agreement; \\[d\\] a footnote restates that there is now no sense of ‚Äúcaptives of war‚Äù because the practice has been made obsolete. Previously a wife who had been such a captive had lesser status as a wife within a multi-wife scenario until she was made free (by bearing a child of the male).\n\n**4. A man may be polygamous with up to four wives.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 4:3. The conditions for this particular passage refer specifically to the care of orphans, in that basically (paraphrased), ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not sure you‚Äôll be able to manage the orphan and his/her property rightfully and appropriately, you may take additional wives.‚Äù This is moreso an effort to relieve the burden of properly and respectfully caring for orphans over which the male finds himself guardian (through a relative‚Äôs death, etc), emphasizing that the matter is not about lustful endeavors of having more ladies to party with, but that the orphan would be genuinely taken care of, in an honest way.\n\n \n\n**3. A husband may simply get rid of one of his undesirable wives.** Referenced Passage: Sura 4:129. *American Thinker* states, flat-out, opposite of what this passage indicates. It says it‚Äôs not humanly possible to be identically fair between all of your wives (if more than one) but to never favor one over another and share your affections equally as best you can, with earnest attempts at doing so, and **not** to leave the other in limbo. I‚Äôm not sure how that could possibly be taken any differently.\n\n**2. Husbands may hit their wives even if the husbands merely** ***fear*** **highhandedness in their wives.** Referenced Passage: Sura 4:34. This passage actually gave me a bit of a chuckle because of the English translation offered ‚Äî ‚ÄúAs to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them first, next, refuse to share their beds, and last, spank them lightly; but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means of annoyance.‚Äù A footnote states, ‚Äú‚Ä¶if this is not sufficient, some slight physical correction may be administered; but Imam Shafii considers this inadvisable, though permissible, and all authorities are unanimous in deprecating any sort of cruelty, even of the nagging kind‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **1. Mature men are allowed to marry prepubescent girls.** Referenced Passage ‚Äì Sura 65:1,4. The passage is talking about divorces, and that a divorce shouldn‚Äôt be considered final until certain ‚Äúprescribed periods‚Äù have completed (meaning, sections of time reserved for something, like fasting, in consideration of the divorce ahead ‚Äî not periods in the sense of menstruation). In that context, treat both varieties of women ‚Äî who have their ‚Äúmonthly courses‚Äù (menstrual cycles) and who don‚Äôt ‚Äî as to having a prescribed period of 3 months.'<br />Author: 'Ornery-Brief5630'<br />id: 'nb3e8d'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihaad_Halal Certified</li><li>Title: 'The reason this sub-reddit is still alive is because of that lgbtq flag in the banner.'<br />Body: "r/chodi has a lot of homophobic/radical stuff, people will send you death treats if you're a muslim (I am not a muslim), yes criticizing someone's faith is okay, but that doesn't mean you'll give someone personal/death threats, that lgbtq flag makes reddit think that this is a foward thinking subreddit, while actually it's not."<br />Author: 'Ornery-Brief5630'<br />id: 'nb36zn'<br />Flair :Low Effort Shitpost ü§≥</li><li>Title: 'Can anyone explain what‚Äôs going on with Israel and Palestine?'<br />Body: 'I want to know the history of the region.

The 10 minutes you spend reading this can be used somewhere else.I‚Äôve only written this as I didn‚Äôt  have anything else to do for an hour and no one to ask for help.\n\n\nNarcissist-A disorder in which a person has an inflated sense of self-importance.\nNarcissistic personality disorder is found more commonly in men. \nSymptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism and a sense of entitlement.\n\nThis is what my mother calls my father on a daily basis. To be honest I didn‚Äôt know what it meant so I had to google it online and saw the description mentioned above.my father,being a doctor is regarded pretty high in the society. Ever since I could remember I‚Äôve seen my father get respect from passers by and this made  me think that being a doctor isn‚Äôt that bad. There are  people who tell themselves that if they had gone back to the past at a certain point,they would have still made the same decisions.I‚Äôm not from this group of people.after seeing all the things I‚Äôve witnessed in this house for the last 4 years, if I ever had a chance to go back,I‚Äôd gladly take it and get out of here. This family for the last 4years is basically what I can describe as a coin that is rusted on one side and shiny on the other. The shiny part is what the community thinks of this family.how we are perceived outside.the rusty part is the life inside the house .let‚Äôs start with the self proclaimed God of the house,my father. Being the elder son in his family,he always had a deep attachment to his parents. So deep that the bond between my grandmother and him are so close that whatever happens in this house regardless of whether it being a personal matter or not,whether privacy is needed or not,she will get to know anything and everything that happens in this house.there is a positive reinforcement that exists between them, in such a way that whatever he tells,she believes and follows and vice versa. There is no third person ever involved.He is someone who puts his mother and his brother‚Äôs family on a pedestal but treats her wife‚Äôs family like garbage. Countless times he has addressed my maternal grandparents with words that no should ever hear,in front of me and the rest of us.he uses similar words on the other members in that household as well. Even though on the outside he might seem as the ideal son in law,on the inside his intentions are different.\n\nMy father isn‚Äôt the same person today that I remember from my childhood. Granted even though his father paid for his education, he had worked initially in his career. He didn‚Äôt have to pay for the house he‚Äôs living in , and the fact that he didn‚Äôt have to pay for my education, were even though considered as ‚Äòwins‚Äô in his life, in reality these were basically seeds that would develop his narcissistic qualities. Having numerous pleasures such as going on countless trips abroad alone, his craving for alcohol,audio,cars,cameras and whatever new tech he catches his eyes on, has infact left him as barely the man he was before.what started out as a family trip 4 years back,I would‚Äôve never thought it will end with the family‚Äôs reckoning.if one line was my fathers spending money on his so called hobbies ,another line was my mother‚Äôs need to know how the money was being spent,these 2 lines crossed 4 years back. What led was countless fights involving numerous name calling by both parties,fights that led to even physical abuse by by father toward my mother on a number of occasions . This is done in front of their children,as they need an audience for their fights at all times. But outside the house, we‚Äôre this fake ‚Äúhappy‚Äù family that was living a fake ‚Äúhappy‚Äù life. The time I‚Äôve spent with them to try and solve their fights, the amount of times , me a grown adult had to cry so that they would just stop fighting are better not said. He displays his anger by smashing my mother‚Äôs appliances and the devices that she uses. And the worst part is , there is no one to control him. For anything. He has told me a number of times that he will do whatever he wants , whenever he wants and that no one can or will control him. In my opinion ,in his mind he thinks of himself as someone who will only live in luxury but in reality I think he has forgotten what life really is. He tries to spend money on whatever he can find to achieve happiness, but he can‚Äôt. What he gets every single time is temporary satisfaction. The fact that he gloats about the amount he‚Äôs spent on the premium wires he uses to connect his cables, and the experiences he‚Äôs had on his numerous trips he‚Äôs gone alone doesn‚Äôt help anyone. Has he provided for all of us, definitely yes.have we asked much,no. If the fact that he puts cameras all over the house to see if we are going somewhere, installing a tracker in the car to see where we take it, having direct access to me and my mother‚Äôs bank account to know how we spend each and every rupee, and eavesdrops on our conversations doesn‚Äôt show that he wants to control everything in the palm of his hands,I don‚Äôt know what else will. And if you think that we have access to his total expenditure on himself, wherever  he‚Äôs going abroad or how he‚Äôs generating money,sorry. Only he himself has access to that. His mother is always in support of him and thinks he is doing nothing wrong. \n\nSo who can bring justice to this family?who can right the wrongs done here?\nAnd what‚Äôs the point of even hanging on?.I‚Äôve told him a bunch of times,if he wants to live a life of a bachelor,none of us will stop him. Just let the outside world know it too.\n\n\nSchizoid personality disorder -A condition in which people avoid social activities and interacting with others.Schizoid personality disorder typically begins in early adulthood.People with this condition don't desire or enjoy close relationships, even with family, and are often seen as loners. They may be emotionally cold and detached.\n\n\nThis is the term used by my father to describe my mother‚Äôs present ‚Äúcondition‚Äù. According to him it has been like this since the beginning of their marriage. I struggle to believe that as I‚Äôve seen them happy together. Granted that it is more or less a miracle if i can ever see them happy now,there was a time when I didn‚Äôt worry about them.  My mother was someone who started her life with dreams. But after her marriage , she was pretty much forced to give up on that and look after the family as you do in Indian households. She had looked after my well being and had done more than what was needed so that both her children could have a good childhood. Even after this, once her children were somewhat grown up , she started pursuing an endeavour on her own. Without much support from the family including us, she was able to make herself a name in our community as one of the top in her field of art. Unlike me father ,  she  gave most of the money she received either to a charity or whatever would help her in pursuing her art. Looking back now , 4 years ago, we were a good family. With my father,mother and myself in respectable positions. But as fate would have it, the 2 lines that I had mentioned earlier just had to intersect and life in this house was never the same in this family.  My mother was having constant fights with her mother in law and my father , even though married and spends more of his time with his wife, listens to his mother‚Äôs advice regarding everything. Just as I had stated before, my grandmother is the more prominent figure in my father‚Äôs life than my mother can or ever will be. What started out as daily fights , this soon progressed to cussing of my mother‚Äôs parents and her family and finally led to certain episodes of physical abuse. My father,  as a doctor gave the same description of her countless times and that she needed medication. And me being a medical student at the time, blindly agreed. \n\nWas this true?. To be honest ,I can never be sure.  Do I think my mother has a problem, definitely yes. What else do you call someone who locks herself in a separate room, uses a cocktail of her phone,a power bank, the WiFi, the a.c and the bed for the majority of the day. This has happening for almost a year.Everyday she googles articles on narcissism and sends them to me along with long and very poorly written hate speeches about my father. I don‚Äôt read them all. In my phone ,the only person on mute is my mother . Not because I don‚Äôt want to help her, but I can‚Äôt. Even I myself had called my mother names similar to what my father calls her . The situation I‚Äôm in is a little tricky to say the least and umpteen messages and calls daily from my mother with complaints about me and my father will never allow me to keep their matter aside and focus on my career. She is very religious but I think at the moment she is relying too much on religion.So much so that she is close to religious fanaticism. Going behind religion and leaving your whole life in disarray is never the answer. She also has a lot of mood swings. My mother who shouts at me and who throws vocal abuse on me and my father in the morning and afternoon may change into a different person in the evening. As in more calm and composed.She might even sit for dinner with my father at night as if the whole fight was an act of some sort. And the fact is there is no reason for this . She can go from laughter to rage to crying in a matter of 10 minutes or so based on what she hears. Lately she has seemed a bit delusional at times, by telling me that her husband and his mother are plotting against her and associating certain animals to certain people. She has also relied on pseudoscientific practices so  as to find some meaning in her life. \n\nI don‚Äôt blame her for any of this. The fact that she gets very little respect as well as financial support from her husband,lack of support from her in laws and lack of a proper friends circle not including family members might be the reason . Even though she can call a certain member of the family as a friend, I don‚Äôt find it beneficial for her as she still remains locked up inside her room for most of the time.\n\nShe always tells me that she is staying together for the kids. Even though I had supported her a lot initially, right now I don‚Äôt think this relationship can survive.it‚Äôs like a dead animal inside the house or a leg that‚Äôs pretty much decayed and needs to get amputated. There is no point in keeping it any longer. Regarding support, I‚Äôve told her that I will always be there for her. She has gone through a lot In this house. I can‚Äôt say the same for my father as he‚Äôs not been in the receiving end of the suffering as much as my mother.\n\n\n\n\nUseless -not fulfilling or not expected to achieve the intended purpose or desired outcome.\n\n\nOther than calling my name, I think this has to be the word I‚Äôve been called the majority of the time by both my parents. It‚Äôs such a staple word in this household that to be honest I don‚Äôt mind it anymore. Granted they do speak much harsher words, but I think I recall this word the most to describe me. After a pretty much uneventful childhood, I had a bit of luck towards the end of school, and was able to enroll in a medical college. After putting in 2 years of hard work for my exam, and sacrificing a lot in the process I was not the same as before. I‚Äôd lost a lot of friends because of my pride and I was never able to adjust to the place that I had joined for my medical education. This was maybe because my father had decided where I should study rather than giving me a choice. Even though I was able to study , the fact had always remained in my head that I thought I deserved better . This led to me missing out on a lot of classes due to lack of will and my father had to solve the problems that I had created. You could say the fights between my parents  that started in the middle of my higher education could be one of the factors ,but I can‚Äôt say for sure if I would‚Äôve changed even if those never took place. The fact that even after becoming a doctor , I still didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to become and again lack of will, led me to lose some time. The comforts of my home didn‚Äôt help one bit in sharpening my vision for the future. The consistent questions and mockery from both my parents regarding my future was the icing on the cake. I don‚Äôt blame them for this though, as I‚Äôm a master at procrastination and often take a long time to do simple tasks. On rare instances I do attain a glimmer of inspiration and achieve a goal. The numerous fights between my parents that I had to intervene,the time that I had lost, the tears I‚Äôve shed, the abuse that I was yelled at, has affected me a lot to say the least. I think my sibling did make a better decision in life by not associating with them during their fights. Guess the mental trauma will stick with me. And the fact that I couldn‚Äôt share whatever was happening inside the house to anyone of the outside world, since our family has ‚Äúa good name‚Äù was not something easy to live with. Maybe this trauma was what has led me to become what I am now. The feeling of worthlessness is pretty strongly nailed on me by my parents. And I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know when I will be worth something.\n\nAll this had led me to believe that I don‚Äôt have a place in this house. There is a limit to how much you can fake to the outside world. Even though I lack intent while performing most of my tasks, the task that is at hand in front of me , is looming large. At least once should my actions have some importance. Doing most of the grunt work in the house, made fun of for my incompetence , and striving a lot for a happy family has taken its toll on me. For most homes, an understanding family with interwoven values is a given. For me , I consider this a miracle to say the least. With my father asserting complete dominance over my life,even when I‚Äôm an adult had often confused me. I thought it was the same for other households but I was wrong. And my mother‚Äôs daily tantrums about my father didn‚Äôt help one bit. All of this  had led me to take this decision.\n\nAccording to my mother , I had done something what she considers as the worst thing to ever happen to this family. Something she says that will never be forgiven and she will not allow it under any circumstance. According to my father we belong in a certain ‚Äúsection of the society ‚Äú and we cannot stoop low to another level  but we must look for associations that are either at the same level or above. These levels, sections has always puzzled me but my grandmother is pretty much a scholar in this field. She can categorically place each family in a locality as per a system that was baffling to me. I thought it was something that existed only in pre independent India but as far as I know it‚Äôs still at large. Basically a revamped caste system. There are many that I know of who instead of disregarding this system, use it to form associations and receive financial incentives for the said association. They take these financial incentives because they think they deserve it for being born in the right family. Going back to what my mother said, what she meant was that I had not followed this system and chose a path for my self. Even 1 year back,I‚Äôd never thought of doing something like this. I had geared up to be another member of this system. But I had met someone last year that made me change my line of thought . The grievous sin that I had committed was that I had asked my mother if I could have an association with a girl of another religion. I‚Äôm sure I need not worry about this in probably any other country . I think most of you will stop reading this here as I know the majority of readers follow the same system. Someone who was in the same profession I‚Äôm in, someone who I connected with a lot and was my pillar of support for a year , someone who was from a good family as well. ‚ÄúThe worst thing that a son could ever do‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe will disown you ‚Äú. Quotes such as these should have made me recalibrate my decision, but I‚Äôm fed up of this fake life. I‚Äôm sick of looking at a person  at the level their family is at or the amount of financial incentive received rather than the person itself. This financial incentive that my maternal grandfather gave my father cause of this system is now what‚Äôs ruining this family. I know  whatever relationship I had planned won‚Äôt work out, but I‚Äôm damn well sure I don‚Äôt want to be part of this pathetic system.\n\nSo my plan right now is first and foremost get out of this house. If you‚Äôve read until here, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm already out of this place. Until I find worth in my life or some sort of redemption for what I‚Äôve faced in there, I won‚Äôt be coming back. I‚Äôll promise to be a support for my parents at all times but they should find a solution for their situation. Never fight in front of your children. Never touch alcohol. Never think you‚Äôll achieve happiness by buying everything you set your eyes on. Never choose someone on the basis of their level in the society. Never demean your children. Life in this house has taught me all these ideals.But in the wrong way. I hope and pray that I can make it right one day."<br />Author: 'manofculture585'<br />id: 'nalae9'<br />Flair :Serious Discussion :Patel:</li><li>Title: 'The Greatest Heist in Indian History.
