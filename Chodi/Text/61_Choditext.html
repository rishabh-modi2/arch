I might get downvoted to hell for commenting this here. But i really want people to know that these things hurt and we as a society need to change. \n\nThe mother who is embarrassed or disgusted with the thought of his son as  she got so influenced by overthinking mentality of feminism that she now see his son as a rapist, please don’t step outside of their house ever on streets. The sister who believes his brother needs to be home because she thinks women are oppressed by males, shouldn't walk outside on rainy days as Indra Dev is angry at them. The women who falsely accused their husbands for domestic violence, rape shouldn't ask for dowry as this could negatively impact their feminist agenda. Women who look at all men as an rapists in buses, on roads, at workplaces. Women who get together to make men uncomfortable with words and gestures. Women who mutilate a man’s dignity, his soul, his mind in the name of patriarchy, shouldn't pray Dev. Don't offer water to Surya Dev! Don’t light the diya. Don’t sing his hymns. Don’t fast on Mondays for better soulpartner. First learn to respect each and every men you come across, be it your father, your brother, your male friends, your husbands, your sons or any man that passes by you. \n\nI know this is not every woman, but as the saying goes gehu ke sath ghun bhi pista hai...we need to remove even that small minority of women who use men as tool and take advantage to grow as a society. This paradox must end! Till it doesn't, please dont bother Surya dev, treating him and only him with respect won't make him happy at you. Woh Dev hai, woh sab dekhte hai aur sab samajhte hai. Woh kanoon ki tarah andhe nahi hai, kanoon se bach jaoge par jab Shiv apne raudra roop mai ayenge tab kya karoge? \n\nI hope dear FEMINISTS over here will understand and next time they see something disrespectful happening to any men they'll raise they're voice and do what's right. Because even today people saw them using and taking advantage of helpless and falsely accused men just because they're women who can put charges and noone will question them but no one turning up for their help. NO ONE. Stepped up. We may not be strong enough to fight back yet but Bhagwan Shiv is and he'll not let them go. \n\nThank you for listening to my opinion, i really wanted to say something and i apologize if anything i said something that hurting any FEMINIST'S sentiments, it wasn't my intention but it needed to be said."<br />Author: 'JimmyHopkins06'<br />id: 'jgt85b'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'Waqf Board Act'<br />Body: 'Everyone must read Waqf Board Act 1995.\nSpecially Section 40 which states that any property can be declared as Waqf property even without giving a prior notice to owner of that property.\n\nYou can also watch a video by Pushpendra Kulshershtra.'<br />Author: 'mythf__ker'<br />id: 'jgspsx'<br />Flair ::Patel: Serious Discussion</li><li>Title: 'My respect for Rajmouli is gone.

Of this, I am certain.**\n\nCommentary  ( by Shrila Prabhupada)\n\nThe [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) began with an inquiry of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sañjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kṛṣṇa was there. Kṛṣṇa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the master of renunciation.\n\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira. Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira’s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhiṣṭhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\n\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kṛṣṇa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: *man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.* One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa (*sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja*). The instructions of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the *Gītā* is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nFrom [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kṛṣṇa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/)*.* The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\nAnother feature of [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. If one understands Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kṛṣṇa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\nIn [*Bhagavad-gītā*](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/) five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and any other transcendental conception – exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness and difference.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of Kṛṣṇa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency\n\nSource for commentary-.[https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/78/](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/18/78/)\n\nSource for translation is from Chinmmayamission translation.\n\n  \n\n\n###'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jfy0qd'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: 'Jehadi h gaddar h,bhadkau h,suar h tu'<br />Body: '[removed]'<br />Author: 'New_knowledge_'<br />id: 'jfxj2j'<br />Flair ::Islam: Jihad</li><li>Title: 'Indian Arranged marraiges'<br />Body: ' I agree that everyone has a right to chose their life partners but making fun of arranged marraiges is also not right they are also quite successful.They have their own flaws but making fun of them is not right.I saw a video in which sandeep maheshwari making fun of arranged marraiges.I saw a research in sapiens that proves arranged marraiges lead to a happier society.As the divorce in these are quite low.

According to mohommad, you must not touch a girl unless she approves you to, and what is considered to be the approval? Her SILENCE.\n2. (Sahih al'bukhari 5456) mohommad said, do not wash your hands after u've eaten, unless you've licked the fingers, or had your fingers licked by someone else. Because if you wash your hands without Licking or getting licked, the 'blessings of 0la might get washed away. (his fetishes were ahead of our time that' s for sure).\n3. (bukhari Al-adab Al-mufrad 1183) mohommad's grandchild came running to him, mohommad held and hugged him, and put his tongue in the kid's mouth, exchanged spit(French kiss) , to give him the blessings of ola.\n4. (sahih al'bukhari 5068) mohommad used to have s€x with all his 9 wives, in a single night, but would take bath only once.\n5.

When should I come?”*\n\n*Max Muller who had great respect for Edison asked him to come on a suitable time when most of the scholars of the continent of Europe would be gathering in England.*\n\n *Accordingly, Edison took a ship and went to England. He was introduced to the audience. All cheered Edison’s presence.*\n\n*Later at the request of Edison, Max Muller came on the stage and spoke in front of the instrument.*\n\n*Then Edison went back to his laboratory and by afternoon came back with a disc &amp; played it on the gramophone.*\n\n*The audience was thrilled to hear the voice of Max Muller from the instrument.*\n\n*They were glad that voices of great persons like Max Muller could be stored for the benefit of posterity.*\n\n*After several rounds of applause and congratulations to Thomas Edison, Max Muller came to the stage and addressed the scholars and asked them,*\n\n*“You heard my original voice in the morning. Then you heard the same voice coming out from this instrument in the afternoon. Do you understand what I said in the morning or what you heard in the afternoon?”*\n\n*The audience fell silent because they could not understand the language in which Max Muller had spoken.*\n\n*It was ‘Greek and Latin’ to them as they say.*\n\n*But had it been Greek or Latin, they would have definitely understood because they were from various parts of Europe.*\n\n*It was in a language which the European scholars had never heard.*\n\n*Max Muller then explained what he had spoken.*\n\n*He said that the language he spoke was Sanskrit and it was the first sloka of Rig Veda, which says "Agni Meele Purohitam”*\n\n*This was the first recorded public version on the gramophone plate.*\n\n*अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवं रत्वीजम।*\n*होतारं रत्नधातमम।।*\n*(Rig Veda 1.001.01)*\n\n*Why did Max Muller choose this?*\n\n*Addressing the audience he said,*\n\n*“Vedas are the oldest text of the human race. And “Agni Meele Purohitam” is the first verse of Rig Veda.*\n\n*"In the most primordial time, when the people did not know how even to cover their bodies and lived by hunting and housed in caves, Indians had attained high civilization and they gave the world universal philosophies in the form of the Vedas.”*\n\n*When “Agni Meele Purohitam” was replayed, the entire audience stood up in silence as a mark of respect.*\n\n*The verse means :*\n\n*“Oh Agni, You who gleam in the darkness, to You we come day by day, with devotion and bearing homage. So be of easy access to us, Agni, as a father to his son, abide with us for our well being."*'<br />Author: 'NaastikaBhakta'<br />id: 'jdalxg'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'In countries where death penalty is banned.

Arbaz walked on to the stage with that little microphone cellotaped to his cheek.  The beads of sweat on his face showing up clearly on the monitor behind him.\n\nIn the audience were all the seculars.  They applauded.  This was their moment.  Their declaration of victory.  From this point on life was going to be beautiful.\n\n"Each and every one of you has made an indispensable contribution in to our struggle.  Today we can say that we have won because of you."\n\nThere you go! People in the audience were talking to each other.  Not that they had any doubts.  But they were told that they are the useful idiots and as soon as their side won the battle they would be put aside.  This is proof that they were wrong and we were right.  Not that anyone here had any doubt.\n\nArbaz proceeded to call out one by one these fighters.  They came to the stage.  Arbaz gave them a bouquet of red roses, and sprinkled rose attar on them and they were led off stage.  One by one.  As they got their due commendation, as the audience got thinner, those remaining applauded louder to compensate.\n\nWhen Rajdeep was called up, only Chetan was left in the audience.  He ran up to the foot of the stage and did a celebratory dance.  He shouted \'well done rajdeep\', \'you rock rajdeep\' and so on.  And finally only Chetan was left.  And his name was called.\n\nHe walked up.  Head held high and proud.  Chest swollen with pride.  Arms swinging like a muscled warrior.\n\nArbaz handed him the bouquet of roses.  "Thank you.  I am so proud to be part of the new beginning."  He said.  Arbaz smiled the most gentlest of smiles.  "You are welcome" he said, as he sprinkled attar on him.\n\nAs he turned around to walk off stage, the image of the gentle smile of Arbaz lingered in his mind.  Human beings, being human, he thought to himself.  As he walked through the side door and into the passage, he felt a warm feeling rising from his gut.  He felt amazing.\n\nThrough the door at the end of the passage he walked out to night.  He made out sounds of a crowd cheering.  He was on top of a flight of stairs which led to the parking lot.  He looked up and saw the flyover.  It was lined with people.  As he stood there, it was as if the crowds cheering rose.  Involuntarily, he raised his hand and waved.  The crowd cheered even more wildly.  \n\nThis is what I deserve, he thought to himself, as he walked down the flight of stairs.  He was now more sure than ever that he was on the right side of the fight.  Not that there was any doubt.\n\nHe stumbled on something, and looked down to see it was a sandal.  In his mind he imagined a woman holding up her saaree and running and one of her sandals coming off.  He saw another shoe.  Then few more.  Maybe people left their footwear here to …\n\nHe had reached the bottom of the flight of stairs.  He turned out and looked up at the crowd.  They were still cheering.  He raised his hand again.  It was as if they went crazy… or.. Laughing.  He could not tell.  Why would they laugh?\n\nHe looked ahead and saw one man standing in the middle of the lot, hands behind his back.  Smiling gently.  Four other men stood a little way away.  Hands behind their backs, smiling gently.  Probably to escort me to the car?  Take away the bouquet?  Get an autograph.\n\nThe wispy thin and long beard, the dug in cheeks, the skull cap, did not look like his typical fan.  He felt a gentle nudge.  He realised he had stopped walking.  Why?  He had nothing to fear now.  As he started walking, he tried to give the man a wide berth, but the person who was escorting him from the stage was gently nudging him towards the man.\n\nHe stopped a few feet from the man.  The man smiled at him.  Chetan smiled back.  He felt a gentle downward pressure on his shoulders.  He knew what he had to do.  He fell to his knees.  He realised what was going to happen to him.  He realised that the crowd had been standing out there for hours.  He realised that every single person who walked out faced the same fate.  The ones who had figured it out quicker would have struggled and tried to run.  That was the footwear.  \n\nHe felt disappointed.  He felt disappointed and let down by these people.  He fought for them and now they are dispensing with him.  This not right.\n\nHe kept his eyes open and as the lights started to fade, he tried in vain to say his last words.  \n\nHey Ram.'<br />Author: 'ekdhyan'<br />id: 'jcyctf'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: 'What happened to Je Suis Charlie?

Call the girl dumb, call her a traitor to the community, cry over it while the Muslim boys and liberals laugh at Hindu men looking like bitter incels while your hands are tied in the word of the law (and it should be, else we will have many other problems even in normal marriages).\n\nLove is consensual. It\'s a natural human emotion and it implies acceptance. If 2 adults love one another, there\'s nothing you can do. There\'s nothing called "love jihad." It\'s a made-up term by buffoons who don\'t know or are ignorant what the terms "love" or "jihad" mean.\n\nNow there is a non-consensual love, which is simply rape. It\'s defined as:\n\n&gt; unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly **or under threat of injury** against a person\'s will or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconsciousness,**or deception**\n\nWhen Lakshmi goes with Afroz, she doesn\'t expect to be treated like this. On the surface, it looks fine. The secular Hindu family is true to their values and respects their daughters wishes and it looks like the Afroz\'s family is also happy. \n\nBut little does she know that Afroz is not secular and expects her to convert. \n\nMaybe she doesn\'t know that polytheist women can never be a Muslim\'s wife, but at best a rakhel (concubine). Or knowing such, believes that my Afroz is different and not a religious fanatic.\n\nMaybe he first started to date her using the fake name Ashish. Lot of such cases happen like that. \n\nIs that not deception? Did she really consent to this treatment. After she is stuck in an abusive marriage, does she have a choice to leave it? Or is she threatened?\n\nWhy are we calling it consensual "love jihad" then? The intent is akin to rape and human trafficking.\n\nI say woman trafficking because there are cases in Hindi media (and I remember one from Panipat) in which a widow was tricked into vivah with a Muzlim man using a fake Hindu name then forced into a nikah with one of his friends.

If it breaks a rule please tell me and I will fix the post.\n\nThis is a response to a post made on r.librandu about casteism in hinduism. All the references he made are in bold and my response is below.\n\n**"The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced." (Rig Veda 10:90)**\n\nHow is this casteist? Is it saying Shudra\'s or any other caste are bad? It is describing the creation of the 4 varnas, not necessarily based on birth. And then again, wouldn\'t this mean Shudra\'s are important since people can barely function without feet, thus making Shudra\'s important? More over, Purusha is depicted in the sleeping position, making all parts of the body on the same level, possibly symbolising that all people are equal.\n\n**"I created mankind in four classes, different in their qualities and actions; though unchanging, I am the agent of this, the actor who never acts!” (Bhagavad Gita 4:13)**\n\nThis is just laughable. Krishna is specifically saying that caste is based upon qualities and actions, thus supporting the theory of caste based upon qualities and not birth.\n\n**"A person can never achieve freedom from reactions to activities without first performing prescribed Vedic duties: neither can perfection be attained by renouncing them as well.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:4)**\n\nThis again, is laughable. Where in the world does this mention caste? And the more accurate translation is "Not by non-performance of action does one reach actionless, and nor by mere renunciation does one attain perfection" And if "Vedic duties" is what makes this casteist, then how about the fact that each caste has perscribed Vedic duties, so this applies to everyone.\n\n**"No one exists for even an instant, without performing an action; however unwilling, every being is forced, to act by the qualities of nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:5)**\n\nNow, how is this casteist in nature? This is a simple fact that people have to perform action by qualities of nature, or the 3 guna\'s, being goodness passion and ignorance. This isn\'t casteist in the slightest.\n\n**"O Arjuna, the activities of the brahmanas, kastriyas , vaisyas and sudras are clearly divided according to the qualities born of their own nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 18:41)**\n\nNow this verse refers to how certain people are born with a certain nature with specific qualities, which will be better suited for certain occupations. Now, the verse says "born of their own nature" and not born of their family, which is the kind of system present in medieval times. So this means that a person born into a Shudra family can be considered as a Brahmin if he displays the nature and qualities required for that action.\n\nHe then goes on to quotes these verses here.\n\n**"The actions of a brahmana arising from his own nature are serenity, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honest, knowledge of the Vedas, wisdom and firm faith.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:42)**\n\n**"The actions of a ksatriya born of his own nature are heroism, exuberance, determination, resourcefulness, without trace of cowardice in battle, generosity and leadership.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:43)**\n\n**"The actions of a vaisya born of his own nature are agriculture, cow protection and trade; also the actions of a sudra born of his own nature consists in service to brahmana, ksatriyas and vaisyas.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:44)**\n\nThese verses are simply describing the qualities and characteristics of each varna, and does not even talk about any varna negatively .So let us move on.\n\n**"Following each his own activity, a man achieves finally perfection; now hear how the performer of action prescribed according to nature attains perfection.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:45)**\n\nThis again, can be explained by purpors of previous verses. And the actual verse reads "Devoted each to his own duty, man attains perfection, engaged in his own duty, he attains perfection". This verse talks about the duty of person, or dharma, which extends out of Varnashrama dharma, such as the dharma of a student or son, so we can take this talk of duty as extending to duty outside of caste.\n\n**"From whom is the existence of all living entities, by whom all this is pervaded; through worshipping Him, by one’s own actions prescribed according to nature a man achieves perfection.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:46)**\n\nAgain, this is explained by previous purports.\n\n**“It is better to engage in one’s own svadharma (occupation), even though one may perform it imperfectly than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one’s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:47)**\n\nThis verse confuses me as well, which is why I will try not to explain it without knowledge, so the original quoter can have this one.\n\n**“One should not abandon duties born of one’s nature, even if one sees defects in them, O son of Kunti. Indeed, all endeavors are veiled by some evil, as fire is by smoke.“ (Bhagavad Gita 18:48)**\n\nThis again, has explanations in other purports.\n\n**"It is far better to perform one’s svadharma (prescribed duties), even though faultily, than another’s duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one’s own duty is better than engaging in another’s duties, for to follow another’s path is dangerous.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:35)**\n\nThis is similar to verse 18:47, which I will not answer without full knowledge.\n\n**"With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born." (Bhagavad Gita 1:41)**\n\nFirst I am going to say, in this translation there is no mention of caste, so I am not sure where casteism came into the picture if he read only from this version.\n\nBut In actuality, the verse talks about intercaste marriage and why they shouldn\'t be done. The word *varnashankara* ( in sanskrit वर्णसंकर) is used here as it means those of mixed castes.\n\nHere is the verse with a proper translation:\n\n**"By the prevelence of impiety, Oh Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted, Oh decendant of the Vrishni clan, giving birth to intermingling of castes". (BG 1.41)**\n\nNow, If I am to explain this properly, I will first need to explain the context. This is spoken by Arjuna in the first chapter, not Krishna, so we need not take this as solid fact. Why we need not take this? Because this is still in the part of the Gita where Arjuna is still ignorant of much of life and its meaning, and will thus have many wrong preconceptions about the truth brought to him by his society.\n\nHowever, the reason why Arjuna speaks against the union of separate castes is because each caste has religious rituals special to that caste, and thus if union is made with different castes, such rituals will not be able to be performed, thus possibly inviting bad karma to the family. Arjuna explains this in the very next verse.\n\n**"An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of the sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall." (Bhagavad Gita 1:42)**\n\nSo, I don\'t take this reasoning as a particularly bad one.\n\nAfter this, the commenter makes references to the manusmriti, which to me is quit frankly laughable. These people should play a game, go to random hindu\'s, ask them if they have a manusmriti at home, or have heard of it. Maybe even go to a temple and ask them if they have a copy inside. The answers to all these questions will probably be no. This is because the manusmriti is not so much a religious text, but a 2000 year old law book, which the content of which reflects. It is of course filled with casteism and sexism, which is why it is mostly rejected by those who know of it. The Manusmriti is an obsolete text which doesn\'t doesn\'t have an ounce of importance to the hindu tradition, and thus can\'t be used to vilify hinduism.\n\nIn conclusion, none of these claims on hinduism promoting casteism in the Rigveda or Gita have any legs to stand on, and these arguments may be discarded.\n\nMany thanks for listening.'<br />Author: 'Accomplished-Ad-6524'<br />id: 'jc945u'<br />Flair ::Yogiji: Virat Hindu</li><li>Title: "Let's infiltrate r/librandu"<br />Body: 'Librandu ki g**d mar do\n[Discord server of librandu](https://discord.gg/yZ5ZHsD)'<br />Author: '_Smiling_Buddha_'<br />id: 'jc8q9z'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: "Let's infiltrate r/librandu"<br />Body: '[deleted]'<br />Author: '[deleted]'<br />id: 'jc8i3a'<br />Flair ::cup_coffee:Ask Bakchods</li><li>Title: 'A response to a comment on r/librandu on casteist quotes.'<br />Body: 'On the librandu subreddit, I found a post talking about how hinduism isn\'t as bad as many make it out to be, but a comment on the post then proceeded to show a large number of what he deemed to be casteist quotes.\n\nSo here I will  show the  "casteist" quotes provided by the commenter, and I shall attempt to refute them  them.\n\n**"The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya made. His thighs became the Vaiśya, from his feet the Śūdra was produced." (Rig Veda 10:90)**\n\nAgain, How is this casteist? Is it saying Shudra\'s or any other caste are bad? It is describing the creation of the 4 varnas, not necessarily based on birth. And then again, wouldn\'t this mean Shudra\'s are important since people can barely  function without feet, thus making Shudra\'s important? More over, Purusha is depicted in the sleeping position, making all parts of the body on the same level, possibly symbolising that all people are equal.\n\n**"I created mankind in four classes, different in their qualities and actions; though unchanging, I am the agent of this, the actor who never acts!” (Bhagavad Gita 4:13)** \n\nThis is just laughable. Krishna is specifically saying that caste is based upon qualities and actions, thus supporting the theory of caste based upon qualities and actions. \n\n**"A person can never achieve freedom from reactions to activities without first performing prescribed Vedic duties: neither can perfection be attained by renouncing them as well.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:4)**\n\nThis again, is laughable. Where in the world does this mention caste? And the more accurate translation is "Not by non-performance of action does one reach actionless, and nor by mere renunciation does one attain perfection" And if "Vedic duties" is what makes this casteist, then how about the fact that each caste has perscribed Vedic duties, so this applies to everyone.\n\n**"No one exists for even an instant, without performing an action; however unwilling, every being is forced, to act by the qualities of nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 3:5)**\n\nNow, how is this casteist in nature? This is a simple fact that people have to perform action by qualities of nature, or the 3 guna\'s, being goodness passion and ignorance. This isn\'t casteist in the slightest.\n\n**"O Arjuna, the activities of the brahmanas, kastriyas , vaisyas and sudras are clearly divided according to the qualities born of their own nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 18:41)**\n\nNow this verse refers to how certain people are born with a certain nature with specific qualities, which will be better suited for certain occupations.

I work in a very big stable company with complete job security (this detail is important for the rant). So there isn\'t any know incident of firing or layoff in recent times.\n\nJust before this Wuhan virus thing, around in February my immediate manager changed (those who are not yet in job, please note that in big organizations, there are several level of management). He is hardcore communist, literally hardcore. His Fb profile is full of anti-govt post (obviously central govt post because non BJP ruled state). He used to regularly participate in dhapli bajao type communist events on weekends before lockdown. Now coming to the rant part he is not manager of the project I am working on and literally every employee is fed up of him. He used to subtly ask to work more than 9 hours when lockdown started (Our organization policy is strictly against this). The people in this project are very cooperative and literally every one gave their best. \n\nnow after few month that subtle part of asking to over work is gone and he is directly saying to work as much as possible otherwise he will have to layoff (He don\'t of any such power and the organization won\'t allow it). He still can\'t say it on any recordable medium (email). Slowly this became very pushy, literally calling everybody and telling that they are not working up to the mark (trust me most of the people are working 12 hours except few of his close people). Now there came the part to send employee to office forcefully (It is not needed for the job, but staying at home will need some extra expenses which if he use, the profit of project will decrease). Some people convinced to office as he promised their will be some solution soon but later most  of them resisted.  "The solution" is still not ready, eventually everyone will have to go to office sooner than all other projects in this organization.\n\nHe regularly delays promotions of people exploiting loop holes of the policies. Removes people from the project if they are too rebellious and easily replacable. The thing is no one want to escalate the issue to higher management or change the job as people are afraid in this situation that what will happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t hate the fact that he is exploiting the people. I hate that, he used to say, fight for people, against the govt/establishment. But the place where is in power, he is doing literally the worst job. His facebook/ whatsapp is still filled with same tone against govt on literally every issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFInal outcome is, if you want people to believe in your ideology, implement it where you can and show that it is better instead of expecting someone else to do it where you have no power.'<br />Author: 'ImaginaryLibrary1'<br />id: 'jakanr'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: 'FIGHT'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lczb9vankws51.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9644431b6c11bf58e9a29c2c0341c72b1f1b7d7'<br />Author: 'AdiCrio'<br />id: 'jaiy1g'<br />Flair ::star: OC है बे </li><li>Title: '7 दिवस का प्रतिबंध।'<br />Body: 'आज चोदी में समुदाय विशेष के विषयमें की वह कितने शांति प्रिय है। पर एक मीम प्रदर्शित किया था । \nरेडिट के द्वारा 7 दिवसीय प्रतिबंध लगा दिया गया है उस अकॉउंट पर।'<br />Author: 'Satyam007'<br />id: 'jagl39'<br />Flair ::snoo_angry: Rant</li><li>Title: 'WhiteHatJr and Byjus Scam: An Update after Ken and Morning Context Articles.'<br />Body: 'Hello there\n\nSo after [The Ken article](https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-silencing-of-online-dissent/), Byjus and WhiteHatJr have stopped putting down my videos. \n\n1.

After this article, Karan Bajaj did give a lame reply over LinkedIn. " *I appreciate that every entrepreneur, just as everyone in the public domain, should be exposed to ruthless scrutiny and public debate. "* BS. He got 16 of my videos removed, 2 YT channels, 2 Reddit accounts, 1 Twitter, 1 Quora. And now he says this. It took me 2 months of constant posting content, getting an article published by Ken, and he just casually ignores the issue. \n4. One of their Sales Director started messaging me, over Linkedin. For all the questions his reply was "hehe or smilies". He didn\'t care for anything. Did not answer a single question and kept laughing. Should I share that chat here? I ended up telling him to FO if he doesn\'t stop messaging me. It doesn\'t have any answers but does show their attitude regarding our questions. Let me know if I should post that chat or not. \n5. One another Director of WhiteHatJr started telling me she will file a case of Harassment over me. Somehow I harassed her. She still hasn\'t answered how I harassed her. \n\nAfter [The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/whitehat-jrs-shades-of-grey/) article: \n\n1. Karan Bajaj again didn\'t reply to the actual answers. Their game plan is that because they are in the education sector, they get to lie and play false advertisements. He talks about his daughter, how she loves coding, totally deflections the questions asked in the article. \n2. \'The article is behind a paywall\': Yes. No one else wants to publish such articles. Many journalists from mainstream media houses (which run on ads) talked to me, and in the very end, they drop the articles. All the work, emails, information that I provide, time that is invested gets wasted. I think we can understand what happens behind the scenes. \n3. We need to corner WhiteHatJr on Linkedin now to make them accountable for their lies and false advertisements.

Russia was in dire straits. At around the same time, India was trying to get Cryogenic Engines from Russia. The value of the deal? $250 million.\n\nThese engines were crucial for Indian Space program. especially to graduate from the PSLVs to GSLVs.\n\nPresident Bush was OK with it. But a democrat senator put in an amendment which stated that IF Russia sold the cryogenic engine to India, this aid package would be scuttled!\n\nRussia badly needed this aid. It had no choice but to back down from the deal it already had with India. \nIn the same period, China was taking technology from Russia by the bushels. The US, indeed this Senator, of course preferred to look the other way.\n\nNot just that, there were numerous attempts of Sabotage of the Indian cryogenic program by some 'interested' foreign agencies. It took years, but India developed its own solution, lynchpining on the little help it had gotten from Russia before the deal was scuttled.\n\nThe senator that scuttled the deal was one JOE BIDEN.\nThe whole issue was covered ina 1992 article of the LA times."<br />Author: 'NaastikaBhakta'<br />id: 'ja1v27'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: "Interesting perspective.

He goes red faced and said why should we divide it, you are in minority and you must go by majority....*\n\n*I said , why did we divide India in 1947, when Muslims were in minority in India. If the minority demand to divide India, was acceded to, then, it should be acceded to, now in the case of Kashmir as well....*\n\nHe went speechless…..\n\n*I said Kashmir is already dived into two, one is with India, and the other part is POK, let all Muslims who want independence go to that part of Kashmir, which you rightly call as Azad Kashmir, as you want Azadi, go and demand independence there from Pakistan and leave the Indian part of Kashmir for Hindus only, at least let this division be complete...*'<br />Author: 'NaastikaBhakta'<br />id: 'ja1uf9'<br />Flair ::Whatsapp: WhatsApp Forward</li><li>Title: 'I would be downvoted to hell for this but seriously someone needed to say this.'<br />Body: "When did our sub become a sub for just hindu extremists.
