Obsolete कहकर आपने खूब मज़ाक उड़ाया !!!  \n\nजूते पहनकर खाने का प्रचलन आपने दूसरे देशों के आसुरी समाज से ग्रहण कर लिया । Buffet system बना दिया ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nउन लोगों का मजाक बनाया जो जूते चप्पल निकालकर भोजन करते थे ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nअरे हमारी कोई भी पूजा , यज्ञ, हवन सब पूरी तरह स्वच्छ होकर , हाथ धोकर करने का प्रावधान है ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nपंडित जी आपको हाथ में जल देकर हस्त प्रक्षालन के लिए बोलते हैं ।आपके ऊपर जल छिड़ककर मंत्र बोलते हैं :-\n\nॐ अपवित्रः पवित्रो वा सर्वावस्थां गतोऽपिवा ।।\n\nयः स्मरेत्पुण्डरीकाक्षं स बाह्यभ्यन्तरः शुचिः ॥\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nॐ पुनातु पुण्डरीकाक्षः पुनातु पुण्डरीकाक्षः पुनातु ।।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nतब भी आपने मजाक उड़ाया ।\n\nजब सनातन धर्मी के यहाँ किसी के घर शिशु का  जन्म होता था तो सूतक लगता था । इस अवस्था में ब्राह्मण 10 दिन , क्षत्रिय 15 दिन , वैश्य 20 दिन और शूद्र 30 दिन तक सबसे अलग रहता है । उसके घर लोग नहीं आते थे , जल तक का सेवन नहीं किया जाता था जब तक उसके घर हवन या यज्ञ से शुद्धिकरण न हो जाये । प्रसूति गृह से माँ और बच्चे को निकलने की मनाही होती थी । माँ कोई भी कार्य नहीं कर सकती थी और न ही भोजनालय में प्रवेश करती थी ।\n\nइसका भी आपने बड़ा मजाक उड़ाया ।।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nये नहीं समझा कि यह बीमारियों से बचने या संक्रमण से बचाव के लिए Quarantine किया जाता था या isolate किया जाता था ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nप्रसूति गृह में माँ और बच्चे के पास निरंतर बोरसी सुलगाई रहती थी जिसमें नीम की पत्ती, कपूर, गुग्गल इत्यादि निरंतर धुँवा दिया जाता था।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nउनको इसलिए नहीं निकलने दिया जाता था क्योंकि उनकी immunity इस दौरान कमज़ोर रहती थी और बाहरी वातावरण से संक्रमण का खतरा रहता था ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nलेकिन आपने फिर पुरानी चीज़ें कहकर इसका मज़ाक उड़ाया और आज देखिये 80% महिलाएँ एक delivery के बाद रोगों का भंडार बन जाती हैं कमर दर्द से लेकर , खून की कमी से लेकर अनगिनत समस्याएं  ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nब्राह्मण , क्षत्रिय , वैश्य , शुद्र के लिए अलग Quarantine या isolation की अवधी इसलिए क्योंकि हर वर्ण का खान पान अलग रहता था , कर्म अलग रहते थे जिससे सभी वर्णों के शरीर की immunity system अलग होता था जो उपरोक्त अवधि में balanced होता था ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nऐसे ही जब कोई मर जाता था तब भी 13 दिन तक उस घर में कोई प्रवेश नहीं करता था । यही Isolation period था । क्योंकि मृत्यु या तो किसी बीमारी से होती है या वृद्धावस्था के कारण जिसमें शरीर तमाम रोगों का घर होता है । यह रोग हर जगह न फैले इसलिए 14 दिन का quarantine period बनाया गया ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nअरे जो शव को अग्नि देता था  या दाग देता था । उसको घर वाले तक नहीं छू सकते थे 13 दिन तक । उसका खाना पीना , भोजन , बिस्तर , कपड़े सब अलग कर दिए जाते थे । तेरहवें दिन शुद्धिकरण के पश्चात , सिर के बाल हटवाकर ही पूरा परिवार शुद्ध होता था ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nतब भी आप बहुत हँसे थे ।  bloody indians कहकर मजाक बनाया था !!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nजब किसी रजस्वला स्त्री को 4 दिन isolation में रखा जाता है ताकि वह भी बीमारियों से बची रहें और आप भी बचे रहें तब भी आपने पानी पी पी कर गालियाँ दी । और नारीवादियों को कौन कहे  , वो तो दिमागी तौर से अलग होती हैं , उन्होंने जो ज़हर बोया कि उसकी कीमत आज सभी स्त्रियाँ तमाम तरह की बीमारियों से ग्रसित होकर चुका रही हैं ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nजब किसी के शव यात्रा से लोग आते हैं घर में प्रवेश नहीं मिलता है और बाहर ही हाथ पैर धोकर स्नान करके , कपड़े वहीं निकालकर घर में आया जाता है ,  इसका भी खूब मजाक उड़ाया आपने ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nआज भी गांवों में एक परंपरा है कि बाहर से कोई भी आता है तो उसके पैर धुलवायें जाते हैं । जब कोई भी बहूं , लड़की या कोई भी दूर से आता है तो वह तब तक प्रवेश नहीं पाता जब तक घर की बड़ी बूढ़ी लोटे में जल लेकर , हल्दी डालकर उस पर छिड़काव करके वही जल बहाती नहीं हों , तब तक । खूब मजाक बनाया था न ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nइन्हीं सवर्णों को और ब्राह्मणों को अपमानित किया था जब ये गलत और गंदे कार्य करने वाले , माँस और चमड़ों का कार्य करने वाले लोगों को तब तक नहीं छूते थे जब तक वह स्नान से शुद्ध न हो जाये ।  ये वही लोग थे जो जानवर पालते थे जैसे सुअर, भेड़ , बकरी , मुर्गा , कुत्ता इत्यादि जो अनगिनत बीमारियाँ अपने साथ लाते थे ।\n\nये लोग जल्दी उनके हाथ का छुआ जल या भोजन नहीं ग्रहण करते थे तब बड़ा हो हल्ला आपने मचाया और इन लोगों को इतनी गालियाँ दी कि इन्हें अपने आप से घृणा होने लगी ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nयही वह गंदे कार्य करने वाले लोग थे जो प्लेग , TB , चिकन पॉक्स , छोटी माता , बड़ी माता , जैसी जानलेवा बीमारियों के संवाहक थे ,और जब आपको बोला गया कि बीमारियों से बचने के लिए आप इनसे दूर रहें तो आपने गालियों का मटका इनके सिर पर फोड़ दिया और इनको इतना अपमानित किया कि इन्होंने बोलना छोड़ दिया और समझाना छोड़ दिया ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nआज जब आपको किसी को छूने से मना किया जा रहा है तो आप इसे ही विज्ञान बोलकर अपना रहे हैं । Quarantine किया जा रहा है तो आप खुश होकर इसको अपना रहे हैं ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nजब शास्त्रों ने बोला था तो ब्राह्मणवाद बोलकर आपने गरियाया था और अपमानित किया था ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nआज यह उसी का परिणति है कि आज पूरा विश्व इससे जूझ रहा है ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nयाद करिये पहले जब आप बाहर निकलते थे तो आप की माँ आपको जेब में कपूर या हल्दी की गाँठ इत्यादि देती थी रखने को ।\n\nयह सब कीटाणु रोधी होते हैं।\n\nशरीर पर कपूर पानी का लेप करते थे ताकि सुगन्धित भी रहें और रोगाणुओं से भी बचे रहें ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nलेकिन सब आपने भुला दिया ।।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nआपको तो अपने शास्त्रों को गाली देने में और ब्राह्मणों को अपमानित करने में , उनको भगाने में जो आनंद आता है शायद वह परमानंद आपको कहीं नहीं मिलता ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nअरे मूढो !! अपने शास्त्रों के level के जिस दिन तुम हो जाओगे न तो यह देश विश्व गुरु कहलायेगा ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nतुम ऐसे अपने शास्त्रों पर ऊँगली उठाते हो जैसे कोई मूर्ख व्यक्ति के मूर्ख 7 वर्ष का बेटा ISRO के कार्यों पर प्रश्नचिन्ह लगाए ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nअब भी कहता हूँ अपने शास्त्रों का सम्मान करना सीखो । उनको मानो  ।  बुद्धि में शास्त्रों की अगर कोई बात नहीं घुस रही है तो समझ जाओ आपकी बुद्धि का स्तर उतना नहीं हुआ है । उस व्यक्ति के पास जाओ जो तुम्हे शास्त्रों की बातों को सही ढंग से समझा सके ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nअरे कुछ भी हो मुझसे ही पूछ लिया करो शायद मैं ही कुछ मदद कर दूँ । लेकिन गाली मत दो , उसको जलाने  का दुष्कृत्य मत करो ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nआपको बता दूँ कि आज जो जो Precautions बरते जा रहे हैं , मनुस्मृति उठाइये , उसमें सभी कुछ एक एक करके वर्णित है ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nलेकिन आप पढ़ते कहाँ हैं , दूसरे मूढो की बातों में आकर प्रश्नचिन्ह उठायेंगे और उन्हें जलाएंगे\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nयह पोस्ट वैसे ही लम्बी हो गयी है अन्यथा वह सारी बातें यहाँ श्लोक सहित डालता ।\n\nकाश एक platform मिलता और mic मिल जाता तो घण्टों घण्टों बोलता और आपको एक एक अवयव से रूबरू करवाता और पूरी तरह वैज्ञानिक दृष्टिकोण लेकर\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nक्योंकि जिसने विज्ञान का गहन अध्ययन किया होगा , वह शास्त्र वेद पुराण इत्यादि की बातों को बड़े ही आराम से समझ सकता है , corelate कर सकता है और समझा भी सकता है ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nभले अभी इस निकृष्ट / वैश्विक संविधान की आप लोग दुहाई दे रहे हों ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nलेकिन मेरी यह बात स्वर्ण अक्षरों में लिख लीजिये कि मनुस्मृति से सर्वश्रेष्ठ विश्व में कोई संविधान नहीं बना है और एक दिन पूरा विश्व इसी मनुस्मृति संविधान को लागू कर इसका पालन करेगा ।\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote it down !! Mark my words again !! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nमुझे आप गालियाँ दे सकते हैं । \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nमुझे नहीं पता कि आप इतनी लंबी पोस्ट पढ़ेंगे या नहीं लेकिन मेरा काम है आप लोगों को जगाना , जिसको जगना है या लाभ लेना है वह पढ़ लेगा ।\n\nयह भी अनुरोध करता हूँ कि सभी  ब्राह्मण बनिये ( भले आप किसी भी जाति से हों ) और  ब्राह्मणत्व का पालन कीजिये इससे इहलोक और परलोक दोनों  सुधरेगा...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nसर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनःसवेँसनतु निरामया:, जय महादेव \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nसाभार ब्राह्मण शास्त्रार्थ ग्रुप'<br />Author: 'godfatherezio'<br />id: 'gf2pxe'<br />Flair :WhatsApp Forward</li>

<li>Title: 'Sanskrit- The viable alternate to English as connector language'<br />Body: "Listen up Mahajans,\n\nSanskrit's glory has been a subject of scholarly debate in not just Virat Hindu circles but also even in staunchest Internationalist discussions. It is without a doubt was one of the most classical invention of Ancient India, probably of entire Ancient history.\nThere are manuscripts in museum and libraries all around the world which are yet to be compiled owing to the vastness of it.\nIt has influenced people from Thoreau and Mueller to Twain, Oppenheimer and Mendeleev.\n\nBut my idea is of realizing it as the connector language of India. Supporting arguments:\n1. It will help us reconnect with Our roots and understand the multi layered philosophy of Dharma more appropriately.\n2. It is directly connected to all Uttarpath languages: Hindi, Bengali, Dogri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Assamese, Odia, and even Urdu. \n3. It is indirectly connected to 2/4 Dakshinpath languages to a very high degree. Tamil and Malayalm also have words from Sanskrit in their lexicon but the verbs(main building blocks of language) are non Sanskritic. \n4. It works well with the 2 language argument for all states. One local language and one national language. \n5. It was initially written in Brahmi, which is the mother of all scripts of India from Himalaya to Indian ocean(except Urdu), and of South East Asia. Thai, Laotian, Burmese, are to varying degrees have their scripts made from Brahmi. Brahmi can become Our connector script.\n\n\nNow the biggest issue: Scientific terminologies. \n\nMost of the scientific discoveries and technological advancement happened in West which made sure all chemicals, rocks, machines, are derived from them.\n\nA lot of them have words in Sanskrit like \nSurgery: Shalya-chikitsa\nMedicine: Aushadhi\nPhysician: Vaidya\nPhysics: Bhotiki\nChemistry: Rasayaniki, Rasayan Shastra\n\nBut these are quite inadequate.\nEspecially for things like Biological and Chemical nomenclature\nNow two path arise, \n1. We can directly write English terms in Sanskrit with same cognates. \n2. We can follow Chinese example and make Our own terms for it. They have completely rejected the Latin scheme of Biological names and made Mandarin terms for it but taking inspiration from them.\nSo, Mango = Mangifera Indika. Here Mangifera is genus name and Indika is species name(derived from Latin term for India)\n\nIt can become something like Aamram Bharatye\nCow - Bos Indika- Gau Bharatye\n\nNow remain biggest challenge area: Chemical nomenclature.\n\n\nWhat words can really replace say: Mitochondria or Diethyl Phosphate. \n\nIt is such a large area of cultural research that even 1 million Indians are not enough to explore it.\nChinese have done tremendous job in doing it. They only use Chinese derived terms for eveything, from Chemical, disease to sub atomic particles.\n\nWe can also make it happen, owing to the vast fluidity and vocabulary of Sanskrit. \n\nI am putting it out there for your thinking. Feel free to comment and criticize. It sounds ridiculous but if we ever wish to establish a Dharmic society, language must take great precedence."<br />Author: 'helmuthxz'<br />id: 'gcxcsa'<br />Flair :Research</li>

SAGARMALA PROJECT (OCEAN NECKLACE)**\n\n* It is an initiative by the government of India to enhance the performance of the country\'s logistics sector.  \n*  The Sagarmala Programme is the flagship programme of the Ministry of Shipping to promote port-led development in the country by exploiting India’s 7,500 km long coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways and its strategic location on key international maritime trade routes. \n\n![img](g4losm0wygw41)\n\n![img](8kdtjpeyygw41)\n\n**2. BHARATMALA PROJECT**\n\n*  It is a centrally-sponsored and funded road and highways project of the GOI. \n*  The total investment for 83,677 km (51,994 mi) committed new highways is estimated at ₹5.35 lakh crore (US$77 billion), making it the single largest outlay for a government road construction scheme. \n\n![img](jnct22281hw41)\n\n![video](b3ji66ub1hw41)\n\n **3. Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC)** \n\n* 23 industrial hubs, 24 smart cities, two power plants, six airports, two ports and a six-lane expressway stretching 1,500km connecting the industrial cities of Delhi and Mumbai\n* time to transport goods from Delhi factories to shipping ports will reduce from 14 days to 14 hours\n* expected to create 25 million jobs in 7 years\n* one of the world’s largest infrastructure project with total project cost of $100 billion. Phase 1 planned to be completed by 2019\n\n![img](ix1m47y63hw41)\n\n![img](88181c1a5hw41)\n\n**4. A BOON FOR JAMMU AND KASHMIR- ZOJILA TUNNEL**\n\n* The Zoji La tunnel will be the longest bi-directional road tunnel in Asia. Its construction period will be five years because of a very difficult terrain where in some areas the temperature drops to minus 45 degree Celsius.\n* Planned as a smart tunnel, it will have the latest safety features such as fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply, emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs, traffic logging equipment and tunnel radio system.\n* The civil construction cost of the project is Rs.49 billion. The total capital cost of the project is Rs.68 billion. It includes the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years.\n* Defense forces have to face a hard time ensuring supplies to border posts during winters across Zoji La pass which is most strategic for the entire Kargil sector which has seen intrusion and war in the past. The tunnel will help keep the highway open the entire year.\n\n![img](ls428gg35hw41)\n\n**5. Mumbai Ahmedabad Bullet Train:**\n\n* 508km high speed track, including 7km undersea tunnel\n* train speed of 320km/h, will reduce travel time between business-critical cities of Mumbai and Ahmedabad from 7 hrs to 2 hrs\n* planned to be operational by 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](aky3w2v86hw41)\n\n![video](99xlu3ka6hw41)\n\n**6 By Far the most Ambitious project- The E-highway project of India**\n\n* The Indian Government is planning to trial an electric highway (e-highway) on the proposed Delhi-Mumbai expressway within the next three years to boost electric mobility in the country. \n* Gadkari said: “Trucks of 80t will be deployed and these will have electric cable to draw power from the overhead cable network. There will be two tracks and trucks with containers can run at 100km/h.\n* “The trucks will run on electricity for 20km and the battery will get charged to run on stretches where there is no overhead wire. Again, after some kilometres, these can tap the overhead wire and simultaneously get charged again while running.”\n\n![img](58qbqj0q7hw41)\n\n# TOURISM:\n\n**1.

Fund our work**](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)**!**\n\nTl;dr\n\nToday, we sent a[ joint representation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3/view?usp=sharing)  to the Prime Minister\'s Office that is endorsed by 45 organisations and  more than 100 individuals against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu  App dated May 1, 2020. This joint representation becomes all the more  urgent given yesterday\'s [direction by the Home Ministry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXzfI9uPv0Qr4YZBKXwk_1Z1M2skYfzl/view?usp=sharing)  for the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu and for it\'s "100% coverage"  especially in all workplaces. Violation of this direction can lead to  criminal penalties thereby Aarogya Setu now not only impacts the data  privacy of workers, or can lead to risks of exclusion and  misidentification, a person not having it on their phone can also be  charged with a criminal offence. This marks a dramatic and clear shift  in government policy on Aarogya Setu from, "encouragement" towards  coercion and increases the legitimacy of the demands articulated by the  joint representation.\n\nA joint representation co-signed by 45 organisations and more than 100 people\n\nIn [yesterday\'s post](https://internetfreedom.in/workers-privacy-during-covid-19/)  we released a joint representation signed by 37 organisations and 75  individuals against mandating the use of the Aarogya Setu on workers.  After we opened it for further sign-ons this number has grown to 45  organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed  solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on workers.  The endorsements are from a broad swathe of Indian society including  trade unions, people\'s movements, digital rights organizations, public  health experts, former civil servants and bureaucrats, activists,  academics, technologists, journalists, lawyers etc.\n\nA copy of the [joint representation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3)  was sent today with a covering letter to the Prime Minister\'s Office  with a copy to Ministry of Home Affairs and other central government  ministries.\n\nTo this we attached [a covering letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RR3tBnJCSkQvSDp0uVcMQr6C2RILgqg4/view?usp=sharing)  dated May 2, 2020 which further notes with concern yesterday evening\'s  development of the issuance of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) has been  issued on May 1, 2020 around 6:00 PM by the Ministry of Home Affairs  requiring mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu. This goes against the  core demands of the joint representation which is attached to this  covering letter.\n\nAarogya Setu : Not only mandatory but also criminal penalties\n\nThe  Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), which has been issued under Section  10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates for the mandatory  installation and operation of Aarogya Setu in two specific ways:\n\n1. First,  after classification of the districts into three zones, for the Red  (Hotspots) Zones, a further sub-classification has been made for, “*containment zones*”. As per the Order under Section 3(iii), “*The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones*”.\n2. Second, at Para 15(i) further reference is made for, “*all the district magistrates*” to, “*strictly enforce the lockdown measures*” for, “*public and workplaces, as specified in Annexure I*”. This direction extends to all three zones. Annexure I further states at Point No. 15 that, “*Use  of Aarogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both  private and public. It shall be responsibility of the Head of the  respective Organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among  employees*”.\n\nPresently  here are no exceptions or conditionality provided in these directions  which place emphasis on 100% coverage in effect meaning total and  complete mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu for all workers, all  across the country. The order further indicates criminal penalties for  non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, “*Any  person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives  for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per  the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,  besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal  provisions as applicable*”. The specific provision that may be  attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is  Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for  disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life.  The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6  months imprisonment.\n\nHence, the  mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu is not only an issue of data  privacy but second order harms which spring from it now includes loss of  urban mobility, use of public spaces and transit, livelihood and  personal liberty for millions of Indians all over India. Specially those  without smartphones devices given the lack of any exemption categories.\n\nIntention for further action\n\nWe  at IFF in continuation of this Joint Representation dated May 1, 2020  and through this covering letter have requested specific review of Order  No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) and will also be shortly reaching out to each one  of the co-signees and collaborators urging them to send individual  letters of concern as much as examine further advocacy actions against  this grave breach.\n\nWe also remain  open to any suggestions and advice on what we can do better, or  different not only through our collaborators, but even members of the  public. We invite you to write to us, or discuss these issues over at  the [Internet Freedom Forum](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).\n\nAs  stated before we at IFF will continue conducting public advocacy,  awareness especially through digital media as well as continue to engage  pro-actively with all government institutions on the issues concerning  Aarogya Setu. This includes representations, RTI requests as well as  other legal remedies which may be examined at an appropriate stage in  consultation with IFF\'s legal team and several lawyers who continue to  volunteer thier time and labour towards protecting fundamental rights.\n\nWe  remain committed working with more organisations and individuals to  broaden the scope and improve the impact of interventions around Aarogya  Setu. Please do feel free to reach out to us.\n\nImportant Documents\n\n1.

Since 1978, it helped create an estimated seven million jobs and the city’s GDP grew 50 times to $180 billion after the development of ports.\n*  If Indian port development takes off similarly, local and foreign funds would flow in and coastal regions may become good bets for real estate too, as they will see industry and job growth can also help the Centre spend on development and possibly reduce taxes.\n\nLaunched in: 2016 Expected completion: 2022\n\n***2.BharatMala***\n\n \n\n* 35,000km highways across 16 states, including 9,000km of economic corridors\n* intended to improve connectivity, enable faster movement of goods, create 22 million jobs and decrease supply chain costs from the current average 18% to 6% \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/gcavln/video/dde0zj7adcw41/player\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhlvkzyvccw41.jpg?width=696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77773b00a6964e36cdc9f2ba3c6eef80dbf61c57\n\nLaunched: 2015   Expected: 2022\n\n \n\n***3.

Its construction period will be five years because of a very difficult terrain where in some areas the temperature drops to minus 45 degree Celsius.\n* The project aims at construction of 14.2\xa0km long two-lane bi-directional single tube tunnel with a parallel 14.2\xa0km long egress tunnel. The western portal is at [Baltal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltal,_Jammu_and_Kashmir) at about 3,000\xa0m altitude (about 400\xa0m lower than the altitude of the existing highway there), about 15\xa0km east of Sonmarg. The eastern portal after Zoji La is at Minamarg towards the Dras / Kargil end. The length of the tunnel does not include the lengths of the approach roads to both ends of the tunnel from the existing highway.\n* Planned as a smart tunnel, it will have the latest safety features such as fully transverse ventilation system, uninterrupted power supply, emergency lighting, CCTV monitoring, variable message signs, traffic logging equipment and tunnel radio system.\n* The safety features will include emergency telephones and fire-fighting cabinets at every 125 metre, pedestrian cross-passages at every 250 metre and motorable cross passages and lay-bye at every 750 metre.\n* The civil construction cost of the project is Rs.49 billion. The total capital cost of the project is Rs.68 billion. It includes the cost of land, resettlement and rehabilitation and other pre-construction activities as well as maintenance and operation cost of the tunnel for four years.\n* Defense forces have to face a hard time ensuring supplies to border posts during winters across Zoji La pass which is most strategic for the entire Kargil sector which has seen intrusion and war in the past.

Don't be aggressive, if someone replies in anger or a derogatory manner, ignore him or just give him the \\*hands folded\\* emoji, some people will try to provoke you by using wrong facts or misinterpretations of facts .Remember, the aim is to spread awareness about our own culture to people who are willing to learn about it or people who aren't really keen but wouldn't mind learning about it. Unfortunately there will be some people who are so brainwashed that they wouldn't care even if you post the greatest archaeological findings from our culture, so just don't mind them. You don't know how much effect this is going to have in long term. Instead of posting polarizing content, keep it subtle.\n\nThe reason the content should not be polarizing is that many of you might be having jobs/careers which might be affected badly if you post hard-hitting Hindutva content. But posting about your own culture instead of demonizing the others is better, since no one can then accuse you of being a bigot etc.\n\nAssuming that chodi has about 1k regular members and about half of them use social media regularly,  if 400-500 people share these posts daily, subconsciously, there will slowly develop a sense of enlightenment and attachment towards our Sanatani culture.\n\nIn short: Read title."<br />Author: 'PotentialBattle'<br />id: 'gc298f'<br />Flair :Virat Hindu</li>

Just because SOME of us look mongoloid doesnt mean everyone is (particaullary the brahmins). We won\'t even sit down to eat with the mongoloids over there let alone marry them. Also, why does every onw hink that we ran away from the Muslim invasions? There are many upper caste people in Uttarakhand because we simply are not natives and were imported from Kannauj and West UP by the Hindu Katyuri and Chand kings to serve as administrators, priests, etc, etc. Only several families came from Rajasthan or Maharatshtra, and that too in the 1800s. Also, why does every mainland indian think we "intermarried" with the locals. I swear every anthropology forum users always classify people from Uttrakhand( even the brahmins) as "tibetid influenced" even if they look completely cuacassian or Desi (I even have seen people say Anushka Sharma looks East Asian). WHY? BRAHMINS DIDN\'T MARRY THOSE MONGOLOIDS OVER THERE FFS. We don\'t even want to associate with Tharus or Kirats or whatever, we would rather be south Indian than mongoloid. Just look at this website claiming us to be from the Plains and Maharatshtra : [https://dpuckjo8.wixsite.com/kumaon](https://dpuckjo8.wixsite.com/kumaon) . And just becuase Harish Rawat looks asian doesn\'t mean anything. He is a rajput, and the rajputs married local wives as they were not as strict marriage wise. I mean, just look at how strictly brahmins marry (especially in my Moms side) . Do you think we would marry with non brahmins (Mongoloids)? \n\nSo please, quit claiming that we (or at least us pahari Brahmans) look "chinese".

They seem to be a couple of weeks away from saying that one of Rajiv Gandhi’s dreams was that India would never have a Bullet Train?\n\nIf MMS took himself seriously as an economist, he would know that in times of recession, it is for the government to spend money on large public projects.\n\nIndeed, when the Great Depression hit the United States in 1929, the government put people to work as part of a massive public works program. This came to be known as the “New Deal.” Under the formidable Franklin D Roosevelt, the US government created the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1933. The PWA completed some of the most iconic infrastructure projects in the US, including the legendary Hoover Dam. The infrastructure that the US created in that decade laid the foundation of the post WW2 boom when the US began a 70 year reign as the world’s pre-eminent economic, military and industrial power\n\nIn fact, the economic crisis triggered by the Wuhan Coronavirus could be the moment for India to launch its own “New Deal.” This is the time to build those bullet trains, dams and super highways that could last us for several generations.\n\nAnd considering that the bullet train is financed with a near interest free loan from Japan, it’s a no brainer.\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine why the Congress is so obsessed with scrapping the Bullet Train and Central Vista. They are probably worried that India might end up with landmarks on which they won’t be able to stick the names of their one great dynasty. With no workers, no organization skills and no ideology, the Congress is just a brand name. Without everything being called “Jawahar this” or “Indira that” or “Rajiv Gandhi XYZ,” the Congress would have to shut down.\n\nIt’s bad enough that the Congress is being taunted for spending its decades in power allocating Bharat Ratnas rather than building toilets. What if tomorrow India has a bullet train and nobody gives credit to Rajiv Gandhi for dreaming it up? What would the Congress do then?\n\nBeware!'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'gbom93'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>
<li>Title: "How the Demon possesses someone's body and mind."<br />Body: "Disclaimer: Long Post, have something to eat, and relax.\n\nSo recently I was watching the movie called Conjuring( 2013) in this movie there was a scene in which Ed Warren( one of the character) was giving a lecture on Demonic possession at a University, he says that each Demonic possession has three stages Infestation, Oppression, and Possession. I believe that the same analogy could be used for a Liberandu whose mind and body have been possessed by the Demon called Liberandunism, which an amalgam of pseudo-liberalism, pseudo-secularism, communism, hate for his country, Dharma and culture.\n\nInfestation which is the first stage where the victim( Liberandu) is introduced with the subtle Communist propaganda in the form of pop culture, education system, and social media. The Demon( Liberandunism) is so sly that it doesn't even show its presence but it is present everywhere. The demon preys on the most psychologically vulnerable beings, people who have no understanding of Dharma and the rich Indian culture and history, people who are politically ignorant. And once the demon gets its prey we would have our next stage, i.e. Oppression.\n\nIn Oppression the victim's mind is further filled with filth by the fellow Demon's worshippers( Liberandus). The Demon tries to break the will of the victim by giving him false theories viz Aryan Invasion Theory, How Muslims are our brother theory, How Brahmins have oppressed us theory, How great is Communism and bad is Capitalism theory etc. While the Demon is playing its game our victim would start showing the early signs of possession, he will start watching the videos of Dhruv Rathee, he will start following the Feministflowercrown, Sanitarypanels, fuckBJP, etc on Instagram. On Twitter, his favorite handles will be Rana Ayyub, Nidhi Razdan, Kunal Kamra, Swara Bhaskar, etc. These are the same people who have been previously possessed by the Demon and now the Demon will use the same possessed individuals to get more recruits. The victim could also be seen reading the works of Karl Marx and other communists, he could also be seen admiring Zakir Naik. The victim will start showing interest in Adharmic cultures and will start using phrases like Mudi bad reeee, Saffron Fascism reeee, RSS Conspiracy reeee. By the end of this stage, the victim will start shivering whenever someone who is not possessed starts giving his opinion or showing him the truth, which brings to us our third and final stage the Possession.\n\nNow in the Possession stage, the victim is now completely possessed by the demon, and just like a person possessed by the real demon stays away from anything which is Godly or Dharmic or Holy in the same way Liberandu will stay away from anything closely different from his demonic opinion. He won't participate in Poojas, starts criticizing and mocking Sanatani Gods, starts eating beef, or talks about eating beef. He would also start participating in Devil rituals like Anti CAA protests and starts singing Adharmic songs like the poem of Faiz. If you bring him inside a Temple or a dharmic place he will start showing the signs of withdrawal and will start shivering. Showing him the correct news and facts is like showing a possessed person a picture of Lord Hanuman. Words like RSS, IT Cell, Bhakt, Hindu Fascist, Nazi, Zionist, etc will become his constant companion. By this stage, it is too late to bring him back and now the Demon will use him to recruit more Liberandus.\n\nThe Demon is now everywhere, it has occupied each and every social media space and with each day with more and more recruits it is becoming more and more powerful. It is the Dharma of Virats( Demonologists) to end this menace of this Demon."<br />Author: 'PeshwaBajiraoBallal'<br />id: 'gbi5lz'<br />Flair :Research</li>

It was photo of excavations of 9200 years old skeleton recently found in Serbia. It was special because the posture of that skeleton looked just like a yogi had taken mahasamdhi!\n\n**Now this had NOTHING at all to do with politics and was purely ARCHAEOLOGY!**\n\nHe made a very vulgur comment on that. I ignored and then I posted few other archaelogical/historical proofs of ancient India in the group (e.g. 3000 year old pipeline recently found in Gujarat, Ramayana proofs, etc.\n\nHe was pissed once again and here\'s the biggest joke. He said and I quote, **"This is an RSS conspiracy"!**\n\n**Can u fking believe that?**\n\nWhen I asked how did he come to that conclusion, he obviously had no answers. He seemed very frustrated but couldn\'t call me bhakt or sanghi as the posts were absolutely non political.\n\n**So here\'s the new strategy:**\n\nBURN THE FKING LIBRANDS WITH MORE ARHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL PROOFS!\n\nPour ancient Indian content on their head so much that it must haunt them in their dreams and they can\'t stop themselves but believe it.\n\nNow I\'ve even started posted about true indology\'s - Akbar and Birbal Stories are fake, Akbar had 300 wives and none of them was Jodha or my personal research on 32,000 year old Dwarka excavations found, Kailasa Temple architecture, etc and he has been burning like nothing else. And he can\'t even call me out.\n\nI fking love this strategy.\n\n**1 tir se 2 nishan**\n\nSo I request all of you to take time and post archaeological and historical proofs of the ancient hindu civilization in your whatsapp groups, stories, instagram, etc.\n\nNobody is going to call you a bhakt or sanghi.\n\nAnd if someone asks why you \'suddenly\' started posting this kind of stuff, then say "I came acorss Praveen Mohan on YouTube or may be TrueIndology on twitter and ancient Archaeology fascinates me!"\n\nGO BURN!\n\nHar Har Mahadev.'<br />Author: 'johnkarter767612'<br />id: 'gar5g7'<br />Flair :Research</li>

<li>Title: 'Ithihas Time : When Lord Brahma guarded the stage to protect freedom of Speech and Expression'<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource : Natyashastra written by Bharatmuni.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story is the time of Treta-yuga, under the King Vaivasvata, people fell prey to lust, greed, jealousy and anger. Hence their pleasures became admixed with sorrow, their happiness with misery. A delegation, led by lndra, was formed in Jambudvipa to represent Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Urugas and human beings who inhabited it to seek a remedy. The delegation felt that a universal, diverting entertainment within the authorization or conformity of the Veda was the answer, and approached the creator god Brahma to create for them such an audio-visual art mode. Accordingly, Brahma created the art of the theatre, Natya from the four Vedas eclectically and gave it to them.  \n\n\n The task was then delegated by Brahma to the sage Bharata who, with his 'sons' playing the different roles, produced a play on the theme of Amritamanthana (churning of the milk ocean for obtaining the immortalizing elixir) highlighting the triumph of gods over demons. He dramatized a theme in which the gods vanquished the demons and tore them limb to limb. The play was performed; Brahma and the other gods were delighted. So were Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas and Pannagas. However, when it came to the part when the danavas and daityas were massacred, they (who had gate-crashed) could not stomach the humiliation. They instigated and let loose on the stage obstructive, malevolent spirits which with witchcraft paralyzed all activity on the stage and struck the actors and even the director dumb. Indra discovered the reason for this thespian calamity, seized the banner staff itself and beat to a pulp the invisible obstructive forces (vighnas) and their leader Virupaksha as well as the daityas and danavas who had aided and abetted. Then the play went on smoothly. The gods were pleased, offered gifts to the performers and the director. For at the next performance, the remaining Vighnas again terrorized the dramatis personae and brought the play to a stop. To counter this various gods were assigned the task of safeguarding the players and also various parts of the stage. Brahma himself took over the protection of the stage.  'It is for this reason that flowers are scattered on the stage (Pushpanjali) the beginning of a performance.'"<br />Author: 'sharmaji_ka_CA'<br />id: 'g9qifq'<br />Flair :Research</li>

I have a black brown complexion. I always get lucky when it comes to sex. And most of the times its with gorimems. This has made me feel more attracted towards gorimem but sex is sex. I hope you guys loved my first story about how I got to fuck my hot and sexy InternetOfficer mother\nLet’s s come to story. When I had a semester end break for a month I and my friends had planned to go on a trekking trip. It was supposed to be a four day trek. And the place we decided to go was Ooty. We reached Ooty on the evening of the day before trekking. We checked in at a hotel in the locality. I went to get Tea for us. When I got out of our room I saw a beautiful lady playing with her kid outside their room. I saw her and gave a smile and she too smiled. I left from there to get tea. I was recalling her in my mind. She was fair enough, a height of around 5ft. 8inch, very slim and curvy body profile. South Indian dressing style with a yellow saree. In total a total sex goddess.\nI came back from the canteen and she was still out there with her kid. Again we both smiled. I told, “Hi!, I am Bank_Holidays Shia Tamil guy.” She told,”I am Priya, and this is my son InternetOfficer.” I waved a hi to the kid. She asked me,” Have you come on a tour with your family.” I replied, “No, I and my Tamil boys have come on a trekking trip”. I then called out my friends and introduced them to her. She too introduced me to her group. Now I say “her group” and not family because she hadn’t come with her husband, but only her kid. She called her friends out and said, “this is my friend Anitha and her husband Pradeep and their two kids”. I asked, “didn’t your husband come along?”. She replied, “no, he is busy with his job, always busy”. Then one of my friends asked them to join us in dinner to which they agreed. We went back to our respective rooms then.\nIt was 8pm when me and my friends knocked on their room door. They were all set and we left for a restaurant near by. On the way my friends were talking to each other. Priya aunty’s friend was busy with her family, so Priya aunty was alone. I went to her and asked, “why didn’t her husband come?”. She said, “i told you, he has some important job at his office, he rarely spends some time with us”. I asked, “not even on a tour so far from home”. She replied, “let’s put this matter aside. So, what do you do?”. “I do bakchodi”, I replied. She said, ” Oh! Good. Am just a house wife”. With a cheeky smile I said, “I have great respect for house wives, they are hard working, loving and very good”. She smiled like she was being appreciated for the first time in years.\nWe finally reached the restaurant and me and my friends sat on one side of a table and Priya aunty and her friends sat on the other side. My friends were busy deciding what to order. During this time I was checking out Priya aunty. She wore a red saree, a matching blouse and very light jewelry. She had a really great abs curvy body. The curve on her hips could not be compared to anyone. Her boobs were huge and shaped so well. When she got up to go to the wash I checked out her ass. There were so huge and curvy. I was wondering how could her husband not spend enough time with such a beautiful sweet woman. I wanted to have sex with her so badly. Our food was served and we were eating. I was staring at Priya aunty’s boobs now and then. She suddenly saw me staring at her boobs. I didn’t realize she was watching me until a few seconds. When i did realize I got scared and immediately broke my stare. I was feeling bad that she might feel I was taking advantage of her.\nWe were done with our dinner and were walking to the hotel back. On the way me and Priya aunty were silent until she decided to ask me, “were you staring at what I think you were staring at?”. I was stuck, ” no i wasn’t staring at… I mean i don’t know what your talking about”. She said in a calm voice, “don’t worry relax, am not angry, many men stare at me. I hate them for it. But I liked the way you were staring at me”. I was shocked as well as happy. I asked, “you like me staring at you?, then do you like me Priya?”. She didn’t say anything but blushed. This was the submission. We reached our hotel and I told my friends that I’ll go to the terrace and asked Priya also to give some excuse and come to the terrace.\nI was waiting for her in the terrace. It was a semi open terrace with lights. But now it was all alone. I thought to myself that it was an awesome location. She then entered the terrace. We both were staring at each other not knowing what to do. I then asked her, “You still didn’t answer me, do you like me?”. She replied, “I left my kid, my friends and all just to be with you here alone, don’t you understand”. I didn’t wait for a second I hugged her and kissed her naval. I moved my lips to her face and started giving it kisses in a teasing manner. She was liking it and could not wait for it, so she pulled my face and locked her lips with mine. We were fondling with each other’s mouths. The kiss was so wet and sweet. We explored our mouths for over 15 minutes. My hands were eager to cup her breasts. I started to rub her boobs\neven now in a teasing manner. She was giving me ecstatic looks. I finally caught them with a strong grasp. She moaned, “Ah, Bank_Holidays”. I removed the saree and blouse and she wearing a white bra. Her huge cleave made me more horny. I just ripped her bra off. She giggled and told, “you naughty boy, your very excited”. I caught those huge melons and squeezed them so hard. Her nipples were hard and was rubbing them. I buried my half mouth into her breasts and started sucking it. Her body started shaking heavily and her moans grew loud. She suddenly caught my dick over my track pant and stated jerking it. It was time I reveal my dick to her. I removed my shirt and track pant\nand I don’t wear undies at night. So there I stood with my eight inch dick hard as a rock. Also my dick is curved. She saw my dick and said, “wow, you have such a big and curved thing”. I was wondering why does the curve intrigue her so much. I couldn’t wait to ask her, I continued to suck her boobs and she caught my dick and started jerking it.\nI wanted to see her naked and so I undressed her completely. She had little hairy pussy. I made her lie on the floor and started to lick her navel. Then I moved down to her cunt. It was already so wet. The minute my mouth touched her pussy lips she gave a huge moan. I got excited by this and started to increase the pressure slowly. Her body started shaking hardly and then I understood she was about to come. I started to finger her hard and came all over my hands. I licked the juices in her pussy. She told me, “this is my first oral sex, my husband would never do it because he felt it was disgusting”. I knew what I had to do. I got up and gave her my dick. She slowly licked it like a lollipop. I couldn’t control it, I pushed my dick deep into her mouth. She started sucking it so hard I started moaning like a girl. Suddenly my dick felt a high blood rush and I knew I was about to cum. She knew and increased the speed and I finally came inside her mouth. She drank it all.\nI was so energized by the blowjob. I made her sit in doggy position and pushed my dick into her pussy. I was moving in and out slowly, then increasing the speed slowly. She was moaning, “ah Bank_Holidays, ohhh.. Aahh ahh..”. I was about to come and so was she. She came a few seconds before me. I then was about to come and then I pulled my dick out and came on her ass. Then we did it again.\nAfter few hours of lying naked on the floor and staring at stars she again gave me a blowjob. We then got dressed and left for our room. Next day our paths separated. But we did exchange numbers and we often have phone sex.'<br />Author: 'BanksLuvsTurbovirgin'<br />id: 'g8xhwp'<br />Flair :HQ Text Bakchodi</li>

<li>Title: 'Controversial: Tired of posts discouraging and promoting certain religions?? Have something about our politics! and how our secularity is being ruined. (DO NOT OPEN THIS IF YOU WILL BE OFFENDED WITH YOUR EXTREMIST IDEALS)'<br />Body: ' \n\nAt home and abroad, one of postindependence India’s defining characteristics is that the nation has managed to sustain democratic governance in the face of striking ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity. In the early years after independence, the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the ruling Indian National Congress (or Congress Party) advocated for an Indian brand of secularism designed to hold the country’s disparate communities together under one roof. Indeed, Nehru often pronounced that India’s composite culture was one of its greatest strengths. The Hindu nationalists who later came to populate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its various ideological affiliates have consistently harbored a starkly different view; they envision India as a majoritarian nation-state, not a multicultural one. The tensions inherent in these competing visions of Indian nationhood have come to the fore in recent years, especially since the BJP’s landmark electoral victory in 2014.\n\nTo understand these dynamics, it is necessary to define basic concepts and review relevant history. This is because political entrepreneurs who promote ethnoreligious identities—especially Hindu nationalist ideologues—have created much confusion around the notion of secularism, claiming that its proponents have endeavored to make the state hostile or indifferent to religion. That was certainly not the intention of the architects of modern India, whose enemy was not religion, but communalism.\n\nNationalist forces aside, all is not well with Indian secularism. Even before Hindutva forces began attacking India’s secular tradition, the Congress Party had already started undermining secularism by cynically jockeying for the support of different voting blocs and by stoking divisive issues of social identity (a practice known as vote banking). In parallel, the judiciary—especially at the lower levels—has adopted a majoritarian undertone on certain controversial cases. Whether secularism can maintain its hold as a defining ideology for the country will depend in part on a combination of political forces—namely the BJP’s future electoral success and the strategies the opposition adopts to counter the ruling party.'<br />Author: 'SNUBB3D'<br />id: 'g892kz'<br />Flair :Rant</li>

To give a short description, QNet is an MLM which has been banned in many countries, has several FIRs against its members in various cities of India and operates like your standard MLM - you join by paying a hefty amount, then you bring more people under you who go on to do the same and so on. They have some fancy, luxurious products which are heavily overpriced (20 green tea teabags for Rs.1500, 500 ml honey for Rs.1000, etc etc).\n\nNow he has had a tough time during since 2018, I’ll give him that. He first lost his well paying government job due to some fraud allegations, for which he had to haemorrhage money like anything to keep his name out of FIR, chargesheet, etc etc (This is what my family and I were told while loaning money from us. I don’t know whether the charges were true, if the money really went for paying the lawyer, bribing the cops, etc. Let’s keep that aside for a while). He had purchased a new house and car just before his job termination, which meant regular EMIs. So I can understand that he was the perfect Bakra for whoever lured him into this QNet. His state of mind would have been terrible with so much debts, EMIs that QNet would seem like the perfect plan to him. Get rich quick.\n\nIt has been 2 years now since his job termination and I estimate he got into QNet in 2019, after his official job termination letter came from his organisation . And he is still draining money, only now in QNet. I don’t understand how he cannot see the fraud in this. Till now I had kept quiet and had just starting ignoring his calls, texts, etc even though he had borrowed a significant amount of money from me as well, but I was furious when I came to know yesterday that he tried his QNet fraud on one cousin sometime in 2019 only. This cousin doesn’t even have a job and earns a decent amount by giving home tuitions. This loser took him to a QNet meeting, gave my cousin the usual deal, and my completely enamoured cousin “invested” his savings of one year, around Rs.25000. Some of you might say that it was my cousin’s mistake, but mind you, he’s just a kid, only 24 years old, who has never gone out of our hometown. He is not a Dilliwala or some clever guy. Plus, the position of respect &amp; trust of his Jija Jee was enough to assure of cousin that his money is safe. I don’t blame him. Poor kid has not told a soul in this world about his loss, not his family, not his own brother, fearing souring of relations between 2 families and of course the fear of getting scolded by his parents for being so gullible.\n\nMy mom, uncle and I, all have given money to this relative during his job termination hassle days. He kept on telling us that things are getting sorted on his organisation’s end, he might get reinstated, he just needs to pay so and so lawyer, so and so union, so and so cop and we never questioned him. But after he attended his first QNet conference with his whole family in Delhi, we had all adopted the path of ignoring him and just being in touch with my sister for being updated. But after this cousin scandal has come in my knowledge, I feel all elders need to step in. \n\nI don’t know what bullshit he fed his family that they went to attend the conference with him. My sister says they have daily fights over this in which he gives statements like “Whatever Google says doesn’t mean is true, if it’s a scam then why is the company running since so many years, the day I will have money I will show everyone it is not a scam”, etc etc. I don’t know why his father lent him money to invest, what lies he fed him, or that his father is just a plain, old man who himself got duped by own son. Right now, his own father is running his household and my sister teaches in a small play school. This guy has no shame left and puts WhatsApp status denigrating 9-5 jobs, shares videos of BMWs, Rolex, etc with “motivational quotes” of Jack Ma, Elon Musk, APJ Kalam, etc. My blood boils on seeing this. My sister frequently shares her plight with me and I feel helpless. I really care for them , my whole family does and it’s heartbreaking to see this downfall of a hardworking, talented man. I don’t know why his own father doesn’t kick him out of their house and leave him to fend from himself. This guy has no worry in the world. He knows no relative from whom he’s taken money is going to ask for it, his household is running, he’s getting his food cooked, clothes washed, etc. He even has a 2 year old daughter. I have told my sister numerous times to just go back to our house for some time so that this loser realises something at least, but I don’t know what stops her. (Her sasural and maayka are both in same locality). Maybe she thinks things will get better. I don’t know.\n\nHow do I bring this man back from this mess? I know I can’t do much, since I am younger to him so I don’t command that influence over him or can’t even give some dhamki to knock some sense, but what can my mother, uncle or his father do? I feel kicking him out of the house is one way and they can do that easily I feel- they have 2 houses in the city, one belongs to father, one is the newly bought one that belongs to him. Just leave the loser to fend from himself. Why are his parents paying for his ration?\n\nHas anyone amongst you ever seen such a case and have seen anyone come out of this? What kind of threats can my family or his family give to him? Is that even the way to go, or should we proceed with love and care? Basically anything to bring him back to senses? Any legal route?'<br />Author: '2throwawaythrowaway'<br />id: 'g79es5'<br />Flair :Butthurt OP</li>
<li>Title: 'Covid-19 is an opportunity for India to become a manufacturing hub but some NGOs and China are halting it.'<br />Body: 'One of the most immediate consequences of the Coronavirus outbreak and the growing resentment against Beijing, has been a prospective shift in Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) from China to India. For decades, China has been hailed as the “world’s factory”, over its low labour costs and export-driven economy. But foreign companies are now [looking](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/we-are-over-dependent-on-china-1000-firms-wish-to-come-to-india-covid-19-proves-why-india-is-the-best-destination/amp/) to exit China and their preferred choice to relocate, is of course, India. \n\n***However, before we get too excited, we must recall the horrendous experiences with NGOs which have overturned India’s chances at getting FDI with various agitations.***\n\n Japanese companies are looking for a new location after the Shinzo Abe government announced a package worth US $2.2 billion to help manufacturers [shift](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/pack-up-and-get-out-of-there-japan-to-pay-2-2-billion-to-get-japanese-companies-to-exit-china/) production out of China. The state of Uttar Pradesh, led by CM Yogi Adityanath is now planning to [woo](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/leave-china-and-come-to-up-yogi-government-plans-special-package-to-woo-companies-fleeing-china/) these companies fleeing China.\n\nAlso exiting China are South Korean majors such as Hyundai Steel and POSCO are looking to exit China and they plan to set up their factories in the state of Andhra Pradesh, in what can be a massive boost for PM Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and FDI inflows into India. \n\nThe fast-changing world order goes very much in India’s favour and can propel India’s ambitions of becoming a US $ 5 trillion by 2024. In fact, foreign companies exiting China and entering India has long term benefits, as India could become the new engine of world growth. \n\n***At the forefront of this anti-development campaign to block foreign investments is the NGOs nexus that directly or indirectly sabotages crucial projects in the garb of farmer rights or environmental vigilantism.***\n\n According to a 2014 Intelligence Bureau (IB) [report](https://timesofindia.com/india/Foreign-funded-NGOs-stalling-development-IB-report/articleshow/36411169.cms), foreign-funded NGOs such as Greenpeace, Cordaid, Amnesty and Action Aid have been\xa0 “serving as tools for foreign policy interests of western governments” by sponsoring agitations against nuclear and coal-fired power plants in India. For eg.\n\n*In Tamil Nadu, protests had led to the closure of Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper Plant in Tuticorin, which not only hurt the copper industry but also thousands of medium and small sector units whose businesses were dependent on Vedanta’s plant.Later, Chinese companies were* [*alleged*](https://tfipost.com/2019/06/vedanta-chinese-sterlite-protests-01/amp/) *to have funded the anti-Sterlite protests in India that actually had a very negative impact on India’s Copper production,* [*forcing*](https://tfipost.com/2019/10/india-imports-copper-for-the-first-time-in-18-years-reason-the-shutdown-of-sterlite-plant/amp/) *the country to import Copper for the first time in 18 years.*\n\n ***The ambitious*** [***Hyperloop***](https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2020/01/18/maharashtra-puts-brakes-on-hyperloop-richard-bransons-worst-fear-comes-true.html) ***and*** [***Bullet train***](https://tfipost.com/2019/12/stalling-bullet-train-would-mean-uddhav-inviting-pm-modis-wrath-and-pm-modi-wont-be-kind/) ***projects in Maharashtra- both of which could have accelerated the state’s growth unprecedentedly have also run into trouble ever since the Uddhav Thackeray government came to power in Maharashtra***. \n\nAnd this is not just about specific cases of protests, especially in the tribal, Naxal-dominated areas. The sheer vigilantism of the NGOs has led to obnoxious legislation like the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.\n\nThis Act has created [bottlenecks](https://economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/five-years-on-has-land-acquisition-act-fulfilled-its-aim/articleshow/65639336.cms) for several projects such as POCSO’s steel project in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, and US investments in the Modi government’s flagship “Smart Cities” [project](https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-us-tells-india-to-resolve-land-acquisition-fdi-issues-to-set-up-smart-cities-2081432).\n\n# Today, a number of companies are looking towards India, but the mighty Dragon won’t let the situation go out of its hands so easily. It might try to collude with the foreign funded NGOs in India, in order to push against its Indian competitors.\n\nThe foreign funding of NGOs keeps [going up,](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/opinion-foreign-donations-with-hidden-agenda-are-serious-danger-to-indias-national-security/346340) despite the Modi government [tightening](https://tfipost.com/2018/04/ngos-fcra-01/) the screws under the FCRA norms. The NGOs will in all probability continue with their hidden agenda, and it is time for the Modi government to effectively address all key stakeholders.\n\nIndia offers the perfect conditions for any MNC, but the ambitions to emerge as a “manufacturing hub” could go down the drain given the hostile NGO ecosystem and networks within India.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28jz5fr3cru41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136492244085f7d8345e1e727c684b18ba395cda'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'g77bnd'<br />Flair :Bakchod News</li>

<li>Title: 'How Sonia Gandhi and her British Counterparts still ruling the Heart of India- its Villages.'<br />Body: 'So before proceeding, take a look at [this](https://imgur.com/a/B6ACepP). \n\n There is a general perception in India that the biggest threat to India’s national security comes from our two hostile neighbours i.e. is Pakistan and China.\n\n But the truth is that the most serious threat to India’s security comes from the vast network of activist NGOs, human rights organizations and India’s pseudo-secular lobby which are all now collectively known as civil society groups. These civil society   groups, supported, funded and controlled by some western intelligence and church agencies, pose a very grave threat to the very survival of India as a sovereign nation. \n\nMany of these organizations which were first established in India as charity organizations, later changed their colour and started showing their fangs by supporting various militant and  secessionist movements in the country. The NGO and human rights activism got a big boost in the early 1970s with the patronage it received from Sonia Gandhi who came to India in 1968.\n\n The origin of many militant people’s movements like Narmada Bachao Andolan and Kastakari  Sanghatana which were started in the mid-1970s and the take over of the Maoist movement by the pro-US NGO lobby can be traced to this NGO-Sonia nexus. With Rajiv Gandhi becoming the Prime Minister of India in 1984, there was a substantial increase in the NGO lobby’s political influence in the country with the successful induction of many of its nominees into key positions of power in the administration under different ministries. \n\n **FOUR CRUCIAL LEGISLATIONS In 1992**, two very important legislations i.e. 73d and 74th amendments to the Constitution were passed by the Parliament, with the avowed objective of strengthening the institutions of Panchayat Raj and urban bodies through decentralization of power, allegedly meant to allow the people at the lowest level to take part in the decision making process. Some NGO activists had played a very key, but behind-the- scene role, in getting these two amendment bills passed in the Parliament. It was under the pressure of these activists  and also with the support of the top leadership of the Congress party, the Constitution (73d and 74th )   Amendment Bills, were finally passed by the Parliament in  December, 1992.  Another important legislation called Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, (PESA),  which granted extension of the idea of local self-governance to tribal regions in the country, was also passed by the Parliament in 1996. The PESA was enacted on the basis of the recommendations of the Bhuria Committee.   For details see [This](https://imgur.com/a/jY0VyJV).\n\n In 2006, another NGO-sponsored Bill, called ‘The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forests Rights) Act, 2006 was passed by the Parliament, which granted the right of ownership of land and control over minor forest produce and natural resources to the inhabitants of the tribal areas. This Act, also called the Forest Rights Act, was originally drafted by some NGO activists led by Pradip Prabhu, an NGO leader working among the tribals of Thane district in Maharashtra. Pradeep Prabhu had also conducted a nation- wide campaign by holding morchas and demonstrations throughout the country in association with other like-minded activist groups in other states to mobilize support for this Bill.\n\n As per this new Act, Panchayats in tribal areas have now become the controlling authority for forest  management at the ground level, replacing the control of the Forest Department.   In a federal republic like India, it is the Union government and various state governments that wield all the powers and perform all the functions of the government. With the passage of the 73d and 74th Amendment to the Constitution Acts, the division of powers and functions of the government have now been trickled down to local self governments i.e. Panchayats and Gram Sabhas in rural areas and Ward Committees and Area (Mohalla) Committees in urban areas.\n\n With the passage  of PESA Act and the Forest Rights  Act, the Schedule-V areas and tribal areas have also been brought under the purview of this three-tier system of governance. But, why should the civil society activists, who have been supporting all anti-national movements in India like the  Maoist movement, Kashmiri separatists, Tamil nationalist organizations and agitations against various mega development projects in India, have suddenly become the champions of a Gandhian concept like Gram Swaraj and empowerment of Gram Sabhas, Mohalla Sabhas &amp; Forest Panchayats? The NGO lobby’s sudden love and interest in empowering the Gram Sabhas and its proclaimed aim to strengthen the Panchayat Raj system has some sinister designs.\n\n Their aim is not simply to strengthen the Panchayat Raj, but to take control of the empowered Panchayat institutions throughout the country. When the provisions of the Panchayat Raj are fully implemented, there would not be much powers left with the state and district administration and those who control the Panchayat institutions in rural areas and Mohalla Sabhas in urban areas  would become the real rulers of the country. \n\n ***WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE GRAM SABHA, NO MINING PROJECT WHETHER IT IS COAL, BAUXITE, IRON ORE OR URANIUM*** can be undertaken by the government, or any development project can come up under the jurisdiction of the Gram Sabha and the Mohalla Sabha. In rural areas, where the major industrial and  development projects are concentrated and new ones are scheduled to come up, the Gram Sabhas are almost fully under the control of the NGO activist groups. It is with such sinister designs that the militant NGOs are concentrating on organizing the masses in the remote rural and tribal areas and pressing for full implementation of the 73d and 74th amendment of the Constitution.\n\n***It is easy for the foreign-funded NGOs, who work in the remote tribal and rural areas to influence the poor and illiterate village  elders by bribing them with liquor and money and control the Gram Sabhas. Militant NGOs have already established their control over thousands of Gram Sabhas in states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra.***\n\nThe Gram Sabhas are now used by the NGO-sponsored anti-development lobby to stall hundreds of mega development projects, including coal, bauxite and other mining projects, in these states in a bid to stall our economic progress at the behest of their funding agencies in the west.  For instance, all the 12 Gram Gabhas controlled by the NGO lobby in Rayagada and Kalahandi districts of Odisha have voted against the Rs.50000 crore aluminium refinery project of Vedanta Resources in the Niyamagiri hills in August, 2013. \n\nThe grand strategy of the NGO lobby to build up militant people’s movements all over the country and cultivating/inducting a large network of agents in various  ministries and government departments, including the judiciary and armed forces, finally resulted in the creation of a gigantic octopus-\n\n ***like NGO war machine with its tentacles tightening its grip over the entire country with every passing day.***\n\n This was made possible because of the help and close cooperation extended to the NGO  lobby by Sonia Gandhi from the seventies onwards. This so-called dream concept of Swaraj is actually a  cunning strategy devised by the western intelligence agencies to grant total autonomy and self-rule to all the states in India by using the sweet terms like empowering the Gram Sabhas and Mohalla Sabhas all across India. \n\nWith various militant and separatist movements dominating many border states and interior parts of India, what could happen to the idea of India if total autonomy and self-rule is granted to such regions? \n\n# Clearly the only aim of crooks like Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, Jairam Ramesh and Mani Shankar Aiyar, who are the staunchest supporters of this ‘Swaraj’ movement, is to facilitate the process of India’s Balkanization as desired by their masters in the west.\n\n[Source](https://twitter.com/WindsOfChange72/status/1253280172855439360)'<br />Author: 'tushar_soni_01'<br />id: 'g729hx'<br />Flair :Research</li>
