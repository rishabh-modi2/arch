You cannnot even name them directly without being threatened or perhaps beaten up by a mob. Is this the new hindustan? \n\nBollywood why are your eyes shut on this????  In the year 2013 i knew a 20 something struggling actor who was a sindhi caste boy of hindu religion. He converted to islam to get more acting jobs in TV and bollywood. He is in the marathi tv industry a known face today so i won't name him. I cannot tweet anything questioning their bigotry without having my account terminated. How will our future generations be safe from them? \n\nTl; DR i have a family friend of that community (M55) he openly admits (in private of course)  their community people are very lazy in general and very intolerant towards any other religions.

We Indians have a really bad habit of cribbing how great Western culture is and how we lack. But, we seldom are aware of the gems collecting dust in the mildewed attic of our forgetfulness.\n\nHere are\xa0 points why you should read Gunahon ka Devta:\n\n1. The protagonist: Western books often present a brooding bad boy who is transformed by the love of his life. Here, our protagonist is a serious young man having lofty ideals. Frankly, his goodness and pure character at the beginning of the book was so refreshing. The corruption of his character from being a pure, innocent Devta to a Pret, Gunahon ka Devta is something that will create a heaviness in your heart. Chander's negative character arc is tragically beautiful.\n\n2. Love story between Chander and Sudha: There's no love at first sight here. Instead there's the love the creeps on your soul and you don't even realize how every fibre of you has become entwined with that love. Though many people complain that the love between them is patriarchal, I beg to differ. Yes, Sudha worships Chander as Devta but not because he's a man, but due to the loftiness of his character. Yes, Chander dictates Sudha where to go, but it is only because Chander is older than her and more mature and acts like a guardian to Sudha. There are also discussions on how caste system is the cause of separation between the lovers, but if you have an understanding of Indian society, Chander considered Sudha's father as his parent and hence, could not break his trust by keeping a conjugal relationship with Sudha. Also, his relationship with Sudha had fraternal undertones and he couldn't bear the thought of mixing sex with their pure relationship.\n\n3. Haunting secondary characters: Be it Anglo Indian Pammi and her brother Bertie, Binati, Buaji, Bisariya, Dr. Shukla, each character has its own nuances and depth and\xa0character arcs which haunt the reader days after he has finished the novel.\n\n4. Exquisite imagery: Did I mention how exquisitely Bharti Ji painted the setting and the imagery is so vivid that you feel you yourself are there with the characters. Especially the scene at Lake with Chander and Pammi.\n\nOverall, this novel is a masterpiece and everyone should read it once in a lifetime.\n\n\nHave you read the book?

Indeed, the Quit India movement gave a mighty setback to the till-then invincible British imperialist forces. This is especially mind-boggling when you consider the fact that there was no Britain, what to talk of British empire, in 1555, the year when Nostradamus made his predictions. Britain was formed in 1603 and the battle of Plassey was fought in 1757 (heralding British rule in India).  \nBefore I continue, let me share a case to show that while we feel thrilled at getting a peek into the future, yet when we modify it to suit our whims and fancies, in other words, when the prophecies become self-serving, how disastrous they can be! For example, Hitler twisted Nostradamus for propaganda purposes. He brought out a false "Centuries" to predict the unending glory of Nazi Germany. Contrarily, however, Nostradamus had predicted the annihilation of Nazis for mass-murder of Jews.

Thank you Sir. \n\nThis book is about , a man, a rashtrawadi (without condition I must say), a poet, a freedom fighter, The Most dangerous man India has ever produced, a man who got 2 transportation of Life, The Father of Hindutva, A reformist, A thinker, A man who stood for common rights. \n\nThis book is about Vinayak, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar or I must say **Swatantryaveer Savarkar**. This is a name which evokes different emotions in different people. \n\nThe skeletons of Indian history are now tumbling out. The gap between reality and public perception in terms of the freedom struggle, is laid bare in this factual and non hagiographic account of the life of Vinayak. This book makes justice to this most dreaded and untouchable freedom fighter and class apart revolutionist of India. The book smashes the lie of mercy petition of Savarkar, which often is used to malign this legend. \n\nI must not reveal anymore, I want you to find out the truth for yourself. \n\nFebruary 26, 1966: Veer Savarkar ji  gave up his life by giving up food and water in the highest traditions of Yoga satisfied that he had carried out all his duties in this life.\n\n‚Äú‡§Ö‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø ‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§®‡§Ç‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•Ä, ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§≤‡§æ,\n\n‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•Å ‡§ú‡§ó‡§§‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ï‡§µ‡§£ ‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ \n\nWithout beginning nor end am I, inviolable am I.\n\nVanquish me?
