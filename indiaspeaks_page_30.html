Weirdly, the Punjabi group got beaten up more (even tho both had blunt weapons). \n\nThe cops came and broke up the fight. The prime khalistan supporter, possibly on a refugee visa is hospitalized.

And all the medias are discussing only about the death of an actor, it is understandable that they discuss about it for, let\'s say 4 days, then they should come back to the major issue here. This pandemic has no religion no caste, it shows no discrimination and it is spreading like wildfire. The Gov is really not  taking it Seriously. But in the beginning they did take it seriously and medias too, but now it seems nobody cares. \n\nI am a medical researcher, and i am also involved with various teams researching about this virus. So please don\'t post things like "look at our recovery rate or look, our death rate is lowest among the world." these days are just useful in giving a false sense of comfort for the layman. \nSuch datas are easily manipulated, and in India many deaths goes unreported. And these 2 datas are not the tool to measure the severity of this pandemic.\nThe gov should take it more seriously,and they should also make sure the medias are focusing on the pandemic, because then only the common man will take it seriously.\nIt\'s not the time for building temples, or celebrating festivals, we are having a fight with an invisible enemy, and the enemy is winning,. The gov and the people must take it seriously.\nAnd one more thing that goes neglected in our country is that getting recovered doesn\'t mean you are safe, this virus will cause permanent lifelong damages to the body. We are a young population, and we do not want this young population to suffer from lifelong disabilities.\nThis is the time for the gov to show it\'s willpower and for the people to follow the restrictions put forth..'<br />Author: 'random0dude8'  id: 'ijbilo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ijbilo/wtf_is_happening_to_our_society/</li>

This is exactly the time of Uthradom (Onam Eve). The Onam festival is celebrated for four days until Purnima. Even South Indian tradition agrees that Onam marks birth of Lord Vishnu as Vamana.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299892654176481281\n\n&gt;Onam is a celebration of birth and victory of Lord Vishnu as Vamana and  return of his devotee king Mahabali to earth. Mahabali comes back every year from sutala  to see his land &amp; celebrate Lord Vamana\'s birth at Vamana temple in Thrikkakara (="place of holy foot") in Kochi\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299894308586184706\n\n&gt;From ancient days,Onam was celebrated in Tamilakam (Tamilnadu-Kerala) not as festival of Bali but as birthday of "Asura destroying" Lord Vishnu.This is mentioned in ancient Sangam literature in a poem called Maturaikkāñci. Nairs still keep Onam battle traditions of this poem\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299896163391344640\n\n&gt;This tradition of celebrating Onam as birthday of Vishnu continued to be celebrated in the middle ages. Medieval literature like the 10th century Divya Prabandham shows Onam continued to be celebrated as festival of Lord Vishnu.Rice and fruits were prepared and offered to Vishnu\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299897022611255296\n\n&gt;That Onam was a festival of Lord Vishnu is confirmed by Independent sources. William Logan, a Scottish civil servant of 19th cent noted in his "Malabar Manual" that Onam was the day on which Vishnu descended to make his people happy.Along with Vishnu came Vishnu\'s devotee Bali\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299898053298499585\n\n&gt;Francis Day was a 17th century  East India Company administrator who lived in Kerala and Tamilnadu. He wrote a book about Kerala based on his ethnographic study. In his book, he reproduced the stories of Onam he heard from local people. Francis Day also writes in his book that Keralites of his day believed Onam marked the day when Lord Vishnu wandered about the earth. Along with Vishnu came his devotee Mahabali\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299899487515680768\n\n&gt;Earliest record of Onam in Kerala comes from Thirikkara Vamana temple (861 CE). Even today, Onam is celebrated here as birthday of  Vamana. It is believed that Bali also returns to worship the Lord every year on this day. Processions of Vamana Murti("idol") are carried out\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299901036853821440\n\n&gt;Unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism does not have any centralizing authority like the pope.Because of this reason,the mode of celebration of Onam festival has diversified over centuries among various caste and communities who celebrated the festival in different ways.\n\n&gt;This does not change the fact that Onam was originally a festival that marked the birthday of Vishnu as Vamana. And traditional onam celebrates this aspect even today.\n\n&gt;Even today, the most important part of Onam celebrations is Thrikkakara Appan, which is a clay Pyramid representing Lord Vamana who is worshiped as the guest. This only shows how communists and evangelists have systematically divorced Onam from its Hindu roots\n\n&gt;The Onam exceptionalism is a myth. On the same Onam day, Vamana Dwadashi or Vamana Jayanti is celebrated across several regions of India.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299906811651268610\n\n&gt;The liars have been pitting Vamana against Bali. But such a dichotomy cannot be supported even by the story in Bhagvata Purana. Vishnu comes to test Bali\'s generosity. He becomes satisfied &amp; grants Bali any boon he wishes. But Bali has only one wish. To always be with Vishnu. Vishnu grants the wish.  He leaves Vaikunta and repairs to Bali\'s new abode Sutala where there is no fear, hatred, disease.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299909422165028864\n\n&gt;Srimad Bhagavatam (5.24) says Lord Vamana served as gatekeeper of Bali in Sutala which is grander than Svarga. Vamana kicked Ravana out of Sutala when Ravana invaded Sutala. Such is the beautiful relation between Bhagavan and Bhaktha. Hateful marxists are not sparing even that.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TIinExile/status/1299909814265327619\n\n&gt;Just a minor detail.

      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] In the face of Chinese Aggression, India should give up the idea of Strategic Autonomy and enter clear international alliances'<br />Body: "Non-alignment, or it's post cold-war avatar Strategic Autonomy, is generally understood as a set of policies in foreign relations where a nation takes decisions with the participation of other countries and third parties or without if need be, as it deems fit. This means being able to set rules and terms of engagement instead of being forced to follow rules set by others and to be bound by wholesale commitment to another country or grouping. \n\nRecent events such as  the domination of global supply chains by China, the circumstances that led to the spread of the Corona virus and in particular, Chinese aggression at the Indo-Tibet border has made it very clear that in addition to being a rival to India's regional and international aspirations, an untrustworthy China also represents a direct threat to India's sovereignty.\n\nThus,in the face of Chinese Aggression, should India give up the idea of Strategic Autonomy and enter clear international alliances with for example, USA, the Quad, EU, etc with a clear aim to counter China? \n\nSome points [for] the motion - Alliances allow much closer cooperation, the threat of China is very real and immediate, thus action should not be half-hearted. Entering an alliance would make India a more trustworthy partner. Allows India to send clear signals and act quickly. Now when the strategic aims are very clear (contain China), so the ends must be placed before the means. \n\nSome points [against] the motion - International relations are temporary, can change but alliances can be hard to exit when that happens. No alliance is complete without a quid-pro-quo, can lead to entrapment and dependence. Cooperation can happen without an official alliance. Status quo allows balancing of various relationships in multi-polar world\n\n*[for] Those who are in support of the motion.*\n\nor\n\n*[Against] Those who are not in support of the motion.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Pick a side - For or Against (Based off the topic/what you want to defend).

      <li>Title::: 'TIL : Ekoji who faced the prospect of losing his jagir to the Mughals sold Bengaluru to Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar in 1689 for three lakhs'<br />Body: 'Kempe Gowda I (1510–1570), Modern Bangalore was founded by a feudatory of the Vijayanagara Empire, who built a mud fort in the year 1537. \n\nKempe Gowda also referred to the new town as his "gandu bhoomi" or "Land of Heroes".\n\nAfter conquering the Sultanate of Bijapur, the Mughals under the command of Khasim Khan, then arrived in Bangalore, which was ruled by Shivaji\'s brother Venkoji/ Ekoji Bhonsale. \n\nEkoji , who faced the prospect of losing his jagir to the Mughals, made an offer to sell Bangalore to Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar in 1689 for three lakhs.\n\n The only catch is that this incident occurred exactly 333 years ago, on July 10, 1687, and the property in question was the city of Bengaluru\n\n The principal characters in this dispute are historical figures we are familiar with: the seller was Ekoji (Venokji), the half-brother of Maratha King Shivaji. The relative was Sambhaji, Shivaji’s son. The buyer was Chikkadevaraja Wadiyar, the ruler of Mysore and the land shark was Kasim Khan, the Mughal general sent by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. \n\n The entire ‘property deal’, so to speak, took place for Rs 3,00,000. But how did this come to be?\n\n Chikkadevaraja ascended the throne of Mysore in 1673 and is credited with expanding the frontiers of the kingdom to its largest extent. Three of his military exploits stand out. \n\n The first was his defeat of Sri Ranga VI, who was propped up by the rulers of Ikkeri, Bijapur and Golkonda under the pretense of re-establishing the erstwhile Vijayanagara empire. \n\nHis victory against Chokkanatha Nayaka of Madurai extended Mysuru’s influence till Tiruchirapalli in the south. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stopping the Marathas at Srirangapatna**\n\nHis other big success was stopping Shivaji at Srirangapatna, when the latter was mopping up old Bijapur possessions during a campaign in South India. In April 1682, Chikkadevaraja won multiple battles against the Marathas, even defeating the combined forces of Basappa Nayaka of Ikkeri, Qutb Shah of Golkonda and Shivaji’s son Sambhaji at Banavara, in present-day Hassan.\n\nSo when the Mysore forces came face-to-face with the Mughal army at the gates of Bengaluru on July 10, 1687, they were no pushovers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Maratha connection**\n\nShahaji (Shivaji’s father), who was a general in the Bijapur army, was given Bengaluru as a jagir by an Adil Shahi ruler. This was passed on to his son Ekoji. \n\nIn 1674, when Ekoji was dispatched by Adil Shah to sort out a succession dispute of the local ruler in Thanjavur, he did one better. Ekoji eventually crowned himself the king of Thanjavur.\n\nHowever, Ekoji now faced a family dispute over the jagir of Bengaluru. Both Shivaji, and later his son Sambhaji — not always on cordial terms with Ekoji — coveted it. Ekoji held on to Bengaluru and Thanjavur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**After their conquest of Bijapur in 1686, the Mughals rapidly pushed towards the south.**\n\nAurangzeb’s expansion of the Mughal empire culminated with the fall of Bijapur (1686) and Golkonda (1687). Led by Kasim Khan, the Mughal army’s run through the South began in Penukonda, in the present-day Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nChikkadevaraja managed to keep Tumakuru out of Mughal hands. Ekoji, now faced with the prospect of losing his jagir to the Mughals, made the offer to sell Bengaluru to Chikkadevaraja, for a very reasonable price of three lakh rupees. Contemporary accounts suggest that the amount was paid by Chikkadevaraja even before his troops were sent to take possession of the city.\n\nOn his part, Sambhaji sensed an opportunity to settle an old family dispute and dispatched his generals, Santaji and Kesava Triyambak Pant as well as Haraji, the governor of Gingee, to take control of the city before Chikkadevaraja reached there.\n\nThe Mughal general Kasim Khan reached Bengaluru before either of the two. When the Marathas reached the city, they found the Mughal flag fluttering over the ramparts and turned back without a fight.\n\nChikkadevaraja, having already made the purchase, was not willing to give up so easily. He went into battle with the momentum of his victory over the Mughal forces a few months earlier, in Tumakuru. The hostilities lasted four days.\n\nApratima Vira Charitam, a contemporary work written by Tirumalaraya, during the life of Chikkadevaraja\n\nThe Apratima Vira Charitam, a contemporary work written by Tirumalaraya, during the life of Chikkadevaraja, records the result of this battle, \'Mogalr savari sade badidu, manidar Mogalar, odida Mogalara padeyam, Mogala Maratarganjuva perarayar rayaraltu, avaram jayisirpa Chikadevarayane Rayan.\' (He overcame the Mughal forces.The Mughals were defeated. The Mughal forces fled. Those afraid of the Mughals and Marathas are not kings. Chikkadevaraja who defeated them both is the real king.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; With this victory, the Bengaluru region firmly became part of Mysore and even today is considered part of the ‘Old Mysore’ region. Mysuru, for the first time fought and defeated the Mughals, making them recognise Mysore Kingdom as a force to reckon with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn July 14, 1687 Kasim Khan concluded an agreement with the king, securing for the Mughal’s a transit through Benglauru to Sira, in Tumakuru, where the Mughals established their regional government. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[***https://www.deccanherald.com/spectrum/spectrum-top-stories/how-bengaluru-was-bought-for-rs-3-lakh-333-years-ago-859720.html***](https://www.deccanherald.com/spectrum/spectrum-top-stories/how-bengaluru-was-bought-for-rs-3-lakh-333-years-ago-859720.html)\n\n[***https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-the-mughals-sold-bengaluru-for-rs-3-lakh-330-years-ago/articleshow/59468117.cms***](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/how-the-mughals-sold-bengaluru-for-rs-3-lakh-330-years-ago/articleshow/59468117.cms)\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikka\\_Devaraja***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikka_Devaraja)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'iixylq'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iixylq/til_ekoji_who_faced_the_prospect_of_losing_his/</li>

Everyone is surely aware of the famous [London grooming gangs](https://www.opindia.com/2020/07/muslim-grooming-gangs-uk-victim-narrate-details-rape/).\n\nA lot of people have argued that Bangladeshi illegal aliens contribute a lot to our country's economy and are a boost. But, is that a boost for Indian workers? If Bangladeshi illegal aliens come inside this country and take away the jobs of Indian workers, drive down the wages of existing Indian workers, benefit from the schemes released by the Central and State Governments for Indian people and most importantly, VOTE IN OUR ELECTIONS?\n\nIt has been going on in Bengal for a very long time. And these are the results:\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/west-bengal-village-murshidabad-fatwa-music-tv-mobile-phone-liquor-penalty/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/west-bengal-village-murshidabad-fatwa-music-tv-mobile-phone-liquor-penalty/)\n\nAnd if you don't get terrified this, you won't get terrified by anything:[According to a Pew Research Center Study](https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/), 82% of Bangladeshi Muslims surveyed support making sharia law the official law in their country, 26% said suicide bombings in the name of Islam are justified.\n\nAre we supposed to let such elements in this country or keep them out? We can radically reduce illegal immigration in our country. And here's how:\n\nFirst, build a barrier. Call it a wall. Call it a fence. Call it what you will. Add cameras and sensors. Add drones. Beef up the patrols. All that matters is that we regain control of the border.\n\nFences work. The triple fence outside San Diego led to a 90 percent reduction in infiltration. Israel’s border fence with the West Bank produced a similar decline. Even holier-than-thou Europeans have conceded the point: Hungary, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Austria, Greece, Spain – why, even Norway -- have all started building border fences to stem the tide of Middle Eastern refugees.\n\nThen enforce two other measures: a national E-Verify system or NPR that makes it just about impossible to work if you are here illegally.\n\nThe wall/fence will, of course, be ugly. So are the concrete barriers to keep truck bombs from driving into the Parliament. Sometimes function has to supersede form.\xa0\n\nAnd don't tell me that this is our Berlin Wall. When you build a wall to keep people *in*, that's a prison. When you build a wall to keep people *out*, that's an expression of sovereignty.\n\nOf course, no barrier will be foolproof. But it doesn't have to be. It simply has to reduce the river to a manageable trickle.\n\nSo, let’s pressurize our MPs tofix that. Bring NPR, build the damn barrier. It’s ridiculous to say that it can’t be done.\n\nAnd who would certify that the border is back in our control? I would have a neutral party, perhaps a commission of retired Supreme Court Judges, issue the judgment.\n\nWe can’t give any Bangladeshi illegal alien citizenship. That’s a bridge too far. You don’t get to join the political destiny of the country by entering it illegally.\n\nRadical border control, followed by radical legalization. No mushy compromise. A solution requires two acts of national will: putting up a wall (along with NPR) and absorbing those who broke our laws to come to India.\n\nThis is not a compromise meant to appease both sides without achieving anything.\n\nIf we do it right, not only will we solve the problem of illegal immigration, we will get it done as one nation."<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'iityak'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iityak/building_a_wall_at_the_bangladesh_border_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The role of the Global Left in undermining India.'<br />Body: 'A post I shared about riots happening in Sweden was removed because apparently, I didn\'t make it clear how it affected India. Let me do so now. First, look at this:\n\n[https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1298153192526696449](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1298153192526696449)\n\nThis is "climate change activist" Greta Thunberg tweeting about JEE/NEET exam situation in India. Incidentally, Greta Thunberg is from Sweden. So, Greta Thunberg interferes in a country\'s sovereign matters and tweets about something she knows nothing about. Now, look at this:\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/sweden-riots-allahu-akbar-quran-burning-viral-video/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/sweden-riots-allahu-akbar-quran-burning-viral-video/)\n\nThese are riots that are being done by "religion of peace" members. Moreover, it\'s happening in her OWN COUNTRY, Sweden. Greta Thunberg has enough time to tweet about something happening in a distant country. And yet, she stays mum on things happening in her own backyard.\n\nWhy does it matter?  \n\nImagine if you were having an argument with your partner about the family finances. Both of you make excellent points weighing the risks and the rewards. Obviously, there is no clear winner.\n\nThen suddenly, there is a knock on the door. A complete stranger shows up and says that they are very passionate about supporting one of you. You would be puzzled. You would wonder: Why does this stranger care so much?\n\nGreta Thunberg is not an individual who tweets on whims. She is a billion dollar brand. Her face and name are capable of raising millions of dollars for any venture. A lot of thought from a large, well paid and highly professional team goes into every venture which is backed by the brand.\n\nThink about it: if big oil or big banks were tweeting about postponing exams in India, would you accuse them of being ignorant or patronizing? Not at all. You would be curious how the matter impacts their bottomline.\n\nSo the question is: why is a big brand like Greta Thunberg picking up the matter of NEET &amp; JEE exam dates in India? How does it impact their bottomline? That suggests there is big money in the picture here. How did that happen?\n\nWhy is big money getting involved in a matter such as this? Probably because big interests want to destabilize India in every possible way. It’s simple really. The exams are highly competitive. A very small fraction will make it through. What if those who fail are made to blame Modi instead of themselves?\n\nThis is subversion 101 and it works. The anti-CAA protests spread like a rash across many college campuses. Someone wants to provoke the youth on a large scale and that someone has a lot of money. The same goes for abrogation of Article 370. Never have we seen top global newspapers on such a direct vilification campaign against India. Then, a “riot” at the exact moment when the US President landed in India. It is promptly labelled a pogrom by intellectuals all over the world. In perfect coordination, they all scream : Nazi! Nazi! Nazi!\n\nSomething similar with Greta Thunberg. It is essentially a corporate brand. It has no emotions, no prejudices, no friends and no enemies.\n\nSomeone has turned these corporate machines: from the New York Times to Greta Thunberg to churn out stuff that undermines the Govt of India. That someone has a lot of money. We don’t know who it is, but they don’t wish us well.

Also manhandled my father to make sure we weren\'t recording the interaction.\n\n\n8) I can write a book on everything else they did and said, but this is all from a hospital where the ward boys sell the saline bottles in black market, kidneys are taken from dead bodies and sold, wrong patients are sent to the mortuary even if they haven\'t passed away yet, I have seen all of this happen first hand. Lady doctors are not respected by their own professors. The patients here deserve better from their own government. Why is there a KCR island being built for tourism when the govt hospitals are in such a state? The interns are overworked and tortured, which interferes with patient care. There is a lot of misogyny, caste politics, discrimination. The people here won\'t give you a glass of water without asking for a bribe first.\n\n\nI feel that students like me should not take a transfer to do their internship at xyz Hospital. I believe there is not much to learn here except for the corruption and sad state of patients. There isn\'t much to see here to become a good doctor. The toxicity of this place will pull you down.'<br />Author: 'RoundDistance'  id: 'iimmza'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iimmza/corruption_in_government_hospital/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Are allegations on Sudarshan news about hatred against Muslims valid?'<br />Body: "Although the program is yet to be aired and its exact nature is not known, many people pointed out that what the program is pointing out is already done regularly by liberals and leftists media houses who are attacking the channel now. Sudarshan News is alleged of hatred against Muslims for talking about increased number of Muslim candidates in UPSC exams, but such analysis is regularly peddled by leftists, when they do caste-based analyses.\n\n[https://twitter.com/BefittingFacts/status/1298922225467195392](https://twitter.com/BefittingFacts/status/1298922225467195392)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BefittingFacts/status/1298925915779391489](https://twitter.com/BefittingFacts/status/1298925915779391489)\n\n Left-liberals media houses have published innumerable stories on alleged Brahmin and upper dominance in judiciary, bureaucracy etc. Such media houses even segregate soldiers based on caste, but now have problem if someone studies number of Muslims in civil and police services.\n\nA study done by Yugaparivartan portal three years ago confirms the conclusion of Sudarshan News. The [study](http://yugaparivartan.com/2017/06/03/does-upsc-favours-muslims-in-ias-interview/) based on UPSC exam result in 2017 had shown that Muslims on average get 13 marks more at the interview stage as compared to other communities. The analysis had shown that when Muslim and non-Muslim candidates obtained equal marks in the written exam, the Muslim candidates got more marks at the interview stage. The portal had claimed that the study revealed bias at interview stage in favour of Muslims as compared to other communities.\n\nSimilarly, 18 students trained by Zakat Foundation had [cleared](https://www.opindia.com/2019/04/zakat-foundation-upsc-results-muslim-ias-students-shah-faesal/) the UPSC exams last year, causing worry about growing influence of Islamists on the Indian babudom. Zakat Foundation is an NGO founded on ‘Islamic principles’ carrying out various activities, which includes ‘coaching’ for civil services, specially aimed at helping Muslim students. Former IAS officer who took the plunge and floated his own political party, Shah Faesal, is one of the most popular alumni of Zakat Foundation. Faesal, who had topped the civil service examination in 2010 had\xa0[called India ‘Rapistan’](https://www.opindia.com/2019/03/former-ias-shah-faesal-who-had-called-india-rapistan-launches-political-party-joined-by-jnu-freelance-protestor-shehla-rashid/).\n\nIt's quite rich for leftists and Islamists to clutch their pearls and play victim card now when this is the exact thing they've been doing all these years. But then again, playing the victim card is the only thing they know how to do well."<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'iimhmp'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iimhmp/are_allegations_on_sudarshan_news_about_hatred/</li>

The BJP is try to increase its presence in the south  by stealing the DMK Partymen. Both Congress and BJP would take seats from DMK and AIADMK. There would be a lot of horse trading after the election result. I don't any party will have an absolute majority. \n\n3) **Kerala** \\- The Left Government in Kerala will get decimated due to the Swapna Suresh Scandal. The Congress Party should win (if they don't win Kerala  they are in a real crises). I could see BJP trying to make inroads in Kerala but not forming the government in Kerala\n\n4) **West Bengal** \\- The BJP will try to push the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal . The Left Parties and the Trinamool Congress will lose badly in West Bengal. The Congress will win more seats than Mamta Banerjee in Bengal. The BJP will be the largest party in the Bengal Assembly however it may not form the government due to differences with Mamta and the Left Parties.

      <li>Title::: 'Why I feel the BJP Government should atleast listen to the safety concerns of the students and rethink about postponing the exams'<br />Body: 'I know what the general consensus on this sub is; but as someone who gave and cracked the NEET exams two years back, there are some points I wish to discuss. \n\n1. A lot of people feel that the LW is using this issue to manipulate the students and for their own agenda, and frankly, I agree, they are doing that. But the students were demanding postponement way before the LW jumped in. Back then, prominent twitter handles of RW made fun of students calling for postponement, told them that ‘real’ students are studying and that they’re just lazy they don’t want to give the exam. All this just paved way for the LW to hijack the issue. This issue wasn’t manufactured by them. It was a genuine issue they hijacked. \n\n2. The safety concerns of students are legitimate. SoPs have massively failed in the exams conducted before. It’s not possible to wear masks for straight up three hours and write exams wearing surgical gloves. \n\n3. There is flood situation in many states like Assam, Bihar, Odisha etc. Students, most of them who’re poor and they don’t live in cities where test centres are located, have to travel long distances to reach their centres. Add to that the flood situation and the fact that transportation services are fairly affected due to covid. Many of those exam centres are water logged. \n\nWhat could be the solution? Postpone the exams till November. I know, corona ain’t going away and that aspect is still gonna be there in November too, but there are things the government could arrange by then that could be of great help. \n\n1. JEE exams are held in phases over a span of few days. The same could be done for NEET exams. Instead of having it in a single day from 2pm to 5pm, they could have it over a span of few days and in slots. The first slot could be from 10 in the morning till 1 and the next one could start from 2. They would have to make multiple question papers for this to happen, but that’s not a big deal. This is exactly how AIIMS exams happened till last year.\n\nThis would ensure that the number of students in the test centre at a particular time is limited to a small number. That would mean they could ensure more than 6 feet distancing between students while they give exams. Is this foolproof? No. But this is certainly better than having all the students and their parents at the centres on the same day and the same time. \n\n2. Ensure that restrictions on transportation facilities are gradually lifted by then in all the states and it isn’t a hassle for the students to travel. Also, this could mean that international students could be flown in and could be quarantined for 14 days before they appear for the exams. Flood situation should be under control by then. \n\n3. If the NEET exams were held in May as scheduled, the MBBS classes would’ve started in late Aug-September. If they’re held in November, the classes could start from January. This is a four month delay and can be easily compensated by cutting holidays and extra classes. The next batch would start from Aug 2021. That is a gap of 7-8 months between two batches. \n\n4. Also, increase the number of places where centres are available. A state like Bihar, where majority of aspirants fall under the middle class-poor category, the centres are available in only two cities; Patna and Gaya.'<br />Author: 'SailorsMoon10'  id: 'ii3vjb'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ii3vjb/why_i_feel_the_bjp_government_should_atleast/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Army and Religion'<br />Body: 'When I was a first termer in NDA (not the political one; this is the far more prestigious National Defence Academy), I overheard two Drill Ustaad speaking to each other about the new Colonel Training of the academy. "Madrassi hai, pata nahi kya kya changes ho jayega training mei", one of them mumbled in a forlorn tone. Being a South Indian myself, I wondered why this particular emphasis on the Officers’ regional base was to be discussed. I soon forgot about it, caught up with the hectic routine of the academy. One day, while being seated in the academy, I saw a smartly turned out Sikh Colonel striding on to the stage to address the cadets. I shot a quick question to my neighbour, "Who\'s he?" I got a response in return, "Colonel Training". "No way, the Colonel Training is a Madrassi, not a Sikh officer," I said in all my confident and smug tone. "Yes, you fool. He is a Madrassi - he belongs to the Madras Regiment". My smugness made a quick exit and I learned a lesson that day. An officer\'s religion is that of his men. Period.\n\nThat day, and the 18 years that have followed, I saw not one reason to believe otherwise. Religious beliefs in the Army have fierce rooting. Men kill and die on the war cries of Gods and Goddesses. It is what keeps them bonded, glued and motivated. It is what makes them believe that they are being looked after. In this overall scheme of things, a leader\'s role is nothing less than the link between the deity and the man on the ground. A \'Bihari\' may well be a Coorgi from Karnataka and a \'JAT\' may be a Mallu from Kerala. It is the Regiment that matters, not the origins. Terms like \'Pahadi\', \'Pandit\', \'Tambi\' are terms that are used with pride and dignity, not otherwise.\n\nAs a young Gun Position Officer, when for the first time, we were poised for live firing in the Rajasthan Ranges, I stood with all others for the Aarti that is performed before the Guns would start firing. In all the ensuing chants of \'Om Jai Jagadish Hare,\' I remained mum, not once uttering a single line of the hymn. After the Aarti ended and the Pandit offered the Prasaad, I again refused to partake of it. Later, when the men dispersed to get ready for the firing, our Second in Command (2ic) got hold of me and questioned me as to why I did not participate in the Aarti wholeheartedly. I told him that I was a non-believer and did not intend taking part in the religious act. He looked at me long and hard, and with all his restraint, he told me that it doesn\'t matter one bit whether I believed or not, it is a parade and I will bloody well sing the bhajan and consume the Prasaad. I mumbled a defiant acceptance but only later realised that it does matter whether one participates or not. The man who believes, cannot be discouraged by a leader who doesn\'t. It is a Parade and it is supposed to be done with all sincerity. The 2ic, by the way, was a Christian.\n\nAs a Captain with 3 years of service, I was posted in Drass and for a long time, I was the convoy commander between Drass and Sonamarg. Those who have negotiated the Zozi La would recollect the prominent Captain\'s Mor where Captain HC Vadera of the MADRAS Sappers gave up his life during a road widening work in 1954. The Captain\'s Memorial is a permanent pit stop for every vehicle that crosses the Pass. It is considered an ill omen if one passes the point without paying obeisance. It didn\'t matter if I believed or not. As the Convoy Commander, I had to believe; there was no option or choice. There are similar cases of Harbhajan Baba, Jaswant Memorial and many more in every nook and corner of the country. These are the things that matter to the simple military man/woman. One cannot ignore these in the larger interest.\n\nFor a large part of my unit life, my buddy was a guy called Mohammad Jabir, fondly called as Javed at home. He was fiercely religious and followed all religious procedures diligently. He was a young recruit and had certain inhibitions in being a \'buddy\'. I did not ask him to do anything that he wasn\'t comfortable doing. In a short time, we developed a unique bond which was based on mutual respect. He used to do tasks for me out of his interest without any external prodding. Not only that, but he was also a good professional soldier who knew his tasks on the Gun well and took a keen interest in Unit activities in addition to being a fantastic Boxer and sportsman. Every day with Javed was learning. He was a storehouse of knowledge. My Father coined the term ‘Hanuman’ for him. He was like that. No task was impossible and nothing was less than 100%. He was part of the family. Need I mention that not once did it occur to us that as per the social norms, we were at two extreme ends of the spectrum? A South Indian Brahmin family and a North Indian Muslim. There simply is no place for religious biases or prejudices in the Indian Army.\n\nThere was an occasion when we were posted in Delhi and were allotted a spanking new flat as accommodation. I was tired of staying in the guestroom and was keen on shifting into the house immediately. My wife was then out of the station and not likely to get back any time sooner. Initially, Javed tried to delay the shifting by giving reasons that the house was being handed over slowly. Thereafter he started giving flimsy reasons amounting to much more delay. When I finally confronted him on what was happening, he gave me a sheepish answer that we were waiting for the auspicious day to shift into the new house! My wife and Javed were in constant discussion on this so-called auspicious time. Eventually, it did happen and he completed the ritual by boiling milk in a new pot until it boiled over the sides to symbolize an abundance of prosperity and food to bless the new home as per the Hindu rituals. Only then was I allowed to set foot into the house!\n\nJaved was with me through thick and thin. He was there when I picked up my little one in my arms; he was there when we had a marriage in the family and he was also there alongside me, bearing the the mortal remains of my Father and when I lit the funeral pyre while I was emotionally drained and was down and out. Religion cannot superimpose itself on humanity or the soldierly bonhomie. Never.\n\nMost common sights that one would encounter in a Fauzi religious ceremonies would be that of a Sikh/Muslim/Christian Commanding officer or Subedar Major performing the regimental Hawan and Aarti on religious occasion; people of all faith come together in devotion under a common roof called Sarv Dharm Sthal; singing their hearts out in Aarti or Ardaas. These are not some special sights. These are some of the most common ones which do not even need a second glance or be mentioned especially since the fabric of the Indian Army is so interwoven with acceptance of all religions and beliefs. There is simply no room for bias or favouritism.\n\nIt is very important to follow religious practices and beliefs in the army. Simply because a Soldier needs to repose his faith in a Superior Being. It is that belief in the Almighty that assures him that no harm will come his or his Paltan\'s way. It is that hope which consoles him that even if something were to happen to him, his family will be taken care of. And it is the same belief that gives him confidence of victory in the battle field, however impossible the odds are. It is essential that the hope and belief remain unadulterated and regular gatherings in the Sarv Dharm Sthal be organised to keep the flame of their faith burning. A notable dialogue of the Protagonist from the Hindi Movie \'PK\' goes thus - "Till the time I believed in the existence of God, I had hope of finding my Remote. The day I concluded that there is no God, I lost my hope". Succinct and precise.\n\nAn officer has a massive responsibility. As was evident in my earlier examples, dealing with a multitude of faiths and beliefs, it is a sensitive and delicate balance that has to be ensured. Years of peaceful coexistence preclude any undesirable situation from erupting but as an officer, this balance must be maintained at all costs. The boat should not be rocked, least of all by an officer himself. I have realized that what works best for every individual is to keep their strong beliefs to themselves and not give them air. Each individual has the freedom to practice their religion but being part of an organization like the Armed forces, individual choices mustn\'t clutter the environment. At no cost should personal preferences come in the way of discharging official responsibilities. If the men under us are different colours and flavours, we are the Blender. And on that note, Heave Ho!\n\n\n[source](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/shifting-gears/226426-indian-army-religion-buddies.html)'<br />Author: 'Eric_Cartman-_-'  id: 'ii1mi0'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ii1mi0/indian_army_and_religion/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Whats the reason behind the slow speeds/high time travel on indian highways?'<br />Body: "Hey everyone, I'm an Indian American. I've visited India a year back. I'd say most of the major highways there are in decent condition with 4-6 lane roads in most areas. I was pleasantly surprised. However, I'm confused by the low speed limits, intense time of travel on the highways. The cities are clustered, but the rural areas which most highways go through obviously dont have any traffic issues. Yet it takes twice as longer as it does on the american highways to travel a similar distance. Most people travel only at 80 kmph. Thats the higher end of the speed limit tbh. Most of the time, the traffic flow is around 60 kmph. I looked at google maps as well to see the distance/time travel between major cities, and the average is around 55-60 kmph. I looked up pakistani, chinese distances as well and they have an average of 75 and 100 kmph respectively. close to the american average. I mean whats going on exactly? Why are the speeds so low there even on the highways going through rural areas. I dont think density is the problem since as i mentioned its not that crowded outside the major cities. Also chinese, pakistani density is not too different since most chinese live in the eastern 1/3 of the country and pakistanis live by the indus river. \n\nAny feedback would be appreciated. thanks :)"<br />Author: 'Dungeonmaster0396'  id: 'ihscyt'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ihscyt/whats_the_reason_behind_the_slow_speedshigh_time/</li>

But instead of using money to make money, you are using money to make people to study religion more, to have a better life.  \n \n\n**Here is an example how it should be done:**  \n **Step 1:** setup, form 2 or more version of your religion with different target people.  \n such as:Original vs Foreign, Old vs New, Short vs Long, Complicated vs Simplify, No explain vs Explanation, etc.  \n \n\n**Step 2:** using various strategies to attach people to study to learn to understand your religion.  \n like: spend money to make competitions, challenge contest, to crazy thing like religion degree, etc.  \n \n\nHere is to learn of why do this do that practice, not to worship pray or follow.  \n \n\nThe rich Arab Royal Families in the Middle East should spend money to explain others about the true pure Islam, they should not spend money for the useless football club.  \n The same go to the Jews, other royals, rich families.  \n \n\nAbove is a quick framework of how to make all religions better than ever for the people to easier learn, to study.  \n I am not get paid to do the detail job, so do not expect me to spend time and energy to help your religion for free, you guys must do by your own.  \n \n\nIf any beings, groups, entities want to have any discussion about the religions and other life matter, the only place I will answer is at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com**, but with very limited time to **September 15th** **2020**.

      <li>Title::: 'They called her ‘kafir’: Hindu woman Santola Devi was lynched to death by 7 Muslims in UP, her family alleges police apathy and threats'<br />Body: "Crime Editor's picks Featured News Reports\n\nThey called her ‘kafir’: Hindu woman Santola Devi was lynched to death by 7 Muslims in UP, her family alleges police apathy and threats\n25 August, 2020\n\nHindu woman Santola Devi was lynched by 7 Muslims in May, a day after Eid\n\nHindu aged woman lynched by Muslim neighbours in Uttar Pradesh's Pratapgarh,\n1366\n\nSantola Devi, a 62-year-old sweet shop owner, from Uttar Pradesh’s Jaganipur village of Fatanpur police stations area in Pratapgarh, was mercilessly beaten up by her Muslim neighbour family with sticks and stones on May 26. She was admitted to a Prayagraj hospital in grievous conditions. After fighting for a day, Santola Devi succumbed to her injuries. \n\nNotably, the Hindu woman was brutally hacked to death, merely a day after Eid. Owing to her age, the helpless woman could do little to save herself. OpIndia learnt that she was assaulted merely because she intervened in a fight that transpired between two people and sided with the one who was right. This irked the Muslim man who along with his family had attacked Santola Devi.\n\nHowever, some media houses had reported that Santola Devi was attacked for raising objections on one Khalil’s goat entering her shop and ruining the sweets which she painstakingly prepared to run the shop she ran with her disabled son. When she complained, Khalil, first got into an argument with her and soon he was joined by his family members who started assaulting the old lady. \n\nSeven members of the Muslim family, including the women of the house Nazbeen Bano and Anari Begum, participated in brutally lynching the old lady.\n\n\nMuslims in Jaganipur, Pratapgarh called Santola Devi ‘Kaafir’ and an ‘enemy of Islam’\n- Advertisement -\n\nJaganipur in Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh is a Muslim dominated village. According to reports, for the last 4-5 years, she was regularly being targetted by her Muslim neighbours, who called her a ‘Kaafir’ (a derogatory reference to non-Muslims) and an ‘enemy of Islam’. But what prevented her from leaving the village was her love for her ancestral house and her shop.\n\nAfter her death, there was a lot of commotion in the village. Initially, the laxity shown by the police and administration in handling the case miffed Santola Devi’s family, who along with other members of the community, protested by placing her dead body on the road and demanding the arrest of all the culprits and compensation for the victim family. Later the SP and the local MLA intervened and took cognisance.\n\nThe son of the Hindu woman took to social media to allege police inaction\nThis three-month-old case recently regained traction after a video of Santola Devi’s son surfaced on social media in which he was seen pleading for justice and making serious allegations against the police.\n\nOpIndia got in touch with one of the three sons of the deceased. Pradeep Kumar, who lives in Goa, gave us the details of what exactly transpired on the day Santola Devi was assaulted.\n\nPradeep told us that what happened with his mother had been brewing for a very long time. The Muslims in the area had been allegedly harassing, abusing and threatening her for a long time. Santola Devi had often complained about this to the local police, but they did not take her seriously. Whenever Santola Devi spoke about this with Pradeep, he advised her to come and live with either of his two brothers, Sushil Kumar and Satish Kumar who lived nearby, but she did not want to leave her house as it was their ancestral property and she had many memories attached to it, recalled the aggrieved son.\n\nPradeep told us that one of his brothers is disabled. But that day, when he heard of the assault, he immediately rushed to help his mother. But he could not do anything because of his physical condition. After this, his wife tried to save the mother, all in vain.\n\nIn a while, his second brother also reached his mother’s home along with his wife. They rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint against Khalil and his family members. But they were made to wait in the police station for two hours, recolleted Pradeep, furthering that after waiting for almost two hours, the police registered the complaint.\n\n\nComplaint registered by Pradeep where he accuses police of inaction\nThe brothers rushed Santola Devi to the local hospital. She was referred to a hospital in Allahabad and then Lucknow, but due to financial constrains, she was brought back to her house. After they somehow arranged for the money, Santola Devi was re-admitted to a nearby hospital where she succumed to her injuries.\n\nSantola Devi’s autopsy report also stated that she sustained injuries at three places and died due to excessive blood loss.\n\n\nSantola Devi’s post mortem report\nFurious at the police authorities, Pradeep said that his 65-year-old mother was mercilessly lynched by 7 people, including Khalil, Aashiq Ali, Arshad, Minaj, Jahanabano and others, but the police did not initiate any action against them until the local MLA, Dheeraj Ojha and the SP took cognizance of the matter.\n\nFamily of the Hindu women threatened, pressurised to withdraw case from various quarters\n“Even after the woman’s death, the Muslim neighbours had no remorse”, Pradeep told OpIndia. When his brother returned to his mother’s house, the mother of one of the accused – Arshad, came there and threatened him. “Let my children be released from police custody, we will show you’ll”, Arshad’s mother threatened Pradeep’s brother. She added that they have already “sent the money” for the same.\n\nIf Pradeep is to be believed, some locals have also been pressurising his family to accept the money the accused family is offering and withdraw the case against them. But Pradeep said sternly, “We want justice, not the money. Today this has happened with us, tomorrow someone else will be targeted”.\n\nNotably, Santola Devi’s son Pradeep has alleged that when his brother spoke to the police regarding the arrest of Jehanabano, the inspector threatened him and said: “You shut up or else you will be trapped and put in jail”. As per Pradeep, the police officer had told him, “Sooner or later, the lady would have anyways died”.\n\nThe grief-stricken son said that the reason why he did not return to the village was its hostile environment for the Hindus. “There are hardly 10 Hindu families living amidst 100 Muslim families in Jaganipur village”, said Pradeep adding that the police apathy had added up to the trauma of losing their mother and has been causing immense grief to the family.\n\n6 accused have been arrested\n\nMeanwhile, the Pratapgarh police have taken to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pratapgarhpol/status/1297449962150584320?s=20) to inform that 6 accused have been arrested.\n\nSantola Devi’s son has also confirmed this to OpIndia, furthering that the accused woman is still absconding. She has been using the burqa to conceal her identity. The victim’s family has, however, demanded that she too is arrested soon. Pradeep is heard mentioning the names of the accused. He names- Khalil, Ashik Ali, Arshad, Hasmin, Minhaj, Bitan, Anno, who he confirms have been arrested, while the police have failed to capture Jehanabano.\n\nPratapgarh police accused of shielding the Muslim family\nOne Twitter user has uploaded the video, wherein Santola Devi’s son can be seen pleading for justice.\n\nHe accuses the police of favouring the accused family and shielding the culprits. The police were forced to register a case after the local MLA intervened and pressurised them to do so. “However, we are still being pressurised to withdraw the case”, alleged the son.\n\nAccording to Pradeep, attempts are being made to implicate his brothers in false cases. He has claimed that some persons have threatened him that unless the family takes back their case, they will be harassed by implicating them under false allegations.\n\n[Ashwini shrivatsa's first tweet](https://twitter.com/TheAshwiniRaj/status/1297395158166560768?s=20)\n\n[Ashwini Shrivatsa's second tweet](https://twitter.com/TheAshwiniRaj/status/1297395793196810240?s=20)\n\n#[Source](https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/pratapgarh-santola-devi-jaganipur-hindu-woman-lynched-death-muslims-crime-harassment-threats-village-police-apathy/)"<br />Author: 'proudbhaarateeya'  id: 'ih2pef'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ih2pef/they_called_her_kafir_hindu_woman_santola_devi/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'When its a slow day but you need to write something negative against India. Geneva Abdul in New York Times -writes "In Hyderabad, Amazon builds its largest office yet. But not everyone is happy". I came across this article on Economic Times.'<br />Body: 'I thought what happened to the Hyderabad office, are they closing it down? But no, it is such a non-story.\n\nHere\'s the article:\n\n&gt; The austere building is hardly distinguishable in the landscape of glass and concrete buildings making up Asia’s Silicon Valley, as Hyderabad, India, is known. It is one of Amazon’s latest developments, the online retailer’s largest oice building in the world. With plans to cement its place as the center of gravity around which online retail revolves, Amazon has turned to India, the world’s fastest-growing market for internet users. And it has picked Hyderabad, a city of nearly 10 million in India’s south, as its base of operations there.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; ***But the project faces challenges, including pushback from local businesses and politicians.***   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hyderabad has emerged in a few short years as a technology and nancial center and a beacon for young talent. The city, which saw the biggest surge in tech oice space last year, is already a base in India for other multinational tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple, which spent $25 million for the development of its oices there. “Hyderabad is a known software tech talent center, and the government has been an enabler for us to have a campus this size,” said Minari Shah, an Amazon spokeswoman. “This is an important conrmation of how India continues to be important to Amazon.” Over the past decade, the technology behemoth has woven itself into the fabric of Indian life. And now, four years after construction began, the Hyderabad office, Amazon’s first fully owned office outside the United States, joins 40 other offices, 67 shipping centers, 1,400 delivery stations and a workforce of more than 60,000 (plus 155,000 contractors) in the country. The record size of the building — 1.8 million square feet — and the total campus area are equal to nearly 65 football fields. They have come to symbolize a defyning feature of India’s booming tech industry: the inexorable presence of international tech companies.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; When Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, visited India in January, he was met with an antitrust case by Indian regulators, who are investigating Amazon and Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, which is owned largely by almart. India bans foreign direct investment in retail, a shift from policy in the United   \n&gt;  \n&gt; States and Britain. By law, Amazon and other foreign-owned e-commerce rms are required to be neutral marketplaces reliant on independent sellers. But Praveen Khandelwal, founder and general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders, which oversees 70 million traders and 40,000 trade associations, argues that the rm has hurt domestic trade, resulting in the closure of thousands of homegrown businesses across the country. **Amazon’s new Hyderabad oice, he said, is merely a way to “push for control and dominance over Indian retail trade in a more structured way.”** Khandelwal led protests against Amazon’s trade practices this year. India’s retail regulator is investigating Amazon over allegations that it is using deep discounts and preferred sellers, said Satish Meena, a senior analyst for global technology research rm Forrester. “There are loopholes they’re exploiting; everyone knows that,” Meena said. The challenges emerging in India echo stories in the United States, where American tech giants have squeezed smaller rivals and business owners. Amazon is facing antitrust charges in the European Union, and Bezos and other tech titans were grilled by U.S. lawmakers in July about their anticompetitive practices. Amazon’s 15-story Hyderabad oice opened last year. It features prayer rooms, a small synthetic cricket pitch, 49 elevators, a helipad and a cafeteria open 24 hours a day on a campus that, according to the company, is made of 2.5 times more steel than the Eiel Tower. It’s home to 7,000 employees out of an expected workforce of 15,000, largely comprising technology teams focused on using machine learning and software development to innovate services — such as Amazon Pay’s cash load service for digital transactions in a country with 190 million citizens who do not use banks — as well as customer service workers. \n\nAnother day for a "South East Asia Expert"\n\n [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/in-hyderabad-amazon-builds-its-largest-office-yet-but-not-everyone-is-happy/articleshow/77755288.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/in-hyderabad-amazon-builds-its-largest-office-yet-but-not-everyone-is-happy/articleshow/77755288.cms)'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'igteh7'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/igteh7/when_its_a_slow_day_but_you_need_to_write/</li>

I don\'t think we should ever stop fighting against the disease and right now is too early to accept the defeat.\n\nRegarding point 2, we have to leave the cage of "admissions first, studies later" behind us. Even if we conduct these exams, most colleges will conduct this semester or part of it online. In that case, we can simply let kids start their first semester studies right now. Lectures can be broadcasted on TV along with internet for better reach. Let students study right away and the govt can provide temporary relief to colleges. Students will pay the fees when the entrance exams and admissions take place.\n\nPoint 1 is a possibility and we need to start thinking about lot of things right now. I think we can have a longer entrance exam period with more centers which would ensure the crowd at any point is manageable and exams at a location can be rescheduled if required. Similar to how we conduct elections. This may be too tough to carry out in short time, but it is quite achievable in a relaxed timeframe.\n\nI don\'t see any point in killing more people on purpose.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is--3.37'<br />Body: '\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nश्री भगवानुवाच\n\n**काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भवः |**\n\n**महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम् || ३७ ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nWhen a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for Kṛṣṇa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\n\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\n\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Vedānta-sūtras, wherein it is said, athāto brahma-jijñāsā: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as janmādyasya yato \'nvayād itarataś ca, or, "The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman." Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Kṛṣṇa consciousness-or, in other words, desiring everything for Kṛṣṇa-then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanumān, the great servitor of Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies.\n\n**Question 1 : Why lust is called the biggest enemy of a living entity ? How the living entity came in contact with it ?**\n\n**Question 2 : How lust and wrath can be spiritualized ? Explain with an example.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yx3989e8u9j51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d235adfc5c97c013f3a358982f01de5891fb8e00'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'igrz88'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/igrz88/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is337/</li>

But videos? Anyone can watch them on YT. And people even pay these ‘creators’ to react to the videos. \n\nI just hit up a couple of reaction videos and 90% of the time these guys missed jokes and only said stuff like ‘ohhhh’, ‘hmmmm’, ‘ewwww’ and laughed unecessarily. And their opinion after the video is boring as hell too. Its like one is trying to get validation of their own opinion after watching something. \n\nMost guys in the comments are subscribing just because the channel owner looks cute or beautiful or their accent is cool( what??) . And the frequency of such comments makes me think that these guys are asking reaction videos just for this. Sometimes the reactions look forced too.

It's just made out of cheap plastic but I think they have intentionally set the price for this high because then many barbers would loose business and this makes hair cutting so much easy. Especially if your a  guy with medium to short length hair. One more advantage is that it saves so much time and energy.

So I lost no time in buttonholing two of my most dubious so-called sources, shady characters who loudly claimed to be alleged Congress insiders and loyalists.*\n\nMe: What did you folks think of the CWC meeting?\n\nAlleged Congressman 1: It was a masterstroke, sheer genius. It will go down in history as a turning point in the history of the party. As I said at the meeting, ‘There is a tide in the affairs of the Congress, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries'.\n\nMe: Good one. Your own?\n\nAC1: Brutus, adapted a bit.\n\nMe: I'm not a big fan of Romans.\n\nAC1: Sorry. We are.\n\nMe: Your party has been losing election after election. You partymen are crossing over to the BJP in droves. You lost Madhya Pradesh and have barely held on to Rajasthan by the skin of your teeth. You haven't managed to elect a full-time party president for over a year. And yet you heckle and shout down anyone who wants change. What on earth are you smoking?\n\nAlleged Congressman 2: Malana cream, I believe.\n\nAC1: Have you read Sun Tzu's Art of War?\n\nMe: I take strong objection to Chinese products. Except Gobi Manchurian.\n\nAC1: Sun Tzu said, ‘The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.' Who would have thought that we would pass up such an opportunity to set our house in order, to signal that we will emerge as a stronger, smarter party? See how we managed to take everybody by surprise, how we fooled them all.\n\nMe: But you did nothing.\n\nAC1: Precisely. We call it masterly drift. We've caught our rivals completely off guard. They have no idea what's coming next. You have no objection to Japanese stuff?\n\nMe: No.\n\nAC1: There's a Zen proverb that goes, ‘Sitting quietly, Doing nothing/Spring comes and the grass grows/By Itself'.\n\nMe: Wah, wah.\n\nAC2: Take the Congress Working Committee. The very name is calculated to sow confusion in the minds of its opponents.\n\nAC1: Because while it is Congress, it is neither a committee, nor can it be accused of working.\n\nMe: Ah.\n\nAC2: You have no objection to America?\n\nMe: No, no, we love Trump.\n\nAC2: This is actually Woody Allen. Altering what he said a bit, ‘More than any other time in history, the Congress party faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness. The other, to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly'.\n\nMe: Eh?\n\nAC1: It's all part of the grand strategy of spreading confusion.\n\nMe: What is your opinion of those Congressmen who wrote that letter demanding change?\n\nAC2: Should they have done it now, at a time when our leaders are in ill health and suffering?\n\nMe: Suffering from what?\n\nAC1: The technical term is electile dysfunction, I believe.\n\nAC2: Also inflammation of the ego.\n\nAC1: At a time when we are fighting against autocracy in the country, everybody needs to rally around the family.\n\nMe: Really?\n\nAC1: You're right. Rahul's men will follow him everywhere, but only out of morbid curiosity.\n\nMe: Yes, yes, but what's the solution?\n\nAC2: We must cast the net wider for our leaders.\nMe: Ah, you too see the need for change then?\n\nAC1: Of course, we're running out of junior flunkeys to blame for all our misfortunes. But we must keep it within the family.\n\nMe: What?\n\nAC2: See, Sonia doesn't want to lead and Rahul can't lead.\n\nAC1: Priyanka too has been dithering.\n\nAC2: In the circumstances, we have to look deeper.\n\nAC1: One place where nobody has thought to look is the next generation---Priyanka Gandhi's kids. They must be in their teens by now.\n\nAC2: They could be our secret weapons, our connection with the millennials, with Gen Z.\n\nAC1: At the next AICC meeting, I'm planning to introduce their names.\n\nAC2: I will second the motion.\n\nMe: Oh, what a brilliant idea, sirjis.\n\nAC2: We have other options too. Rahul could have a radio show called ‘Son ki Baat'.\n\nAC1: If even that doesn't work out, he can always feed peacocks.\n\n#[SOURCE](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/carry-on-congress-5752511.html)"<br />Author: 'proudbhaarateeya'  id: 'igat3s'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/igat3s/carry_on_congress/</li>

Most economists are fairly confident that if India was to stick with their current path they will end up in the #2 or #3 slot in the world for GDP, the trouble is though that a number of other nations would suffer from a stronger India, and that is where the root of a lot of future regional tensions may lie.\n\nOn our panel this week was\n\nSWAMINATHAN AIYAR &gt;&gt; (CATO Institute)  \nDHRUVA JAISHANKAR &gt;&gt; (ORF/Lowy/Brookings)  \nHARSH V PANT &gt;&gt; (London School of Economics)\n\nThis piece is mostly focused on the Indian perspective, particularly when it comes to issues like Kasmir, The Kashmiri Pandits, and the border disputes with China, so I would love to get the other perspectives as well on this one.   \nI think India really does embody the phrase  "If you understand India, someone\'s done a bad job explaining it to you.", so Im sure we will come back to India sometime soon.  \n\nThis sub was absolutely great for research, so thank you to all of the people here.\n\nI would love your input and feedback as well.\n\nSPOTIFY &gt;&gt; [https://open.spotify.com/episode/7tANh3C4yTYim8DNohPrpk?si=-14SBF0aTCyFjW0Q23Ijew](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7tANh3C4yTYim8DNohPrpk?si=-14SBF0aTCyFjW0Q23Ijew)\n\nAPPLE &gt;&gt; [https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/24-who-is-indias-biggest-strategic-enemy/id1482715810?i=1000488945578](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/24-who-is-indias-biggest-strategic-enemy/id1482715810?i=1000488945578)\n\nGOOGLE &gt;&gt;  [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy9mMmU4NTM4L3BvZGNhc3QvcnNz/episode/ZWFlODBhNWQtMTgxYi00ZjRjLTg5YTgtMjAxZWQ5MWMwNWMx?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi\\_8srS7bPrAhXB8zgGHQ6zBUIQkfYCegQIARAF](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy9mMmU4NTM4L3BvZGNhc3QvcnNz/episode/ZWFlODBhNWQtMTgxYi00ZjRjLTg5YTgtMjAxZWQ5MWMwNWMx?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_8srS7bPrAhXB8zgGHQ6zBUIQkfYCegQIARAF) \n\nYOUTUBE &gt;&gt;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fbu1wlapdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fbu1wlapdE) \n\nWEBSITE &gt;&gt; [www.theredlinepodcast.com](http://www.theredlinepodcast.com/)'<br />Author: 'pungrypungryhippo'  id: 'ifobk6'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ifobk6/who_is_indias_biggest_strategic_enemy/</li>

Unlike LKG, UKG and class 1 to 12 which is the usual case in most schools, this school has only three classes - elementary class, intermediate class and secondary class. Elementary class is for 4 years and teacher students all the basic education like language and conversation, numbers, shapes and sizes and environmental studies. Intermediate class teaches little more advanced content in the field of science, math and current affairs which is for 5 years. After completing intermediate school, by the time students would have got exposed to various fields and points of study. They have to choose what subject they like the most and rigorous training on that subject is given to them for 2 years. For example if they choose math, very advanced maths like calculus and trigonometry are taught thoroughly to them. They can then wait for another half year to get their admission for their desired college/university.'<br />Author: 'abhinavram2002'  id: 'iflgjr'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iflgjr/this_was_my_education_system_ideawriteup_long/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Having divorced parents in India is way worse than having parents don't like each other"<br />Body: 'Oh boy, how should I start? \n\n(My english is not that great but still)\nAlso, this is long so...\n\nFirst of all, let me give you some context. Getting a divorce in India is a train wreck and probably way more difficult than any other country. As you would have known that "Marriage" in India is overrated as fuck, It\'s glorified to the godly level. Two family gets involved, they exchange alot of things, all kinds of jewelry, clothes, furniture and sometimes a vehicle or some kind of property. The whole thing is bananas. If you would have visited an Indian wedding you would know how big of a deal it is. So, (according to the families) if you are married, you are married for life. There\'s no going back. \n\nNow, coming back to the point, having divorced parents is way worse for sure. \n\nImagine a scenario where parents don\'t like each other, they fight, they curse and make living hell for each other so, they decide to get divorced. They talk about it to their parents/family, they don\'t like it, they pressurise, they are mad, very mad. But still, they get divorced. Man pays alot of money to the women side, they both have to get shit ton of paper work etc. And now, comes the sufferings: \n-Of women-\nWomen was a housewife, now her parents don\'t accept her, she doesn\'t have a job, basically she is just surviving off of her ex husband\'s money. Society looks upon her with a bit of shame. Probably, people around her don\'t like her and now she has a tag, she\'s  a “Divorcee". Life becomes shit, for that women for sure. She\'s hit bottom of the bottom. \n\n-of man-\nMan was having a job and now have a ton of debt and still has to provide for her ex wife. He also has that "Divorcee" tag and people around him don\'t like him. He\'s hit bottom as well but a bottom above his ex wife. \n\nWoman is suffered way more than man. I have seen shit like this in urban places, imagine getting married in rural places. That\'s why I know people who don\'t get divorce but live seperately with some other partners. It\'s fucked up, but shit like that happens. \n\n\nA child can never see his parents to suffer like this because suffering of a divorce parents is way worse than suffering of a married parents where they don\'t like each other. (Ofcourse not in a worst case, but in most of the cases).\n\nOn the other side, I have seen many couples fight, they don\'t like each other but still they somehow are together. Their families take care of them in that matter. It\'s weird to think like that, but it works. I have seen a couple in my family when fight, fight to the point of killing each other, curse, argue etc. They are together for almost 25 years. It somehow works, most families are joint families unlike in many other countries and they have figured it out. \n\n\nThis is a generalisation, exception are always there. Whatever I have written, I have seen.'<br />Author: 'Sadsoul78'  id: 'iex0m3'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iex0m3/having_divorced_parents_in_india_is_way_worse/</li>

Fed up with it, the victim went back to her hometown in Bareily, UP. But Nizammuddin had been tracking her and deceitfully convinced her to return to Panipat. There, he forced her into marriage. When she refused, he stabbed her in the thigh with a knife.

Look at the various journalists that appear on NDTV. For foreign news channels, look at the Indian correspondents in BBC or Guardian. Very quickly you'd realize that these are people who's ancestors have benefited from the Hindu caste system for ages. \n\nThen you'd ask yourself, why are these people of all people going against Hindu nationalism? **I think the answer is because these people, like their ancestors, never liked inclusion, because that makes them less special. They have always practiced a brand of Hinduism that's very exclusionary.** \n\nWhat that also means is that the current brand of Hindu nationalism is actually very inclusionary. It unifies the various Hindu communities at least in politics if not yet in other aspects of life. It gives the majority of people a singular identity that's important for a nation state.

      <li>Title::: 'Why the British Left Hate India'<br />Body: " [Nirpal Dhaliwal](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/wembley-address-modi-in-uk-modi-not-welcome-david-cameron/story/1/7359.html) \n\nI wept watching Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the British parliament. I found his desi accent difficult to follow, but cried nonetheless. In fact, I wept because of it, raising as it did so many personal issues for me. Watching him, I remembered how my mother - a village girl who left Punjab to wash dishes in London - was treated with disdain and condescension for her poorly spoken English, both by the British and bourgeois Indians who are, to this day, quick to assert social superiority at any instance.\n\nHearing Modi address parliament, Cameron et al paying painstaking attention to his every mispronounced word, spoken in an accent thick enough to cut with a chainsaw, was to sense a personal journey come full circle.\n\nEqually interesting was to see how Britain's media responded to him, to witness how this low-born Leviathan, who speaks English in the manner of curry-house waiter, dredged up various British neuroses - of race, class and nostalgia. Modi proved to be a litmus test of many British anxieties.\n\nThe left-wing press predictably abhorred his visit. *The Guardian* had a nervous breakdown, publishing a series of scathing articles attacking India for its religious intolerance, caste discrimination and oppression of women. Fair enough: all of these problems are unresolved in Indian society and demand reporting. What was telling, however, was that the visit of China's unelected one-party tyrant - sorry, I mean 'president' - two weeks earlier hadn't triggered a similar slew of criticism about that country's myriad human-rights abuses.\n\nThat welcome was reserved for Narendra Modi, who received a bigger democratically decided mandate than any other politician in human history. Indeed, why is it that now, when Indians are more prosperous, open, longer-lived and democratically engaged than ever, the British Left has taken to heaping criticism on India as never before - a contempt pointedly expressed by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, who couldn't stand to be in parliament when Modi gave his historic speech?\n\nIt is, of course, not out of any solidarity with India's poor and suffering millions on whose destinies the British Left has zero influence, people who've never heard of *The Guardian* or Jeremy Corbyn, and for whom *The Guardian* could easily have provided a Hindi-language edition long ago if it were genuinely concerned with empowering them. The neurotic hysteria of Britain's leading left-wing newspaper this past week has a more local and nastier motive.\n\nThe sad truth is that Indians came to Britain and, through much struggle and sacrifice, made a great success of themselves: the British Left - and its trust-funded propagandists at The Guardian - will never forgive them for that. Indian success in Britain, undermining as it does the Left's demented ideologies of race and class, is simply unbearable. Those labels were never going to fit Indians, who don't define themselves within such simplistic limiting boundaries, but for the British Left, to succeed in the face of racism and poverty as most Indians here did, is to commit a crime that cannot be punished enough.\n\nIf Indians in Britain were to riot, lower their academic performance or blow themselves up more, *The Guardian*'s coverage of India would surely be more positive. Of course, they can't focus their ire on British-Indians themselves - the racism would be too obvious - so the motherland is scorned instead. The British Left has a similar relationship with British Jews, another self-made and conspicuously successful minority. The Left's hatred for them reveals itself as an obsessive contempt for Israel - or 'Zionism' as the lefties term it.\n\nNeither the travails of the Indian masses, nor the politics of Israel and its neighbours, are of the slightest interest to the British working-class - the constituency Britain's Left supposedly exists to serve - but they occupy an inordinate amount of space in this country's left-wing psyche. This deeply prejudiced viewpoint is rooted in its neurotic fixation with class and the toxic resentment that stems from that.\n\nA class-based perspective can only see life through the prism of a zero-sum game, an oppressor-victim dynamic. When anyone, particularly those of humble origins - like immigrants from India, for example - achieves success in Britain, the Left can only suspect it took place at someone else's expense. And hence the stewing resentment that finds expression by shovelling scorn on India.\n\nBritain's India-loathing Left has its Indian soulmates, to be sure. Pankaj Mishra and Arundhati Roy have their specially reserved seats in London's liberal salons, where they are regarded as champions of the teeming downtrodden. Of course, neither Mishra or Roy gives a shit about India's masses: if they did, they would write in Hindi or Malayalam, or any of the other vernaculars in which ordinary Indians could actually read and be possibly inspired by them. But they deliberately don't, knowing that the aam admi wouldn't wipe his backside with the shrill whining rubbish they produce.\n\nIndia's poor are merely props for Roy and Mishra's self-styled sainthood among western lefties. And they truly are saints of a twisted sort. Their incessant railings against the liberalising of India's economy - which has lifted millions of Indians out of poverty - is simply the legacy of their uptight Brahmin backgrounds, an inherited revulsion of the material world and the spiritual pollution that comes with trade and manual work. Capitalism, and the physical toil and pleasures that come with it, offends their repressed and febrile high-caste sensibilities, and so they take to the pages of Britain's press to inveigh against it.\n\nBesides these two, *The Guardian* this week also commissioned a ridiculous piece by abstract artist, Anish Kapoor, declaring that India is ruled by a 'Hindu Taliban'. No doubt the editor, Katharine Viner, regards Kapoor as a perfect representative of India's diverse impoverished multitude given that he is a Doon-schooled, London domiciled multimillionaire.\n\nSuch is the warped idiocy behind the British Left and its attitude to India. Even more absurdly, when Modi was elected Prime Minister, the BBC's Newsnight programme brought Kapoor on the show to discuss with William Dalrymple - another elite-schooled millionaire, and one who isn't even Indian - what the election would mean for India's barefooted rural masses. The editor of Newsnight, Ian Katz, previously worked, of course, for *The Guardian*.\n\nThe West's viewpoint of India is profoundly skewed by the fact that English-speaking Indians have historically come from highly privileged and secure backgrounds - people whose views are to be the most distrusted because they are precisely the people most unsettled by India's increasingly upwardly mobile population. I have learned to pay careful attention to the accent with which Indians speak English. When I hear dulcet Rugby-educated tones such as Salman Rushdie's, I know the opinions on offer will resonate within a salubrious south-Delhi enclave and pretty much nowhere else on the subcontinent. When I hear the masala twang of Chetan Bhagat's or Swapan Dasgupta's English, I know I ought to pay attention - just as I did to Modi's tar-thick Hindi-medium accent. These voices, rooted in a broader and more representative India, are deliberately ignored by Britain's left-wing media because they challenge its nonsensical ideologies.\n\nI've focused on *The Guardian*, because it pays more attention to India than the other British papers. The right-wing British press just collectively shrugged and tried to look the other way this week, resigned to Britain's decreasing significance in the world, exemplified by a parliamentary address by a man whose English they couldn't understand.\n\nBut just because someone's paying you a lot of attention, it doesn't mean they like you or have your well-being at heart. And when it comes to India, *The Guardian* most certainly doesn't. I've written for the paper a fair bit myself - though I suspect I won't be again after this article - but I found its coverage this week simply disgraceful. Indians should not mistake the sanctimonious pronouncements by the British Left towards India's many problems - problems that Indians alone can resolve - for a genuine concern for India.\n\nThe British Left is locked in its own parochial neuroses of class and resentment, and its attitude towards India will only ever be a projection of that. Indians are largely an aspirational and enterprising people, and as such will always trigger the disgust of British lefties who are not, and never will be, India's friends."<br />Author: 'Personal_Kangaroo801'  id: 'idtfef'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/idtfef/why_the_british_left_hate_india/</li>

Problem is the market.\n\nThat said, I just came up with an idea: the Navagraha. Nobody has covered that topic. I want to write a manga on it and well.. make it a T.V. show. But there are three problems :\n\n1. Distortion: we all hate this thing. Almost every single mytho is heavily distorted. Nobody even cares of the puran. But here's the deal: purana doesn't always have a continuation. Here we got to make our own. For example: do you know the story of marutta? Brihaspati promised Indra that he would not do rituals to anyone expect Indra. So, he rejected marutta. Marutta went to samvarta, brihaspati's brother+ enemy. When he came to know this, he immediately requested marutta but he refused. All dieties along with lord shiva blessed him except brihaspati. Now tell me, what happened next? Does anyone know? Here you gotta add your own. To sum it up, distortion is fine as long as it doesn't alter the truth or purana.\n\n2. Unfimiliar topic : tell me, how many of you know the story of budha? Or mangal?

I agreed, we looked for a coaching class, found one and I took the class for two weeks before dropping out due to school pressure, Projects + Exams.\n\n*DECEMBER 2019*: I scored good in my pre-board 1 and everything is going smoothly. My father mentions law again, I assure him that I would look into it.\n\n*FEBRUARY 2020*: Board practicals are ending and examinations are going to commence from mid-Feb. At this point, I am engrossed in my CBSE curriculum and hardly give a thought to CLAT.\n\n*MARCH 2020*: My board exams end mid-March and I join a coaching institute. Unfortunately, the classes are shifted online due to Covid Lockdown.\n\n*April 2020:* With great lethargy and disinterest, I attend the online classes. For some reason, sitting through online classes felt like a great burden to me, never felt in physical classroom. I found online classes to be soulless and appalling but I drag on, completing my notes and doing assignments. Due to ongoing situation, CLAT gets postponed.\n\n*May 2020:*  Due to a non-disclosable personal tragedy in May, I retreat into a very dark place mentally. I stop attending the classes and lose my progress with assignments. I spiral down into a cycle of self hatred and procrastination, something I had no experience in dealing with at that point. This continues till early August.\n\n*August 2020:*  Hopefully, through good peer support , self help and giving myself time , I rise back at a much better level mentally. However, I completely lost my progress with my preparation. The CLAT 2020 , scheduled on **September 7**, seem to be a distant dream now.\n\nThe Challenge/Problem/Issue(s)\n\n* I am pretty sure I can't crack CLAT, not a desirable rank at-least. I feel like I should take a drop and get admission in DU ( which takes board % in consideration ) and give CLAT next year again. But in my desi family, taking a drop is a **taboo** topic, it's equivalent to wasting time, also since I have been academically good throughout my school life, I feel like by failing in CLAT I am going to disappoint my family. How do I approach this topic to my family?\n* My family doesn't know about my struggles with mental health, as mental health,  many of you might relate, remains a closed topic in many Indian families. Should I tell them what I think,  that I might not be able to make it to Law school? If yes, Should I tell them this before giving CLAT or after? that i need more time?\n* Is going to DU while simultaneously preparing for CLAT worth it ? or should I stay home and prepare for 2021? Is it cool if I drop out after 1 year and join Law Uni?\n* Have you ever taken drop / know someone who did? how did it turn out?\n\n*NOTE: I can't afford to go to any private university because of our poor financial standing due to Covid-19 as there has been a direct impact on our source of income.*\n\nAll kinds of helpful comments are welcome, be it suggestions, guidance or personal opinion. I understand that it's only up to me what to do in the end, no one else is responsible but perhaps asking someone little experienced, may help this confused teenager to make a better decision."<br />Author: 'another_base'  id: 'idf046'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/idf046/m18_looking_for_some_career_advice_2020/</li>

I discovered that association quite by chance in 1967 when I was an officer on board INS Brahmaputra. My ship was diverted to Taranto owing to a coup against King Constantine in Greece, our original destination. The ship berthed in Taranto in the early hours of a Sunday. There was no one there apart from the shore berthing party of a few men. As time went by, a large number of Taranto’s residents, including several senior citizens, started congregating near the ship. They carried placards welcoming the Indians to Taranto. It was a mystery to us as to why such a crowd was building up.  We were told that the news of the Indian ship’s arrival was announced on the local radio. By the evening, the crowd had swelled. Several residents held placards inviting us to dinners, lunches and picnics.\n\n&gt; I was invited to dinner by the family of the late Ms. Ines Ghosh, the Italian wife of the late Surgeon Rear Admiral J.N. Ghosh, Indian Navy. Ghosh met Ines in Taranto where he was a prisoner of war.\n\n&gt; There I heard heart-rending stories of World War II. They narrated how when the British 8th Army comprising British, Australian, Canadian, Indian and troops of other nationalities invaded southern Italy in July 1943, soldiers from all armies except the Indian Army indulged in rape, molestation and plunder. One of the elderly ladies present told us how she was being chased by two Allied soldiers when an Indian soldier intervened and protected her. He told the chasing soldiers not to harm her because she was his sister! In another instance a posse of Indian soldiers voluntarily guarded an apartment building and prevented soldiers of the other Allied armies from entering it. There were numerous stories of heroism like this. These marvellous episodes bear testimony to the ethical standards and professionalism of the Indian Army.\n\n&gt; The following day there was a special reception in honour of the personnel of our warship INS Brahmaputra at the town hall. When the ship left port finally after four days, virtually the entire town was on the jetty with several bands in attendance to bid adieu. It was a very moving and emotional experience. The ethics of the magnificent Indian Army and its gentlemanly officers and men is still etched in the memory of the citizens of Taranto."<br />Author: 'reddit0r_'  id: 'id6e0g'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/id6e0g/a_story_about_ethically_superior_indian_soldiers/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hi r/IndiaSpeaks! I hope you had a good day. Wanna talk?'<br />Body: 'Hi r/IndiaSpeaks! I hope you had a better day than I did.\n\nI\'ll cut to the chase. Today at lunch, my team and I were discussing SSR murder (kind of celebrating CBI-takeover - she\'s a big *fan*), when an older coworker said it\'s a politically-charged move so BJP can dismantle Maha Govt. Now, this coworker (M50+) is a bit of an outcast and is generally known as a major creep. We made some arguments - it\'s not about Aditya Thackeray. Any party voted in can get voted out if the people of that state have enough of power abuse. Immediately, he threw "*aama su che BJP is anti-Muslim," (????) "Ram Mandir, Kashmir"* and that\'s the hill I choose to die on. (A bit of context: this is the second time this week he mentioned BJP in a completely unrelated conversation. "*Modi killed Khadi industry. Congress did reforms in 1991 &lt;3.*") So, I had to tell him about the increase in scholarships to Muslim students, Trippple Talaq, Niqah money in BJP states, Gays in Kashmir can\'t get flogged, and next year\'s Uniform Civil Code, etc. etc. BJP isn\'t anti-Muslim, and you don\'t want a party like Congress that uses minorities for votes. It\'s unethical and immoral.\n\nWe did a little *garba*, from Adityanath\'s murder cases to BJP now wanting to increase no. of seats to 400. He said Manmohan Singh signed MOUs for Gujarat\'s Highways so he should get credit. It\'s because of Manmohan Singh that Gujarat is so developed. So then I asked why didn\'t MMS do the same for other states which had higher GDP? Look at Maharastra\'s roads? (No offense.) He said other states didn\'t want to spend money. Okayyyyyy.\n\nI told him he wasn\'t being logical about a lot of things. We ended things there as lunch break was over too.\n\nAn hour later, he comes running to my desk. (It\'s funny and adorable because little bish is 140 cm and runs everywhere with no socks). To start with, I\'ve made it clear in the past that I do not want people standing behind me. You wanna talk to me, you come and stand in front of me, not on my head like a boss. He\'s like I wanna show you something important. Okayyyy. He goes on to type "Caste Wise Population in Uttar Pradesh" to show me I was wrong when I said, "UP has the highest Muslim population if they\'re unhappy with Yogi they\'ll vote him out." And that\'s where I lost it. "To start with, I don\'t want to want to have this discussion after lunch. Look at the time - it\'s 2.45 p.m. and you wanna discuss politics instead of work? This is not cool. I\'m going to talk to your manager and don\'t repeat this again." \n\nAnyway, that\'s how I spent my day.

      <li>Title::: "Just read through the details of Rafale deal 'controversy'"<br />Body: 'Hello /r/IndiaSpeaks,\n\nJust wanted to make a post here and share my experience on finally getting to the bottom of the whole Rafale deal \'controversy\' that I kept overhearing from 2016 through the 2019 election. \n\nAlso, if the timing of this reddit post looks weird, that\'s because it is. Personal and professional life circumstances didn\'t leave me with a lot of space to do deep readings of political topics in the country, so I could never really get to the bottom of this particular issue. But finally this past week, after reading over dozens of articles and the summary of the events from the dedicated Wikipedia page, I realized that... this isn\'t even a fucking controversy.\n\nThe core of the allegations by the brain-dead then Congress Party chief RaGa stems from these two aspects of the deal:\n\n* Inflated per-unit cost of the Rafale fighter aircraft under the Inter-Govermental Agreement (IGA) signed in 2016 by the Modi-led NDA government as compared to the cost from the original MRCA deal winner announcement during the UPA regime in 2012.\n\n* The auxiliary \'[offset-contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_agreement)\' that was part of the terms negotiated between [India and France in defence deals](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/rafale-deal-nuts-and-bolts-of-dassaults-offset-partner/317013). This contract in particular involved setting up of a defense/aviation manufacturing facility under a Dassault-Reliance JV in Nagpur. This aspect of \'controversy\' involves, well, controversy around the awarding of the contract to Anil Ambani\'s Reliance Defence ahead of the public sector HAL. The facility in Nagpur currently produces nosecones for Dassault\'s Falcon jets, and would later be [fully capable of producing the Dassault Falcon 2000](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/dassult-to-roll-out-falcon-2000-business-jets-from-nagpur-in-three-years/story/318140.html) business jets, as well as spare parts for India\'s Rafale and Mirage 2000 fleets.\n\nThe first point was fully shot down by both the former defense ministers -- Manohar Parrikar and Nirmala Sitharaman citing Congress\'s lack of awareness about the inflation rate (fixed at 3.5%). That made perfect sense to me as why the fuck would the cost of the aircraft between when the competition winner was first announced in 2012 and when the old terms were scrapped for a brand new deal in the form of the IGA in 2016? As for the second point, the French airplane maker had a freehand in choosing their India partner, and their rationale according to them was because of their preexisting relationship with Reliance defence, back when it was owned by Anil\'s brother Mukesh, and also because of [easy access to an airport runway near a Reliance defence owned facility](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-anil-ambanis-firm-was-registered-had-land-near-airport-dassault-defence-1921482) for easy test flights and logistics.\n\nI\'ll just quote these statements from the top officers of the Indian Air Force that completely demolished the claims of Congress (oh and later they did go on the say that the officers were \'pressured\' by the government):\n\n"**Vice Chief of the Air Staff Shirish Baban Deo** said that the controversy was a result of [ignorance about offset and defence procurement policy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rafales-will-revolutionise-air-power-critics-of-deal-ill-informed-iaf-brass/articleshow/65693937.cms). **Air Marshal Raghunath Nambiar** also spoke in support of the deal, saying that the people alleging price escalation were not aware of the details that officers of Indian Air Force had access to, as a result of their involvement in price negotiations. He said that the price in the IGA was lower than what was offered in 2008 and [there was no favouritism in the distribution of offset contracts](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/allegations-rafale-deal-dont-691374.html)."\n\n\nMore quotes from defence minister that further exposes the bs behind Congress\'s claim: \n\n"Nirmala Sitharaman said that the older deal broke down as the cost for aircraft produced locally [would have increased significantly, far more than the cost of aircraft produced in France](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/poor-health-of-hal-led-to-collapse-of-rafale-deal-under-upa-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/65799175.cms). She added that Dassault refused to warranty the jets and HAL couldn\'t take over the warranty. She said that the figure of ₹526 crore quoted by Congress represented the cost of basic aircraft and did not include the cost of associated items required to make it operational."\n\nGlad I was able to reach the bottom of this \'controversy,\' and get the full picture.

      <li>Title::: 'No True Right-Winger'<br />Body: "I think the government's response to COVID-19 has made one thing clear: there is no right wing in India.\n\nFor three months, draconian limits on personal and civil liberties were imposed on us; thousands of helpless people had to walk hundreds of miles with their children, without food, water, and covering, just to be able to survive; thousands of small businesses and mom-and-pop stores, built with the sweat and tears of normal people destroyed knowingly; a population already depressed by unemployment and economic bleakness locked in the isolation wards of their homes to be consumed by their minds; and, an economy that was already struggling according to some reports was pushed into a crisis worse than the 2008 crash. All man-caused, avoidable.\n\nI, like most people, initially supported the lockdown. In fact, when things opened back in June, I felt we shouldn't have unlocked so early. But the reason was that I was ignorant. I hadn't looked at what the other side was saying, I didn't know there was another side because no one told me there was.\n\nOur government, instead of giving people what they need, gave into the hysteria that the people had worked themselves into based on WhatsApp forwards and dodgy news channels. Don't you dare point out that most of the world did the same. A mistake is a mistake even if everyone makes it; a disaster is a disaster even if the whole world walks into it. And it's not like we didn't have examples - we had Sweden and South Korea.\n\nBut do you know what the Western world had during this that we didn't? People questioning the government's decision. If there were people, the normal people didn't get to hear their side.\n\nNot one of our 'right wing' stalwarts stood up for personal liberty and the right to move freely. Not one of them tried to inform people that the hysteria was unjustified and that the government was taking away their most basic and fundamental right: that of a citizen to freely move in their own country. Most of them actually mislead the public and told them to throw themselves in the arm of Big Brother because they know what they're doing, don't they? Modi ji ne kiya hai, to kuch soch ke hi kiya hoga.\n\nWrong. Our government (yes, including Narendra Modi) simply followed the Western world into hysteria that was ultimately based on a [hypocritical](https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/05/hypocritical-elitist-wants-everything-locked-down-except-marriages/) leftist professor's [faulty work](https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/18/how-blind-faith-in-scientific-expertise-wrecked-the-economy/) which [he himself has walked back on](https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/26/the-scientist-whose-doomsday-pandemic-model-predicted-armageddon-just-walked-back-the-apocalyptic-predictions/). Oh, and that professor had a history of faulty predictions and the criticism of his model [was censored](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/revealed-uk-scientists-fury-over-attempt-to-censor-covid-19-advice?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&amp;__twitter_impression=true). Our right wing should have fought for personal liberty and questioned the wartime-like measures being imposed on us based on facts like the right wing in the Western world was doing, but instead they jumped into the lap of Big Brother. That is not what the right wing is supposed to do.\n\nNo one asked what the impact of the lockdown would be or if it would be justified. How it would affect people economically, and mentally. If anyone did, the 'right wing' government didn't care.\n\nThe right wing's job is to guard against government overreach but not in our country. In our country, the 'right wing' runs to the government whenever they want their critics silenced. They complain about Babur to their daddy, the government. That's no true right wing.\n\nLet's set this straight: if you're not against big government and for personal liberty of movement and speech (including speech bashing Ram), then you're not right wing. You're just a religious socialist.\n\n- A Lolbertarian\n\n**FURTHER LEARNING:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogeVM3JsJoM\n\nhttps://www.spectator.co.uk/article/never-has-a-virus-been-so-oversold\n\nhttps://www.spectator.co.uk/article/what-is-behind-the-rise-of-deaths-in-private-homes-\n\nhttps://www.spectator.co.uk/article/lockdowns-are-as-contagious-as-covid"<br />Author: 'justinmegas'  id: 'icgpew'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/icgpew/no_true_rightwinger/</li>

Wouldn't custom cut increase imports a lot as the imports are now cheaper and higher excise duty make the domestic products costlier? Instead of making a country lessen its dependence on imports, wouldn't these changes increase that dependence?

post,*\n\n# our transport safety guidelines are very backdated and so is the training given to drivers.\n\n* the crash tests done are only frontal and apply to vehicles sold from June 2019 passenger vehicles only no such tests for heavy vehicles, busses, smaller vehicles like commercial vans autos, bikes which means a huge chunk of cars which run on our roads were never tested for safety including most vehicles sold before 2019\n\nI would commend global NCAP for at least testing vehicles sold in India but even their testing is just for the frontal collisions only\n\nno tests are done for side collisions(the second biggest cause of death in a crash ), rear-end collisions or rollover crashes\n\nto put it simply a car can get good scores in global NCAP testing but get very poor scores in EuroNCAP *or like this global NCAP is class 10 maths and EuroNCAP is class 12 maths*\n\nalso, the lack of safety equipment required in India is a big differentiator among the chances of surviving the crash or getting into one in the first place.\n\ncars need one driver airbag only in India to be approved for sale, these were the requirements for the first-ever EuroNCAP way back in 1997 &amp; 1979, NHTSA (USA)\n\nno crash-avoidance tech needed\n\nno need to have automatic speed-sensitive braking which prevents head-on collision by braking the car itself at lower speeds\n\nblind-spot monitoring\n\nemergency alert for when the vehicle senses a crash an alert is sent to the emergency department\n\nshock absorbing body frame (crump\\[le zones )\n\nusability of the vehicle after a crash is also tested in EuroNCAP which means is the vehicle unable after repairs or not and how much strength will the body have\n\n# lack of any periodic fitness tests\n\nit is a common sight to see people doing makeshift repairs to vehicles and running without working equipment in many parts of India\n\nnonworking brakes\n\nweakened chassis which may snap in case of stress\n\nrunning on really old worn out tires, which can burst anytime\n\nhandling issues like not able to turn or maneuver the vehicle due to broken steering\n\nsharp objects that can cause cuts to passengers or impale pedestrians, other vehicles like rods or bumper guards which are rigid\n\na regular test is done by government authority about the safety of vehicles to prove its roadworthiness like the yearly MOT done in the UK\n\nthis could be a good revenue-generating opportunity for the transport department these tests prevent vehicle failure while they are on roads and removing vehicles who are unfit for road use\n\nas people are always being stingy with the upkeep of their vehicles usually commercial ones even more as they have to reduce cost busses are known to puncture a tire and skid on the road or brake fade\n\n# proper training for a license\n\nmost tests in India are just driving in a closed path and parking the vehicle and that\'s it you get your license\n\nwe are not

the most accidents happening in India that accidents per 100,000 residents is much lower in India when compared to neighboring countries, saying that only busses in winter get into an accident a few days after this a relative of mine was hit by a lorry it was night time and so due to lack of visibility he crossed the road and the truck just hit him he died there he was 2-3 years older than me I feel bad all the shit talk I did and it\'s not the first time a couple of seniors and friends had been injured in accidents a few scuffs may be a bruises a one senior who was racing on the road in his

      <li>Title::: 'Book review - Decolonising the hindu mind by Koenraad Elst'<br />Body: '**Book Blurb -** \n\nThe ideological dimension of Hindu revivalism has mostly been misinterpreted, or rather neglected in the ongoing debates on the subject. Thoroughly analysing the ideological statements of its advcates and their critique of existing secular order, Dr Koenraad Elst provides an overview of ideas animating the movement.\n\nAperiod of rapid political changes that witnessed the rise of BJP with only 2 Lok Sabha seats in 1984 to 179-which enabled it to form a coalition government in 1998-is the focus of the study. Amidst the several other books available on the subject, this book stands out with its clear focus and clarity of thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Review -**\n\nThe book is divided into 6 parts by the author.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt starts with pointing out some problematic terminology, words that have been misinterpreted or rather misused grossly, such as "Hindu Revivalism", "Hindutva", "Secularism", "Hindu Nationalism", "Hindu fundamentalist and traditonalist", Gandhian secularism", "Marxism", among some others. The author explains how these words came into being and what they actually mean. The author also provides detailed account of how these words have wrongly used by politicians, academics, media(both Indian and Foreign), to portray hindu organizations in a bad light. The author argues how India has never truly been secular in the western sense because of "appeasement". The author cites several cases such as "Satanic verses" and \'Shah Bano case" to expose the situation. He also brings in light the control of Marxism in Indian politics, academics and the media. He then goes on to expose the unabashed bias of the media and people writing regarding the situation (Asghar Ali Engineer, Romila Thapar, etc.) within and outside India against the Hindus, and favoring the muslims in the name of "Secularism". He shows how the hindu voices have been ignored in discussion of relevant cases and how they have been wrongly accused of being "communal" whereas the people being favored are the ones blatantly advocating such policies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, an entire chapter is dedicated to historical survey to give a factual framework of historical data concerning the protagonists of hindu revivalist politics and ideology. He starts by calling it "Hindu Renaissance". He mentions the very first organizations and individuals who led the hindu revivalist politics and ideology, he mentions brahmo samaj, arya samaj, swami vivekananda, sri aurobindo among others. He briefly mentions their stance on hindu revivalism, activites undertaken by them, and how they differed from each other. Next he talks about mostly the political organizations and individuals who are relevant to the topic. He brings up congress and muslim league and shows the appeasement towards muslims, talks about how early hindu mahasabha was inclined towards orthodox and conservative line and how it reformed after the rise of Savarkar. He mentions the murder of mahatma gandhi and how the hindu organizations were cracked down. Next, he shifts his focus on the sangh parivar and the emminent personalities. He focuses on the Jana Sangh, their formation, their commitments, role of people like Deendayal Upadhyaya and Balraj Madhok and their role in the emergency time. Next comes the BJP, which is discussed in detail, about how it was formed, what it stood for, and how it was different from existing hindu organizations, and how it rose to power. He debunks the popular argument that the bjp is "communal" or "pro-caste system" using several examples. He also briefly mentions Vishwa Hindu Parishad\'s stance on Hindu agenda. Lastly he mentions some related parties, such as the swatantra party, shiv sena, discussing their ideologies.Lastly, independant hindu authors, their works against communists and in favor of hindu revivalist movement, and how they have been largely neglected in the relevant discussions and termed as "communal". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next part talks about the ideology and polemic in the organized hindu movement, the author, in detail, criticizes the sangh\'s anti intellectualism, and shows how this has hampered in bringing out the hindu\'s side of the story,how their no media presence has hurt them dearly in important events such as emergency and the ayodhya episode, and same scheme has been followed by the BJP as well. The author talks about hindu criticism of the RSS for this anti intellectual stance, he sources extensively from Sita Ram Goel and Abhas Chatterjee to show the shortcomings of the sangh [parivar. Next](https://parivar.Next) he talks about sangh and non sangh polemic against christianity, marxism, communism, and islam, all leading to the conclusion that they have been exceptionally weak polemics carried out by the sangh, and very limited by the non sangh hindus as well, whereas the sangh is attacked viciously by their opponents. He talks about Islam in detail, and shows how the stance taken by the sangh is no less than appeasement, and goes on to prove how the sangh is more nationalistic than hindu as claimed by their opponents. He junks the notion that "Islam is egalitarian" which is generally towed by marxist and islam apologetics using ample evidence from previous writings, and exposes the evils of the mughal rulers.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end parts of the book, the author discusses the idea of a Hindu stae, Hindu nation. He discusses the idea of hindu nationalism as given by people like Sri Aurobindo, and how it equates to indian nationalism. Then he looks at the views of some other writers such as Arun Shourie, Balraj Madhok, V.D. Savarkar on the subject and finally the RSS and BJP views on this, and how they have no clarity on this subject which has harmed them severely and a lot of hindu revivalists feel let down by such approach from the perceived hindu organizations. He also looks at the polemics of nehruvian secularists and marxists against this idea of hindu revivalists. Finally the author turns towards the specific hindu grievances against the policies adopted, he mentions the injustice in discourse, regarding hindu victims of the kashmir violence, and other communal violence and shows how the media happily adopts the version bashing the hindus even if it is not supported by any facts whatsover, but tends to shy away when muslims are in question, also mentions how BJP and the hindus have been demonized by accusing them of absurd things which are often too exaggerated, but nonetheless find acceptance. Then he talks about legal discrimiation by citing article 30, and some other articles along the same lines, he talks about conversion laws, state control over the temples, talks about lack of a common civil code, and exposes the hypocrisy of the secularists on this issue, and how bjp has the only one who has been in support of this law, but it has preferred to stay away from it for various reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, this is a very good read, full of insights and deep exploration into sensitive issues that have plagues the hindus for decades. A much needed reality check for the so called hindu organizations such as RSS, why they have an image as we see today, what they lack in their strategy. Explores how certain self proclaimed secularists have hounded out certain people and organizations from key instituions because they dont fit their flawed version of secularism, etc. I felt that the book is very well researched, and brings forth things and ideas that wouldn\'t normally come up because of how the system has worked for decades. I would suggest everyone interested in this subject to read it.'<br />Author: 'eternalrocket'  id: 'iaui4p'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iaui4p/book_review_decolonising_the_hindu_mind_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I see many people talking about how India should help Balochistan in seceding. So, I decided to do an analysis upon the subject. (OC)'<br />Body: 'Should India “Realistically” Help Balochistan?\n\nI would like to start off by just saying one thing, the process of seceding Balochistan from Pakistan requires a lot of blood and money, with lesser chance of a gain at the end.\n\n\nNow I would like to give a point by point rebuttal to all of the points that people normally discuss to show why India should help Balochistan.\n\n\nIndia should help Balochistan as it betrayed the country during the time of independence.\n\nThat is true, India didn’t help Balochistan, back in those days and let Pakistan invade it, actually I am not so sure about the invading part, as I am not able to get trusted sources to prove it, so let’s just assume that they either invaded it or forcefully integrated it.\n\nAs I said in the first line of this article, war is only wagered if the side who starts it, feels that they would be able to get an advantage from it, along with lesser losses. But, according to what I have researched, there is no way in hell that Balochistan can be freed without the martyring of thousands of soldiers, economic burden and maybe even worsened relations with countries, and even at a chance of WW3, and the advantages aren’t exactly viable, to say the least.\n\nIndia should help, as Pakistan itself, is provoking the population of Kashmir.\n\nMy rebuttal to this phrase would be basically that, India is not at all like Pakistan, if you get what I mean. India cares way more about its future economy, stability, and the support of the people, which are the traits that you have to take care of in a functional democracy. Pakistan, however, is a government which is a puppet of a military dictatorship, definitely they too have to keep the people happy, but more of their GDP goes towards the military, and paying back debts that they have piled up throughout the years, and also that India also wants to keep a steady relationship with far away, and nearby neighbours such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Russia, United States Of America and The European Union, to slow down the influence of China. So wagering war, may worsen these relations, or make them better, it is more of a debatable topic, to say the least.\n\nThe seceding of Balochistan will break the back of the Pakistani’s\n\nThat is a correct statement, however it doesn’t take into consideration that the same/ a similar toll will also be on the back of India, as, if you look at the graphs of previous wars throughout the years(Indo-Pakistani Wars), then you may see that economic growth stayed stale for 1-2 years, or just that specific year.\n\nProof: War of 1947: I think that taking that war into consideration would be a little unfair because not only was India going through an economic burden like most countries do after independence but also as there aren’t many sources showing the economic growth of that time, most start of from 1951.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0War of 1965: The GDP growth rate for 1964 was\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 7.45% and then in 1965 it stooped down to -2.64% and in 1966, it still stayed stale at 0.06%.\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0War of 1971: The GDP growth rate for 1970 was 5.16% and then in 1971 it stooped down to 1.64% and then it again stooped down to 0.66% in 1972.\n\nThe source to the data: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/gdp-growth-rate\n\nSo, basically my point is that, Balochistan’s independence is hard to say the least, and in my opinion, time will only tell whether Balochistan will get to call itself a nation.\n\n\nThank you for reading\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0-Aryaman Singh'<br />Author: 'Generocide'  id: 'iasvwv'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iasvwv/i_see_many_people_talking_about_how_india_should/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[CMV] There is no such thing such as urdu language, Indian Muslim culture and Ganga-Jamuna tahjeeb in India.'<br />Body: 'In the political context of northern India the idea of urdu language, muslim culture, Ganga-Yamuna tahjeeb are often invoked to defend the ideal of secularism in Indian constitution and how its operationalized in politics, policies, and media.\n\nTo clarify this is not a debate about whether India should be a secular country or not. Secularism can have other justifications. \n\nThis is also not a debate about whether India is a multicultural society or not. I believe India is a multicultural society irrespective of what our position in the debate is. \n\nAnd, finally this debate makes sense mostly in context of northern India especially Gangetic belt. \n\nTo me the question is one of empirical nature. \n\nIt essentially asks, given all the evidence is it correct to say urdu constitute a separate language or is it mostly hindi written in a different script and with some Persian loanwords? To me the second answer makes more sense and looks closer to the empirical truth. We make lesser error going with the second one.\n\nSimilarly when we ask what is the better way to describe north Indian culture. Is it a syncretic culture having a mix of native and central Asian culture or is it predominantly native culture with negligible elements from foreign sources? To me again the second answer looks closer to the empirical reality.\n\nGanga-jamuna tahjeeb like any other abstraction tries to capture general idea rather than minor variations. In describing north Indian culture as syncretic we make two mistakes: 1. It is empirically incorrect 2. We are magnifying the central asian elements and minimizing native elements.'<br />Author: 'yonhi'  id: 'iaqita'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iaqita/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_such_as_urdu_language/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] Gun ownership laws should be relaxed in India'<br />Body: 'Arms Act, 1959 [1] [3 a] regulates the possession, carry, manufacture and sale of firearms in India. It requires a person to have a license to possess and carry a firearm with certain exceptions.  Section 13, sub-section 3 [1] talks about the grant of licenses and reasons for the same. A license can be issued for "protection or sport or in respect of a muzzle loading gun to be used for bona fide crop protection" if "the licensing authority is satisfied that the person by whom the licence is required has a good reason for obtaining the same". It leaves the power of deciding what a "good reason" for owning a firearm may be to the licensing authority.  \n\nThis has made it extremely difficult to possess a firearm and opens a window of corruption to obtain a license.  India ranks 120th [2] in the list of most armed countries with 5 civilian firearms per 100 citizens. \n\nSome places with less gun control:\n\n1. USA [3 b]: There are several federal, state and local codes and authorities controlling possesion, carry, manufacture, sale, etc of firearms, but the right to keep and bear firearms is protected by the 2nd Amendment. Different states have different degrees of gun control but most have much less gun control than India. \n\n2. Switzerland [3 c]: has one of the most liberal gun laws in the world. It allows acquisition of following weapons without a permit:\n&gt; -Single-shot and multi-barreled hunting rifles and replicas of single-shot muzzle loaders.\n&gt; -Hand bolt-action rifles, which are commonly used in off-duty and sporting gunnery recognized by the military law of 3 February 1952 and shooting clubs for hunting purposes in Switzerland.\n&gt; -Single-shot rabbit slayer.\n&gt; -Compressed air and CO2 weapons that develop a muzzle energy of at least 7.5 joules, or their appearance may be mistaken for real firearms.\n\nRest can be permitted on a shall/may-issue basis.\n\n3. Coorg District in India [1]: The Kodavas in Coorg District of India are exempted from the Arms Act and don\'t require a license for pistols, revolvers and double-barreled shotguns (because of their faith: they worship weapons during Kailpodh festival. \n\nSome points for the motion:\n\n1. Gun control only creates a disparity between lawful citizens and criminals, which increases crimes.\n2. Poor policing, reporting and slow courts makes crime rate skewed down - in reality it is much higher [4]; hence the crime rate wouldn\'t increase drastically [5] if gun ownership laws are relaxed, which is evident in Coorg district of India [6].\n3. They act as a deterrent for internal and external enemies: a tyrannical ruler and intrusion by land forces of a foreign power respectively.\n\nSome points against the motion:\n\n1. Improving policing and courts should be done to solve the problem of crime instead of aiming for an armed citizenry.\n2. Less gun control might make anti-India forces violent and government will face difficulty in controlling them.\n3. Liberal gun laws have negative effects for the society which are more probable than having a tyrannical ruler, and hence such a threat isn\'t a convincing positive for loosening gun control.\n\nThe motion proposes gun ownership laws should be relaxed in India.\n \n*[for] Those who are in support of the motion.*\n \nor\n \n*[Against] Those who are not in support of the motion.*\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n**Rules:**\n \n* Pick a side - For or Against (Based off the topic/what you want to defend).

      <li>Title::: 'What to do about abusive father?'<br />Body: "My alcoholic father has been abusive towards mainly my mother and me as well but to a lesser degree, ever since I was like 9 years old. I am 21 now. \n\nHe used to work earlier but he stopped 7 or so years ago. Now he just hejust roams around, drinks alcohol and harasses us. \n\nHe used to chronically physically abuse her quite often from when l was that age (9) upto my mid teens. He toned the physical abuse down quite a bit after that but he continued with the verbal abuse. \n\nWhen I was 18 he was harassing my mother(verbally) and I beat him up and gave him a blue eye. After that, if I was around whenever he would be verbally abusing my mother, he would treaten to kill me or beat me up or try to intimidate me with a kitchen knife or other utensils and sometimes without any objects as well. \n\nSo fast forward to 4th night of this month, he was yelling/harassing my mother and forcefully pulled (and tore) her chunni from her neck in the kitchen. I arrived a few minutes after this had happened and he started shouting/harassing me as well after that. \n\nWhile he was doing this he stepped closer towards me in a way that it seemed like he was about to hit me (His body language was such) but he didn't at that moment although he probably would have later. \n\nHe stepped away and for some reason he went outside the room(kitchen) and we immediately shut the door from inside and called the police. He kept trying to break the door and yelling loudly and verbally abusing us from outside. \n\nWhen the police arrived they rebuked him and made him sign a statement on plain paper which says that he won't harass his family, won't hit my mother and won't drink alcohol for a year. They also said that they will arrest him if he does something to my mother again. \n\nI had done some research and knew that Indian police doesn't register FIRs easily. We both weren't sure if we should escalate further or not so we didn't pester them to write an FIR either. \n\nHe kept his mouth shut until now, but today he abused my mother again verbally in the afternoon. \n\nIn the evening my father's mother(my grandmother) was sitting outside in the balcony and he(father) started talking to her about this 4th of August incident and saying that he had talked to a policewalla and he(the policeman) told him It's no big deal if these two call the police you will get bail easily. This seems to have emboldened him a bit. \n\nWe want to leave him but my mother doesn't want to live in rented accomodation and she doesn't have enough money to buy her own house. The only reason why we are stuck with him is finances. \n\nThe house we live in is owned by my father's mother(grandmother) and she isn't nice either. \n\nConclusion: \n\nMy father is abusive and all of his abuse has afflicted my and my mother's mental and physical health severely but we are stuck with him for the time being due to lack of sufficient funds. \n\nHe has agricultural land worth 10-20 lakh in his name which he inherited from his father. Would it in any way be possible for us to claim it in court? \n\nAs far as I've read online it seems like the wife is not eligible to claim property inherited by the husband but can we do so on the basis of him being abusive? \n\nSecondly, I know this is highly unlikely but just to be sure- can the statement on plain paper that the policemen made him sign be used as evidence of abuse?\n\nMy mother's friend went through her divorce recently and told her that a daughter in law can also claim mother in laws pension? Is this true? She(mother's friend) said that the court was alloting her half her MILs pension but she refused? Because I don't think this is true. We are very unlikely to claim her (grandmother's) pension but it's just something I would like to know anyways. \n\nAlso, If there‘s anything else apart from this that I should be know then please do tell me. I would be very grateful."<br />Author: 'throwaway577226355'  id: 'iac3le'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iac3le/what_to_do_about_abusive_father/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Independence Day: Begumpura to Bhajanpura'<br />Body: ' \n\nTHE TERM *Be-gum-pura* (no-sorrow-place or the land without sorrow) is a utopia upheld by radical *Bhakti* poet Ravidass (1450-1520). *Begumpura* is a city that is casteless, classless and does not have untouchability. In this city, nobody is taxed and nobody owns wealth; there is no injustice, no worries, no terror, and no torture.\n\nConceptually *Begumpura* is a lode-star to guide humanity beyond the barriers of discrimination towards equality. Ravidassia and other Dalit scholars argue that *Begumpura* is the original socialism envisaged in the 15th century. Yes, truly Ravidass and *Begumpura* is a far reaching idea, a weapon to emancipate the non-privileged.\n\nIn that sense, *Begumpura* also becomes the voice of all oppressed. Today, on the 73rd anniversary of India’s freedom from British, one can read our freedom struggle as a search for *Begumpura*.'<br />Author: 'Amritpal_31'  id: 'ia2o7a'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ia2o7a/independence_day_begumpura_to_bhajanpura/</li>

Students are never encouraged to explore their own way or come up with a method that works for them as individuals.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic, let us not forget that much like our laws, the current education system is also highly influenced by our colonial past. The britishers modernised the education system with the aim of recruiting educated indians to british administrative posts to carry out day to day tasks.\n\nThus, it was an education system that promoted conformist and bourgeoisie ideals, lest the Indians should oppose the rule of the company and think for themselves.\n\n*This is an excerpt from an article in Alfaaz magazine.

If you are not prepared to stand by your words, where will independence be?" \n\nJust after a year, in lahore after british didn\'t comply to the chaplushi demands of congress, nehru and gandhi declared PURNA SWARAJ at the bank of river ravi..\n\nThe sheer hypocrisy was that,the guy(netaji) who was asking continuously for purna swaraj from day one of his political career,was nowhere to be found.\n\n\nAnd about purna swaraj which was started/mainstreamed by bal gangadhar tilak ji,later propagated by netaji and many other leaders was not the swaraj gandhi,nehru duo put forward.\nNetaji had to go for war because his version of purna swaraj was nothing alike the version nehru proposed.\n\n\nSo finally *** yes!we celebrate 15 th august as independence day.but sad thing is,we didn\'t earn it.***\n\n\n\nConstructive and destructive criticism will be appreciated.

      <li>Title::: "चोरी TL'dr"<br />Body: 'मैं जब छोटा था ... मतलब यही कोई 14 या 15 साल का .... तो मैंने अपनी जिंदगी की पहली और आख़री चोरी की ...।।\n\nइस चोरी ने चोरी करने तक मुझे बेहद सुकून दिया... चोरी करने के दो घण्टे बाद तक ये सुकून बना हुआ था ....\n\nचोरी होने के 5 घण्टे बाद मुझे आत्मग्लानि होनी शुरू हुई .... और ये 3 दिन में इतनी चरम में पहुँच गई कि मुझे अपने हाथों को अपने जिस्म से अलग काटकर फेंकने की प्रबल इच्छा हुई .....\n\nभेद फिर भी नही खुला....\n\n2000 रुपये आज सिर्फ एक पिंक वाला बड़ा नोट लेकिन उस वक्त ये 100 -100 के 20 बड़े नोट थे ....\n\nचौथे दिन तक परिवार में चोर का कोई सुराग हाथ नही लगा ....लेकिन मैंने पूरा प्रयास किया कि चोर अज्ञात ही रहे ....\n\nघर में एक खामोश अशांति सी बरपा हो गई ... मेरे वालिद साहब के चेहरे पर हवाइयां उड़ी हुई थी ...\n\nमेरी वालिदा मुबारक के रह -रहकर आँसू बह रहे थे ...\n\nमेरे दोनों भाई -बहन एक अपरिचित मुद्रा में हतप्रभ थे ...\n\nलेकिन मुझे सुकून नही था ....\n\nमैं खुद को धिक्कार तो रहा था ...लेकिन घर से बाहर कदम निकालने पर मुझे ऐसा लगता कि हर कोई मेरी तरफ देख रहा है ...\n\nहर आँख में मुझे अपने लिए घिन दिख रही थी ...हर होंठ मुझे देख कुछ बुदबुदा रहे थे ....\n\nये चोरी तब थी जब मेरे वालिद साहब का सब्जी का छोटा सा कारोबार चरमरा गया था ...\n\nमुझे ज्ञात था ये दो हजार उन्होंने फिर एक नव प्रयास की उम्मीद में जमा किये थे ...\n\nमैं अथाह पीढ़ा में था ...संतोष मुझसे अलग खड़े होकर मेरी हँसी उड़ा रहा था ..... मन के निर्मम दाँत लगातार मेरा कलेजा चबा रहे थे ..\n\nमैं अल्लाह से हर वक्त माफी के मॉड में ऑन था ... मुझे अब हर वक्त किसी चमत्कार की उम्मीद थी ...मैं कल्पनाओं के जंगल में खोकर ये भी भ्रम पालने लगा कि जादू -टोटका ही अब मेरी कोई मदद कर सकता है ....जबकि यही अन्धविश्वास वजह थी .. मेरे जमीर के ढहने की !!\n\nलेकिन अफसोस मुझे कोई जादुगर नही मिला ...न ही कोई पुख्ता तंत्र या मंत्र .....\n\n6 दिन लग गये थे चोरी को ...लेकिन घर अब भी उस चोरी से लाल था ...ये भयानक चोरी हमारी पुर्नस्थापना पर एक सवाल जो बन गया थी ...\n\nमेरे पाप की जटाएं मेरे पूरे परिवार के भविष्य का रक्त चूस रही थी .... मैं अकथ्य का पात्र बनकर जब घर की रोटी ..डलिया से उठाता तो मेरा हाथ इतना भारी हो जाता कि मैं बेशर्मी से अपना दूसरा हाथ उस हाथ को सहायतार्थ आगे करता जिससे मैंने चोरी की थी .....\n\nवालिदा का दिन-प्रतिदिन बिगड़ता स्वास्थ्य .. ..सर पर ईद ... सरकारी स्कूल की छटाँग फीस..... और ध्वस्त हुए कारोबार के अवशेष मुझसे अनेकों सवाल करते ....और मैं कूपमण्डूक की भाँति उस चमत्कार की प्रतीक्षा करता ज़िस निमित्त मैंने चौर्यकर्म को प्राथमिकता दी ।\n\nजीवन ने पहली बार बड़ी सघनता से मेरी आँख में उतरकर मुझे पैसे की औकात बताई ..और जीवन में पहली बार मैंने पैसा कमाने को वरीयता दी ....\n\nउम्र के हिसाब से मैं कर क्या सकता था ... कुछ भी तो नही ...जब इस देश में ..पी. एच. डी स्कॉलर्स सड़क नाप रहें हैं तो मेरे लिए वो कौनसा कर्म सुनिश्चित था कि जो मेरे डांके की त्वरित क्षति पूर्ति करता ....\n\nमैंने अपनी वालिदा को बचपन से लेकर आज तक बीमार देखा ...शर्तिया जीता हुआ सट्टा समझ लें कि वो महीने के सिर्फ 7 से 8 दिन स्वस्थ्य जैसी दिखतीं हैं ...\n\nआंठवें दिन मैंने एक रेहड़ी पर हेल्पर की भूमिका का निर्वहन किया ...रेहड़ी जो नही समझते वो जाने कि जिस गाड़ी के चार पहिये होते हैं और जिसमें इंजन और स्टीयरिंग नही होता ...और ये गाड़ी देश के हम जैसे भुक्खड़ों को अपने अविष्कार से आज तक पालती रही है ।\n\nदेश की सीधी समतल सड़के रेहड़ी को यातायात का एक माध्यम बनाती हैं लेकिन उतार-चढ़ाव से लबरेज पहाड़ी बाजार रीढ़ से पसीना निकवाल देते हैं जब कुन्तलों आम ..अमरूद ..लीची इसपर लादी जाती है ...और इसे धक्का देकर दौड़ाना होता है ।\n\nमेरा पहला रोजगार सफल रहा और मुझे 15 रुपये नकद प्राप्त हुए ...जिसे मैंने अपनी अम्मी के हाथ में लाकर रखा.. और तुरन्त निकाली कलम और 2000 से 15 माईनस किये ....\n\n\nउसी दिन शाम को ईश्वरीय चमत्कार हुआ और मुझे पुनश्च रोजगार मिला ..एक घर में पुताई की छींट साफ करने का और इसके लिए मुझे 20 रुपये मिलने तय हुए ...\n\nसुबह 4 बजे इसे लेकर घर आया ..और अम्मी का चमाट खाकर बिस्तर पर गिर गया ...\n\nअम्मी से झूठ बोलकर गया था ..कि अपने मित्र के घर ग्रीष्मावकाश गृह कार्य पूर्ण करने जा रहा हूँ ....\n\nबिस्तर पर गिरकर फिर आँख खुली 11 बजे .. उठते ही 20 फिर माइनस किये और तुरन्त पहुँचा रेहड़ी में ... और काम पर विलंब से पहुँचने पर चार पहियों के चलते रोजगार से मुझे तत्काल फायर किया गया ...\n\nफायर होने का दृश्य बड़ा भावुक था ...मैं कई कदम रियल ऑनर ऑफ रेहड़ी के पीछे चलता रहा कि वो मुझे पुनश्च काम पर रख ले ...\n\n\n\nउसी दिन पता चला कि ये देश गांधी का है ... मतलब जहाँ कुछ नही फँसता वहाँ गाँधी डाल कर काम चल जाता है ... वक्त की इज्जत करने की बात बापू बोले या नही बोले ...लेकिन जो भी सकारात्मक विचार हो उसे आप कितना प्रचार कर लो वो टुच्चा ही माना जायेगा...\nगाँधी का नाम लेकर चेप दो ..., वो राष्ट्रीय स्लोगन बन जायेगा ...\n\nगाँधी का नाम इसलिए बीच में ले आया ...क्यूँकि गाँधी के नाम पर तत्कालीन किसी व्यक्ति ने कोई प्रतियोगिता रखी थी ....\n\nउसके पर्चे शहर में बांटने थे ...पूरे 15 रुपये मिलते ...और मैंने वो हड़प लिए ...\n\n2000 से कमाई माइनस करने का फिर जो सिलसिला चला ...उसने मुझे स्कूल और किताबों से दूर कर दिया ....\n\n\nआज मैं भले ही कहानी सुनाता हूँ ... मुट्ठीभर लोग उन्हें पढ़ते हैं..और मेरी सरहाना करते हैं ..\n\nवो भी हैं जो पढ़ते हैं ..लेकिन इस खुंदक में सराहना इसलिये नही करते क्यूँकि मैं उनकी सराहना कभी नही करता ...गिव एंड टेक का फेसबुक बाजार इतना सारा लिखने पर भी आज तक मुझे मशहूर नही कर पाया ये इसी पॉलिसी का नतीजा है ...लेकिन इसकी असल वजह मेरा माईग्रेन है ... जो मुझे तल्लीनता से पृथक रखता है और मैं स्क्रीन पर देर तक नही टिकता।।।\n\nजबकि मैं आप सभी को लाईक करता हूँ ...आप सभी मेरी नजर में सराहना के पात्र हैं ...\n\nखैर\n\n\nअसल सराहना होती क्या है ...उस दिन पता चला जब मैं कई दिनों में स्कूल पहुँचा और एक निहायत ही टुच्चे मास्टर ने मेरा जबड़ा हिला दिया ...\n\nउसे लगता था कि मैंने स्कूल अपने बाप का घर समझ लिया है ..लेकिन उस कम्बख़्त को काश कोई समझा देता कि मेरा बाप तो खुद 8 बाई 10 के किराए के एक कमरे में पाँच जमा जानों को लेकर जिंदगी बसर कर रहा है ।।\n\nखैर मुबारकबाद दीजिये मुझे कि मैंने 2000 कमा लिए ... लेकिन जो गंवाए उसका दर्द आज भी बड़ी तखलीफ़ देता है ....\n\n\n\nमेरी जिंदगी की पहली चोरी काश मैं खुद पर अपनी काबिलियत पर खर्च करता और अपने परिवार को फिर खड़ा कर सकता ...वो चोरी एक कोरे अंधविश्वास को नजर थी ...ये उस ढोंगी को देवता मानकर उसके दिखाये सपनों में बहकर मैंने की थी ..जिसने दावा किया था कि वो अपने जंतर से हमारे कारोबार की दशा ठीक कर देगा ...बस उसे तीनहजार रुपये देने होंगे ..फिर वो दो हजार में मान गया - वो आदमी ....\n\nजिसने विश्वास दिलाया था वो प्रेत आत्मा हमारे घर से निकल जायेगी जिसने हमारे घर में कब्जा जमाया है ...\n\nजिसने जमीन पर हाथ पटक कर अपनी हथे\nली के निशान से छापा था कि मेरी वालिदा फिर कभी बीमार नही होंगी ...\n\nजिसने ........\n\nलहू में उबाल आता है ...रोएं कभी माफ नही करते.. कलेजा इत्मिनान नही पाता जब वो पल सोचता हूँ ....\n\nहाँ साहब मैं जुनैद हूँ... जिसे आप अला -फलां न जाने क्या-क्या बोलते हैं ... लेकिन असली कलम का जादुगर वो मेरा रब्ब वो मेरी तकदीर का मालिक मुझे आज जरूर माफ करे कि मैंने उस चोरी को आज सबके सामने जाहिर किया है ...\n\nये चोरी ही मेरे माइग्रेन का प्रबल कारण बनी ..हाँलाकि मेरा ये नजरिया बिल्कुल वैज्ञानिक और तथ्यात्मक नही ...लेकिन जब भी ये माइग्रेन उठता है ...और मुझे अंधा सा कर देता है ..मुझे धराशायी करके ..मुझे ये जताता है कि मैं सिर्फ एक इंसान हूँ..किसी की भी तारीफ मुझे इंसान से ईश्वर नही बना सकती ..\n\nबेशक मैं रोज कलम से अजीब-अजीब से किस्से गढ़ के अपने लिए लाइक बाजार और कमेंट सट्टा उछालता हूँ ....लेकिन जिंदगी इस भेड़चाल से ज्यादा बड़ी और महान है ..कल एक आदरणीया इस बिना पर मुझे फटकार के अन्फ़्रेंड कर गई कि मैं घमंडी हूँ उनकी पोस्ट लाईक नही करता..,\n\nमुझे दुःख हुआ कि उन्होंने मेरे लिए एक गलत नजीरिया विकसित करके मेरा कोटिकरण किया ....\n\nउससे बड़ा कोई झूठा नही जो कहे कि वो लाइक्स और कमेंट्स के लिए नही लिखता ..लेकिन मैंने अनेकों बार इस बात को लिखा है कि आप मेरा आँकलन इससे न करें ....\n\nक्यूँकि मैं एक मामूली सा इंसान हूँ ...जो आज के लिए नही कल के लिए लिखता है ..रोज लिखता हूँ बेशुमार लिखता हूँ ..ताकि आने वाला वक्त जान सके कि मैं भी कहीं स्टैंड करता था ...और मेरा इंसाफ करे और कहे कि एक मजदूर की औलाद जुनैद ने जो लिखा जैसा लिखा पर कभी ऐसा नही लिखा जो इंसान को इंसान से अलग करे ।\n\n\nमैं अक्सर खुद के लिए मौत की दुआ माँगता हूँ..जब माइग्रेन मुझे खुद के बेहद बौने और कमजोर होने का एहसास देता है ...यकीन करें सेलिब्रेटी ऐसा नही करते ..वो विदेश जाते हैं ..डॉक्टर्स की जमात खड़ी करते हैं ...वो खुद को बचाने की आखरी तक जंग लड़ते हैं ....क्यूँकि उन्हें आज से प्यार होता है ..\n\nसेलेब्रिटी बनना अब मेहनत का नही अक्ल का खेल है ...आप अपनी कम्युनिटी को जमा कीजिये . ..अपने मजहब या अपने विचार के लोग जोड़िए और खूब भड़काऊ लेख ..या खिलाफत के लेख लिखिए ...आप का सट्टा सबसे ऊँचा होगा ...आप या तो भीड़ के साथ चलिये या उसके खिलाफ आप अपने उद्देश्य को पा जायेंगे ...\n\nलेकिन मैं हमेशा भीड़ के बहाव के बीच मे खड़ा होकर लिखता हूँ .. और मुझे अपने रौंदे जाने का पूरा अंदेशा है .. मुझे पता है मेरी छोटी सी एकता-भाईचारे और मुहब्बत की ढपली ..उन नक्कारों के शोर में जर्रा भर है ...जो इंसान को सेलेब्रिटी लुक देती है ...\n\n\nलेकिन इनसे परे हटकर ...\nज़िंदगी की एक छोटी सी चोरी मुझे आज तक माइग्रेन बनके चैन से नही जीने देती ..... इसलिए मैं कभी कोई और वजह नही बनने देता कि मैं तड़प-तड़प कर मरूं ...\n\nमैं चैन से कभी नही जी सका ...ये मेरी कहानियाँ अक्सर बता देती हैं ....लेकिन मैं चैन से मरना चाहता हूँ... जब भी मेरी मौत आये ..बाहें खोल कर आये ...\n\n\nमैं इस दुनिया का एक कतरा एक लाइक अपने साथ लेकर नही जाना चाहता ...क्यूँकि मैं फिर एक नई जिंदगी पाने का तलबगार हूँ और उस जिंदगी में ...मैं कभी क़लमकार बनना नही चाहता ...क्यूँकि कलम ही वो बद्दुआ है मेरे लिए जिसने मुझे खुद को खोलने का मौका दिया ...वरना मैं भी आज बन्द होता और अपनी एक अज्ञात और अजनबी जिंदगी जी रहा होता ....'<br />Author:

I see people using SSR's suicide as an ammunition for them to load their guns and fire to spread their agenda. In these people I find my folks to jump in as well.\n\nThey want this issue to remain escalated purely for the reason that young folks will fear from perils of live in relationship.\n\nI simply chimed in that I don't think Live In is bad persey, it can lead to people having safe marriages in future. Since none of the methods arriange or love marriages have proved to be immune from increasing divorce rates. Atleast after couples living in live in relationship will have better confidence going into a wedlock together. They won't have anyone to blame but themselves for anything that happens in future. \n\n\nHow is it a social evil ? If mature, earning and stable adult couples want to live together to ensure better living relationships in future. What's the harm ?\n\nThere are bad instances everywhere. My mother says getting married in the community with good families on both side will ensure no issues arising due to marriage in future. Since both man and woman will feel pressured and socially obligated to follow societal and cultural norms and continue with the marriage to resolve any small or big disputes that arise and not break it off like children. I somewhat agree based on statistics. \n\nBut also disagree that it is the best solution available. There are instances available where arrianged marriages hit the curb nastily. Just yesterday I read a news article where a daughter in laws family is demanding 1.5cr in alimony to break of marriage peacefully or risk fake dowry charges.\n\nWhat are your thoughts ? How come Live in is the new social evil ? 10-15 years back Kissing was one and now I see big ass Movie poster of them. Even saw dudes kissing on big screen.

It could have gone even further, it could have been worse. All these facts, the real truth will come out once the investigation is done by AAIB (Air Accidents Investigating Branch) as under the international civil aviation organisation structure, it has to be an independent body carrying out the investigation. They can find fault with the DGCA too or with airport operator. \n\n**Full Interview: https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-we-know-is-that-the-touchdown-was-late-director-general-of-civil-aviation-arun-kumar/story-DVNngwno2PLjWCLWO46k1M.html**\n\n**Speculations:**\n\nPilots may have tried to take off after understanding the outcome of the situation.\n\n“The wreckage of the cockpit shows the throttle in the fully forward position, which is take-off/go-around position, the spoilers are retracted from the position of the speed brake lever, whereas an aircraft trying to come to a halt after touchdown the spoilers should have been fully extended.” - an aviation source.\n\nsource: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pilots-may-have-tried-to-take-off-after-deep-touchdown-experts/articleshow/77453144.cms\n\nThe flight could have been diverted to an alternate airport as the plane had enough fuel for a diversion.\n\nsource: https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kerala-plane-crash-air-india-express-plane-landed-1-km-beyond-runway-threshold-at-high-speed-2276381\n\n**My Opinion:**\n\n\tLet’s start from the ground, the 2011 survey from DGCA about the airport doesn’t hold up today as ‘most’ of the shortcomings which are being connected with the accident were complied with, as per the DGCA chief.\n\tThat being said, is it possible the ATC could have performed better and recommended the pilots for an alternate destination, given how wet the surface of the runway was? or was such recommendation ignored by the pilots based on their judgements? *If the later is the case, **can a pilot (if there is one on this sub)** give their thought of such decision?*\n\n\tNow let’s talk about the cockpit. From the initial report, it’s clear that the pilots were doing their best to judge the situation, given how bad the weather was for VFR. They clearly, misjudged their landing and made a late touchdown and as such, it seems they even tried for a take off after realising that the plane wasn’t slowing down as it failed to grip the tarmac. However, the instruments in the plane itself are meant to assist the pilots in such situation, is it possible for the computers to malfunction due to faulty sensor and report, let’s say, wrong airspeed reading? \n\n\tOf course the hindsight is always 20-20, looking at it now I can see the accident could’ve been avoided by diverting the flight to another airport if the circumstances allowed. But, nothing can bring the lives lost in that accident. \n\n\nPlease share your thoughts and let me know if you would like me to add more sources.\n\n**TLDR: I’ve shared some sources on the aftermath of crash and given my opinion on what could’ve happened and what could’ve been done to avoid the accident. By no means I’m an expert.**'<br />Author: 'ameyalive'  id: 'i88qp0'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i88qp0/lets_talk_about_air_india_express_flight_1344/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Forgotten lessons from History - The absolute chad Shri KrishnaDevaRaya of the Karnataka Samrajya or the Vijayanagara Empire.'<br />Body: 'We seldom hear about Shri Krishna Deva Raya in our culture, but how much does India know about this great man? At least in Karnataka and I guess in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, we study him to an extent. But what about the rest of the country. Here is an attempt to highlight how great he was. But this is not even the tip of the iceberg. \n\nDuring his reign a portugese traveler named Domingo Paes visits the empire and records in his  *Chronica dos reis de Bisnaga* of the status empire and the emperor himself. \n\nOf the empire he says, "The kingdom has many places on the coast of India, which are seaports with whom we are at peace, and some of them have factories, in particular in *Amcola* (Ankola), *Mirgeo* (Mirjan), *Honor**(*Honnavara), *Batecalla* (Bhatkal), *Mamgalor* (Mangaluru/Mangalore or Kudla)."  Paes reports advanced irrigation technology that allowed the kingdom to produce high yields of crops at very reasonable prices, and a wide variety of cultures. He describes a busy market of precious stones. Of the capital he wrote, "The city was prospering and its size, in the eyes of the narrator, was comparable to Rome, with abundant vegetation, aqueducts and artificial lakes. This is the best provided city in the world. It seems to me as large as Rome and very beautiful to the sight, with broad streets and rows of fine houses. There are groves of trees and gardens. Many aqueducts flow into the middle of the city. "\n\nOf the emperor he wrote, "He is a great ruler and a man of much justice. Every morning he anoints himself with sesame oil, covers his loins with a cloth (probably lungi), and takes in his arms great weights of earthenware; then takes a sword and exercises until he has sweated out the oil. Then he wrestles and gallops until dawn before attending court."\n\nKrishnaDevaRaya was great, no doubt. But his greatness is often relegated to his literary and administrative accomplishments. His military might was second to none. And the battle of Raichur is a prime example of how mighty he was. The neighboring kingdom, Bijapur sultanate of Persian or probably Turkic origin had been a thorn in KrishnaDevaRaya\'s flesh. It had encroached upon the empire\'s territory and had occupied a region called "Raichur Doab". KrishnaDevaraya arrived at Raichur fort with a force that included several hundred thousand infantry and about twenty-five to thirty thousand cavalry including elephants and horses along with a Portuguese contingent. Thousands of courtesans(possibly dancers and concubines) were also taken along with. \n\nKrishnaDevaRaya\'s army laid siege to the Raichur fort. As he didn\'t have the artillery to break the fortifications, he concocted an alternative plan. He sent teams of men with pickaxes and crowbars to take apart the walls. This strategy proved effective as the side swiveling cannons on top of the fort best suited for long range shots were not able to shoot the men below. \n\nThis forced Ismail Adil Shah to cross the Krishna and take on the army directly. He crossed the river with about a 100,000 infantry and 18,000 cavalry and 150 elephants. He crossed the river confidently thinking that he had an upper hand thanks to his superior firepower - about 900 cannons. Irrationally confident and reportedly drunk, he failed to stagger his cannons and fired everything in a single volley. This allowed KrishnaDevaRaya\'s forces to absorb the barrage and respond with a well-timed cavalry charge. His cavalry swept through the vulnerable artillery lines and sent their enemies fleeing into the river. Bodies piled up and the water turned red with blood. The Sultan barely escaped. KrishnaDevaRaya called off his men and returned to Raichur to continue the siege. He now had the enemy cannons in his possession and had a Portuguese contingent of marksmen. These marksmen picked off the defenders one by one until the fort commander decided to poke his head out. A bullet was immediately delivered to his skull and a former surrender soon followed. \n\nIsmail Adil Shah sued for peace, but the chad KrishnaDevaRaya sent a hot-tempered response. The king agreed only on the condition that the Sultan kiss his feet. This insult was so shocking that it had travelled all its way to the courts of Central Asia. Ismail responded that he, could not, as an enemy combatant enter the Empire\'s lands. As if to give Ismail another opportunity to kiss his feet, KrishnaDevaRaya brought his army all the way to Bijapur. But Ismail had fled the city. KrishnaDevaRaya then destroyed Bijapur and left it in ruins. \n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\]  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle\\_of\\_Raichur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Raichur) \n\n\\[2\\]  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo\\_Paes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_Paes) \n\n\\[3\\]  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtvepHA4Pfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtvepHA4Pfo)'<br />Author: 'VN_Doc_RK123'  id: 'i82wcx'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i82wcx/forgotten_lessons_from_history_the_absolute_chad/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'We must all start another parition of India as soon as possible. This is the only way to save our future generation.'<br />Body: "TFR of Hindus has already reached 2.1 in 2015 . That is from 2015 population of Hindus is only going to decrease . \n\nWhile TFR for muslims is higher than 2.6 . Which means their population is going to increase. \n\nAnd in the personal opinion TFR of Hindus will sharply decrease after 2015 . \nAs after 2010 , freedom the Hindu women has got increased exponentially (nothing wrong in it) which will result in Hindu women producing less and less children. \n\nWhile muslims are getting more and more radicalised. And restrictions on women are more or less the same. As the central basis of Islam is subjugation of women. \n\nSo, Hindu population will going to decrease while Muslim population will increase. \n\nPlus there is is illegal immgration from Bangladesh . So, Muslim share in population will increase very sharply from here. \n\nAnd once they have reach 30 percent , Hindu will not be able to do anything. \n\nCurrently we are in the most favourable situation. As because only 3 percent of  all Armed forces are muslims. \n\nThis situation will not remain like this forever.  Once their population reaches 30 percent . They will make reservation for them in all services including Armed forces. \nAnd once they are in the Armed force , matter will be over for Hindus. \n\nCurrently we have BJP govt , Armed forces but situation will not remain like this forever. \nNot after 20 years for sure when BJP will be out of the power forever because of increase in muslim and **christian population** and a new-era of dhimmi govt will begun. \n\nChritian missionaries are working very fast on it. \n\nAlthough christians themselves are not threat to Hindu civilization but they will always align with Islamist forces , we all know.  They will never ever be on the side of Hindus.\n\nSo, time is running out very fast . \n\nWe have a upper hand at present.  Give them Bengal , Kerala , entire JnKnL\nAssam , some area of western UP excluding Mathura, and few more areas contigious to these areas. And get rid of them forever. \n\nSikhs should also be given their own country . Since most Sikhs don't consider themselves Hindus and always play victim card of Delhi riots . Living with crybabies like them is stupidity. \n\nTime is running out as after 20 years power will gone out of the hand of Hindus and after that we will have no choice other than seeing the slow but sure death of out Hindu civilization. \n\nBecause muslims have clear plan of engulfing the whole country and making it Ghazwa-a-Hind.\n\nThis is the only way to treat this disease . \nAny other option like NRC , UCC , whatever is nothing but a painkiller , it will just give you illusion that the disease doesn't exist. \n\n\nTime is running out very fast , if you want to save your future generation then other then partition no solution is there. (Just to add this time there will be full population exchage , i.e in out country only Hindus will have the right to citizenship and no muslims will be allowed . )"<br />Author: 'Dangerous_Head'  id: 'i7r2ti'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i7r2ti/we_must_all_start_another_parition_of_india_as/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bandage and Bondage: State of doctors and medical education'<br />Body: 'The medical students of the government colleges in Uttarakhand had a bond with the state government to serve the state for 3 years (it was 5 years for earlier batches). During the service bond, they would receive a salary which was less than 60% of what was given to the permanent doctors. Needless to say, there was no difference in their work or the working hours (if there is any such thing for them). The state government would get a fresh batch of young and brilliant doctors every year with almost no employer liability (since technically they’re contractual employees) working for them in much-reduced salaries.  \nIn 2019, some bonded doctors filed a case and demanded their salaries be increased to match those of the permanent doctors. Wisdom prevailed and the judgement went in their favour. The government lost its ‘cheap’ labour, and along with this, the ‘reason’ to subsidise medical education. In the following months, the government decided to remove the service bond for the new batches of medical students. This gift came with an 800% hike in their tuition fee - from Rs. 50000 to more than 4 lakhs per year, making the GMCs of Uttarakhand the most expensive in the country. The hostel fee, mess charges and whatnots are separate and amount to more than Rs. 60,000 per year.  \nSeveral states make the medical students sign a service bond as a method of ‘payback’ to the society and they should, especially when there is a dearth of doctors in remote parts. And there is always an option to pay the fee in full and get out of the bond, which makes absolute sense. But in the case of Uttarakhand, the removal of that option along with the subsidy gives a clear indication that the reason for this move was the implementation of a uniform pay structure. I know the economics and necessity of the contractual employment, but letting it affect the education is outright stupid and vengeful to a great extent. It is already an onerous task to serve in villages, especially in the hills. My younger brother, who is also a bonded doctor, has to cross a knee-deep river every day to reach his PHC. Does the government expect a doctor, with a burden of 23+ lakhs, to work in villages at lesser pay, just out of a sheer will to serve the society?  \nThe decision is being challenged by the medical fraternity and we can only wait to see what happens in the days to come. The way with which this matter has been handled by the state government is utterly nonsensical, and while we are celebrating the introduction of the NEP, regressive steps like these will nullify all the good that is expected'<br />Author: 'The_Bhagwan'  id: 'i767bf'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i767bf/bandage_and_bondage_state_of_doctors_and_medical/</li>

We have already [discussed whether pure science is to be pursued](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/htzxtp/indiaspeaks_sunday_debate_a_developing_country/) and how useful it is in the long run. Today we debate a more philosophical issue about epistemology. \n\nThe spirit of enquiry, rationality and objectivity are the bed-rocks of modern science. There are 3 fundamental criteria for scientific knowledge - it should be testable, falsifiable and have the power of prediction. Beyond this, the scientific method must follow inductive and deductive reasoning to follow from what is already known. Thus, science proceeds one step at a time.\n\nHowever, there are several fields where this isn't entirely followed. Most strikingly, in the field of medicine, animal trials followed by [a double-blind study](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-double-blind-study-2795103) is essential for a drug to be approved for human usage. This is an empirical observation of the effects of the drug.\n\nAstrology too, clearly fails these criteria to be considered a science\n\nThen there are fields where the dynamics of this system are so chaotic and unpredictable, like weather prediction. [(chaos theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). \n\nThe motion proposes that due to these short-comings, the inferences from things such as astrology, drug trials and weather prediction do not constitute true scientific knowledge. \n\nSome points [for] the motion - The criteria are clear and objective. Subjectivity cannot be a part of scientific knowledge. It is always better to be completely clear about what has been proved so we don't risk besmirching or diluting the scientific method and all the gains it has brought us. Objective scientific knowledge with rationality as a part of it is the only set of things we can universally agree upon, so we cannot expand this definition\n\nSome points [against] the motion - Ambiguity and uncertainty are a part and parcel of daily life. Even if it is slightly subjective, plausible and not unreasonable jumps in logic are made all the time and if these are excluded from science, then science would remain toothless. A small amount of subjectivity cannot be avoided\n\n*[for] Those who are in support of the motion.*\n\nor\n\n*[Against] Those who are not in support of the motion.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Pick a side - For or Against (Based off the topic/what you want to defend).

Kasturirangan Committee last year(2019). These reports were considered in making of this policy.\nhttps://youtu.be/MrGXkoNHCuw\n\nIt has brought change from Anganwari to School to University.\n\nEarlier there was a 10+2 concept working in the schools. But, now it has been replaced by 5+3+3+4 concept. This has been done by reducing the age of right to get education from 6 years to 3 years.\n\nAs, globally it is considered that a child's 3–6 years of age is very crucial for their mental development . The burden of learning, the very lean concept of rot learning is now been reduced.\n\n\nEach child can take the subjects of their interest and even in college now there will be a concept of major and minor degree.\n\nSay for instance, if a student is pursuing engineering and has a minor interest in Music, then he can study Music in the college and get acknowledged by a minor degree in Music."<br />Author: 'socksch'  id: 'i6f5gl'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i6f5gl/new_education_policy_2020/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Thoughts on the current state of Hindu-Sikh "unity" and hard realities'<br />Body: 'After receiving several messages saying I am a Pakistani agent by one very old user who seems to be a Hindu Indian, I thought I would make a post bringing to light some realities about Hindu-Sikh relations. I harbor no hatred toward the Sikh community nor do I believe they are all traitors. However, the Khalistan movement and Sikh nationalism is more deeply entrenched than some people here would like to believe. \n\nI don\'t believe the guy who sent me those "Paki" messages has bad intentions. I just think he\'s fallen into the delusion of an imagined "dharmic unity" against the "peacefuls," which to be frank, sounds like a modified form of the same pseudo-secularism, just with a different minority. Many of these are Hindus who have not lived in/around Punjab.\n\nSikhs should have ideally have become a kind of warrior Panth within the Hindu fold. We have a shared history of a united struggle against Islamic invaders. Sikh Gurus and later the kukas fought for protection of the cow and Kashmiri Pandits lived peacefully under the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Many Sikhs went to temples, Hindus to gurudwaras, there was intermarriage - in essence, a syncretic Hindu-Sikh culture prevailed in Punjab, and it does to a large extent even today.\n\nHowever, there was also a group of Sikhs who considered themselves separate from Hindus and had a more Abrahamic interpretation of their texts. \n\nDuring British rule, especially in the late 1800s, missionary activity was strong. To counter it, sects like Arya Samaj (Hindus), Singh Sabha (Sikhs) and Aligarh movement (Muslims) rose as a counter. Arya Samaj, though monotheistic in practice, found many followers in Punjab. Bhagat Singh\'s family for example was of Arya Samaji/Sikh background. However, this caused issues with Sikhs whose Gurus Dayanand Saraswati considered foolish and hypocritical. Many Sikhs became Hindus this way, cutting off their *kesh*. The British took advantage of this and propped up the Abrahamicised sect Tat Khalsa (based in Lahore) to take control of the Akal Takht in Amritsar. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tat\\_Khalsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tat_Khalsa) \n\nThese are the people who say they are not Hindus and would later agitate for Khalistan. They control the Gurudwaras. Earlier, the Akal Takht used to have murtis of Hindu Gods, which would be removed roughly a decade after Tat Khalsa Singh Sabha usurped it.\n\nEarlier, Akal Takht was controlled by the Sanatan Singh Sabha, which, true to its name, considered itself one with Hindus:\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan\\_Singh\\_Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan_Singh_Sabha) \n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan\\_Sikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanatan_Sikh) \n\nSanatan Sikhs, unlike Tat Khalsa Sikhs (who are the majority), descended directly from the Gurus. Either way, they are a small minority now and during the Khalistan movement, Bhindranwale hunted them down with more barbarity than he did Hindus. \n\nAmong the groups persecuted by the Tat Khalsa, were Namdhari Sikhs, who to this day, consider themselves Hindu as well as Sikh. The Sikhs depicted in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i5f18d/sikh_elder_on_sanctity_of_ram_mandir_crimes_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) are Namdharis and can be recognised by the white turban. Namdharis, Nirankari Sikhs and Udasis are today not recognised as true Sikhs by the SPGC (the governing body of Sikhs in India). \n\nThe SPGC is ruled by Akali Dal (which is an alliance partner of the BJP). They are nothing but a crypto-Khalistani party who worship Bhindranwale and whitewash his crimes.

      <li>Title::: 'How is repo rate cuts helpful?'<br />Body: "Recently, I've been watching the RBI cut repo rate a lot in order to decrease the interest charged on the loans disbursed by the banks. What I don't understand is this-\n\nRepo rate is just the interest rate charged by the RBI on short term borrowings by the banks against a collateral. So, as short term, the loans are just for max. of 28 days. The purpose is to keep the liquidity maintained in banks so people can withdraw their money if a bank goes out of money. \n\nYes, some banks have fluctuating interest rates on their loans which are linked to the repo rate, but that's something you have to opt for. Otherwise the bank charges its own interest rate based on its cost. \n\nSo, my doubt is, the repo rate is for a maximum period of 28 days, while I don't think that people take loans for such short periods. If RBI wants to decrease the interest rates charged by the banks, shouldn't it decrease the bank rate (the rate at which the RBI lends for a long-term)? Wouldn't decreasing repo rate so much just increase the short term money supply and subsequently the inflation? \n\n(I'm not an economics student so please be elaborative, if possible)"<br />Author: 'randomvariable99'  id: 'i5k45t'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i5k45t/how_is_repo_rate_cuts_helpful/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'How should I fill my gap in studies to do something given the scenario below?'<br />Body: 'Hi members of r/IndiaSpeaks, I will explain straight forward come to the point. I want to spend the next 4 months (Aug-Dec) in a fruitful way. Initallly, I was preparing for a govt post exam very dedicately which got cancelled due to Covid-19 *(you can see my previous posts on this sub that I\'m a pwd person and why I was applying for that lower scale but stable govt job)*. \n\nNow the thing is I don\'t have anything else to do. I will *(hopefully)* join the PhD program in December (wish me luck). Suggest me what to do fill the gap *(I pass out in July 2020, so pretty 6 months gap)* in my studies?\n\nI am from a Tier-1 college in India from CSE branch but could not land in job in any company as I didn\'t do coding but I didn\'t feel bad as I was preparing for govt post which I mentioned above. \n\nI\'m keeping following options (you can suggest other options if you can): \n\n1. Find some internship from internshala (probably non-CS like digital marketing as I think I cannot get CS internship)\n2. Do some ONLINE courses from Coursera/EdX in System admin/IT Support (so that whenever "that cancelled job" reopens up it would give me advantage)\n3. Do some OFFLINE courses in CCNA/Networking from a state-govt sponsored institite (I am not sure about the accrediation of Coursera certificate in govt jobs that\'s why, if you know let me know)\n4. Prepare (learn some coding) and apply to some service-based companies like Wipro/TCS/Infosys till the pandemic is over and govt recruitment scenario reopens. \n5. Don\'t worry about gap in study and keep preparing for govt job/GATE as whenever any job will open, it will have CS syllabus and it will be covered while GATE preparation. \n\n**TLDR: Need suggest to fill my study gap from the above options OR you can suggest any other options.**'<br />Author: 'Present_Positive'  id: 'i5jdcb'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i5jdcb/how_should_i_fill_my_gap_in_studies_to_do/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Ram Temple'<br />Body: 'I see many people on social media opposing Ram Temple. For the record, I support Ram Temple and I understand their reason for opposing. Mostly it is the destruction of Babri Masjid and its aftermath and "Hindutva" politics of BJP.\nBut title case between Ram lalla and masjid is more than a century old ie the legal case doesn\'t owe its birth to destruction of Babri Masjid. (There is no point in discussing ifs &amp; buts of result of Supreme Court case had Babri Masjid stood, since it is alternate history). Fact remains Supreme court decided in favour of Ram Temple.\n\nI also have a question to ask. How many Hindu Temples (older than 200 years) stand in North &amp; North-west India?\nNone. Ain\'t it surprising that the land where Hinduism, a "pagan religion" ie atleast older than Christianity, is primarily practiced has no standing place of worship which we can call ancient? \nWhy? Because Mughals destroyed them. Mughals razed them to ground to erase Hindu history. It is common parlance how Hindus were tortured to convert. Razing their places was a part of that pogrom.\n\nThose who oppose Ram Temple also support Dalit rights because they (Dalits) were oppressed by Upper Castes (i don’t deny any part of it).\nBut shouldn\'t same logic apply to Hindu Temples too?\nIf they could see the hundreds of years of injustice behind "Tilak, Taraju aur Talwar, inko maro jutte char", what is the problem with "Ayodhya to bas jhanki hai, Mathura-kashi baki hai"?'<br />Author: 'algnis'  id: 'i5fzzp'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i5fzzp/the_ram_temple/</li>
