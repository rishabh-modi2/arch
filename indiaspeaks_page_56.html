Adhikari, “we were yet wrapped up in the theory, like the rest of the nationalists, that India was one nation and that the Muslims were just a religious cultural minority.” Many Indian Communists had been “shocked by the formulation that **India was not one nation**,” but the party leadership had it out with dissenters in May 1941." Then, at the historic “Quit India” session of the Congress Working Committee on August 8, 1942, Communist committee members came out against the demand for an immediate British withdrawal and called instead for prior agreement with the Muslim League. The Communist line henceforth urged Congress to concede “what is just and right” in the Pakistan demand.“The rational kernel of the \nPakistan demand,” wrote Adhikari, is that “**wherever people of the Muslim faith living together in a territorial unit form a nationality . . . they certainly have the right to autonomous state existence just like other nationalities in India such as Andhras, Karnatakis, Marathis, and Bengalis.”\'**\n\n\n&gt;It was the Communist line on Pakistan that contributed as much as any other single factor to the ultimate wartime break between the Congress and the Communists. To be sure, the line on Pakistan was only part of the broader “People’s War” line: the Communists were able to use it as a means of camouflaging their opposition to the Congress anti-war stand. But on top of the Communist line-up with the British, the alliance with the Muslim League was, in nationalist eyes, unforgivable. At the “Quit India” session Nehru approved a Communist-inspired pledge that the future Indian constitution “should be a federal one . . . with the residuary powers vesting in the units,” which G. Adhikari boasted “came very near to recognizing the right of self-determination.” But this 1942 “victory” began a controversy with the ofiicial Congress leadership that ultimately resulted in Communist expulsion from the Congress. In December 1945, the Congress Working Committee voted to remove all Communist Party members from Congress office. Nehru drafted a subcommittee report which charged that “without doubt Communist support of the Muslim League’s claim for Pakistan had added to the prevailing estrangement.” “After all,” agreed P. C. Joshi, “the real issue which sharply divides us today is not people’s war, but our advocacy of self-determination.” By the eve of India’s Independence in 1946, Communist leaders were sufficiently aware of sharpening regional consciousness to apply their new line with sweeping abandon to all regions and indeed to the entire future of the Indian Union. \'The Pakistan movement had inspired their “advocacy of self-determination” in the first place, but the prospect of Congress rule in a free India now gave to the separatist line a peculiar new importance, “a source of strength against the day when major national parties would take power at the center In the 1946 election campaign the Communists demanded that power go not to the provisional central government headed by Nehru but to fourteen sovereign regional constituent assemblies, each empowered to decide whether or not to join the new Indian Union. “The delegates to the all-India constituent assemblies should have no more authority than that of plenipotentiaries, wrote P.

This is just my perspective.\n\nI agree the attack by JeM was disastrous and painful. But, do you all really think we need to take revenge on them for this and the PM of India openly saying that we will avenge JeM for the attack. Com'on PM, This is what you teach to us, the youths of India? We are Indians and the thing that sets us apart from others is not where we are from, but the rich heritage we hold and the Dharma we follow. I think everybody knows that forgiving and Non violence is the Param dharm. I am not saying that we should keep quiet, well if we are fighting we shouldn't be fighting for revenge or swarth(own benefit). It should be for the people, we should have some social reason  shouldn't we? Then we will be successful. \n\nHow many of you know, how we got Kashmir? Do you think Kashmir was part of us during Independence in 1947? We kinda forced them to join us by taking advantage of their desperate time by providing help in exchange for their consent to join with India. Again, it's our dharm to help and protect helpless people without asking for anything in return but what did we do?\n\nSecondly, as I mentioned it's okay to fight for people or cause rather than for swarth and revenge. But how many of you know for sure that all the people of Jammu and Kashmir wants to be with India rather than Pakistan? If they unanimously say they want to join with Pakistan why not let them? Do you want rule someone without their consent? Do you think we are different from British, who did the same thing? We are more worse if that was the case. \n\nI would suggest to the PM of India, to conduct an election in JK and see what the results are, make it Public. Then decide actions based on it. Even if 20% of the population wants to be with India. We can make JK as a transit zone without border control, have representatives from two countries to rule it. Or make it a new country.

      <li>Title::: "Addressing India's complacent ineffective foreign policy which will cause an imminent fatal future."<br />Body: '**Why should you care:**\n\nBecause there is a good chance of nuclear attack on India especially if you live in an Indian city. No one\'s talking about about it or foreign policy in media or online. All the Foreign Policy content is heavily get censored or downvoted everywhere including in Indian subreddits. This is a Long post. I will address foreign perception about India and severe inferiority complex Indians possess in another post and why it\'s damaging India\'s development, security and Foreign Policy.\n\n**Why this post:**\n\nYesterday I created a post talking about India\'s foreign policy.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar3b85/why\\_indias\\_foreign\\_policy\\_is\\_misguidedflawed\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar3b85/why_indias_foreign_policy_is_misguidedflawed_and/)\n\nAn excerpt: \n\n**"Talking about stopping cricket, bollywood, visas etc., is stupid. Do you think ISI, pak military generals, JeM, LeT and ISIS give a shit about it?**\n\n**Yes ISIS, that\'s not a typo. ISIS is not regional, it\'s a fucking caliphate like a cancer. Syria-US-Russia conflict coming to an end. Where do you think ISIS focus on next? Yes, waging war against Kashmir and India. JeM is nothing compared to ISIS, even more concerning part US and Russia won\'t be helping India as it doesn\'t fit their interests. india will be alone battling ISIS, Pak, China by itself. So time is not on India\'s side. India\'s Foreign policy should be changed immediately, complacent will cause fatal future for India."**\n\nInstead asking me questions directly Which I\'ve been answering patiently. One user created another post about how my views are embarrassing to new members and asking mods to censor my content. Other users are engaged in trolling. Below is the post refuting the points that user made without referencing me, so I couldn\'t answer them.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar7ca1/i\\_know\\_this\\_tragedy\\_has\\_a\\_lot\\_of\\_people\\_upset\\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar7ca1/i_know_this_tragedy_has_a_lot_of_people_upset_but/)\n\nNow this is not about drama or that I\'m butthurt about this. I genuinely want to share my years of research and views. I would like to engage in respectful discussion and I\'ll try to answer every question regarding India\'s complacent foreign policy which I\'ve been researching for past 20 years because time is not on India\'s side this time. There was never a discussion about India\'s fundamental foreign policy instead of vague bandaid tactics like stopping cricket, bollywood, diplomacy and international condemnations whenever there is a new attack which are outright dumb.\n\n**Why me:**\n\nFirst of all I\'m an NRI, before bash me with "how you hate India", "you think you are better than me because you are nri" and "you care about money than india". While I can\'t reveal any personal information, understand that I had to move because of some circumstances and I still research obsessively about India\'s foreign policy and world\'s foreign policy. I had to create a new account due to nature of my content and for privacy.\n\nInfact decades ago I\'ve prepared for years and passed NDA exam (National Defence Academy) in distinction and waited for months looking for interview letter. After losing my father, I found that my mom hidden the interview letter which I later found about which I still feel the pain about. However I never stopped researching and following passionately about India\'s foreign policy and around the world.\n\nAsk me questions in comments and I\'ll reply, however trolling will be ignored.\n\n**Now my outlook about India\'s foreign policy and refuting the refute post someone made:**\n\nPlease read my original post which was informal. I\'ll try to keep language formal in this post.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar3b85/why\\_indias\\_foreign\\_policy\\_is\\_misguidedflawed\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar3b85/why_indias_foreign_policy_is_misguidedflawed_and/)\n\nNow refuting points made in the post I was targeted in by u/Senigergal:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar7ca1/i\\_know\\_this\\_tragedy\\_has\\_a\\_lot\\_of\\_people\\_upset\\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ar7ca1/i_know_this_tragedy_has_a_lot_of_people_upset_but/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*When 9/11 happened, did US just sent a team to demolish two buildings? US destroyed entire countries in pursuit of that. India should never go to UN to intervene, UN is setup for protecting non-powerful countries and it is really an ineffective solution. Do you think US, Australia, UK or Brazil ask their help if this kinda attack happens on regular basis?*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Apparently since the worlds most powerful military(USA) along with another powerful military (U.K) mowed down third rate non-nuclear countries in the middle east India can do the same thing with ease to pakistan a nuclear armed state sitting next to our border lmao.\n\n**The US 9/11 point is referencing another surgical strike in response to attacks every single time. Not because "they did so we do" argument. The main point is how India relies on UN to solve imminent danger of a neighboring country. Name one country in the world no matter how powerful it is that put up with a 1000 year** [**"Bleed India with 1000 cuts"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleed_India_with_a_Thousand_Cuts) **strategy?** \n\n**The Khalistan movement is fueled by Pak/ISI which resulted in massacres and demise of an Indian Prime minister. The kashmir insurgency is fueled by ISI/pak. Eastern states insugency fueled by Pak and China. There was an attack on Indian Parliament, Kargil war, 26/11 thousands of other examples in just past two decades. Lakhs of Indias were killed in this terrorism. Name one country that endures this. What did India achieve from UN?  I\'ll follow up with Pak\'s nuclear point below.** \n\n&gt;*Arrest all the political leaders who support terrorists, pull off MFN status and divert IWT regarding pak.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here we are another brilliant idea of India scrapping an internationally ratified treaty unilaterly.\n\n**International treaties are not end all and be all. All the countries including India breaks many treaties all the time which at this point serves like a guide. No treaty would survive especially if it\'s unfair no matter how "international" it is. It is a bilateral treaty brokered by World bank. It is not even act of aggression pulling out of that stupid treaty. Read below article about treaty. Let go of notion of India is weak country and can\'t do anything unless it has UN approval or International approval.**\n\n[**https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/sufyan-zia-revocation-indus/**](https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/sufyan-zia-revocation-indus/)\n\n&gt;**Finally, it can be concluded that any such unilateral revocation of IWT by India or Pakistan would amount to breach of the international obligation which may incur state responsibility of that state under international law. Nevertheless, it is equally true that any such act of unilateral revocation of the treaty by India would not amount to the ‘Act of Aggression’ under international law.**\n\n**Congress did a great job hiding IWT and avoid talking about for 60 years. The great Nehruji along with his million blunders (UNSC seat, Gwadar, China war etc.,), he gave away pretty much 95% advantage to Pakistan in Indus Water Treaty. 80% to Pak and 20% to India? In that India\'s 20% dozens of clauses of limitations what India can\'t do? To add insult to injury India paying majority of expenditure? Kashmir assembly crying for years for India to remove this unfair treaty stupid treaty that\'s damaging their agriculture, economy and jobs. What would this result to? More insurgency. The immediate actions should be throw the treaty into the toilet and remove all the special articles regarding Kashmir. Integrate Kashmir into general India.** \n\n**Scrapping treaty doesn\'t mean blocking water, treaty is a piece of paper and a guide. Once you scarp it, you can build infrastructure around without delayed cases in international court. This is not an aggression, Many countries do it all the time and even China has been doing it for decades and they are diverting Brahmaputra to Gobi desert now.  You can ask me questions about IWT, China\'s impact in comments.**\n\n&gt;*India major exports are IT Services and we have crazy trade deficit with China, pull off a mad tariff on china goods trump style bleed china for their arrogance and already tanking economy.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is probably one of most hilarious parts of this post. Now not only does the brainlet who wrote this post not realize that the biggest consumers of India\'s IT services exports is the west(specifically US and UK) but he actually thinks India, a 2.9 trillion dollar economy can crash a 14.3 trillion dollar economy by tariffing them. To put this into perspective china is India\'s largest trading partner while India is China\'s 11th largest trading partner.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is something that USA themselves haven\'t accomplished so far and they are feeling the negative effects of the trade war on their own economy already. Their economy is not collapsing they\'re posting growth at around 6.5%, not much lower than ours.\n\n**I\'ll refute respectfully to your comments even though your language and ignorance is causing me anger.** \n\n**India\'s IT services is not related to China\'s import of IT services, the point is China can\'t hurt India internationally directly or indirectly a non-manufactured, non-physical export. India\'s exports to China is 16.34 billion USD, India\'s imports are 68.06 billion USD. China\'s entire export is related to manufacturing and their entire economy is dependent of exports. I wasn\'t talking about crashing their economy but bleeding. Tariffs work in a way that hurt\'s their economy not immediately but surely.**\n\n**Read below:**\n\n[**China’s Economy Slows Sharply, in Challenge for Xi Jinping**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/china-economy-xi-jinping.html)\n\n**India\'s economy is not dependent on exports. India has internal related economy. The only thing that\'s damaging Indian economy is imports. Oil prices cannot be controlled by India, hence the move for electric and solar energy is much needed where India has perfect geographical location to reap solar energy.** \n\n**China\'s growth is past it\'s peak will be on downfall for another decade, india\'s growth is yet to reach half-point of peak. Don\'t just look numbers and make up your mind.** \n\n**There are many initiatives made by govt for Make in India, investments to make India manufacturing hub. All these lazy businessmen should start focusing on making these goods in India. ironically Indians are bankrolling the terrorism via China. China should be treated as adversary. With their CEPC,** [**String of Pearls,**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_of_Pearls_(Indian_Ocean)) **eastern insurgency, it\'s foolish to be complacent.**\n\n&gt;*What about nuclear weapons Pakistan posses? Develop a strategy, hell just invade the fucking country because of national security and dismantle entire their nuclear power. If Israel can do it against more powerful Iraq at the time, so can India* [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_Opera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yep sabotaging a country\'s attempt to develop a nuclear weapon is the same as attacking a country who has not only developed nukes but has gotten to the point of developing tactical nukes and MIRVs(unconfirmed).\n\n**Pak\'s nuclear programme is one of the worst blunders India and RAW made. Because of the complacent India\'s foreign policy which is exactly what I\'m trying to address here, because of people like you, media and govt used same arguing points how nothing should be done.  Then Indian PM Morarji Desai screwed up whatever minimal efforts by notifying pak about Pak\'s nuclear programme because of the same "peace", "we can\'t do anything", "but what about UN, international" arguments.** \n\n[**https://www.dailyo.in/politics/morarji-desai-kargil-war-pervez-musharraf-pakistan-raw-kahuta-nuclear-warfare/story/1/3802.html**](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/morarji-desai-kargil-war-pervez-musharraf-pakistan-raw-kahuta-nuclear-warfare/story/1/3802.html)\n\n**Past is past. Let\'s focus on the current situation. Cold war nuclear danger was limited by distance between US and russia which now is no longer exists and  it serves as a deterrent at this point. India and Pak\'s situation is different and very dangerous that being ignored.** \n\n**While I cannot share strategies and talk about ways to do it as it is pretty stupid to share these things online. Understand it\'s not very hard to dismantle Pak\'s nuclear strategy by India. Yes it is an act of aggression and war. Do you know what else is act of war? Crossing LoC is. 26/11 is act of war by Pakistan. Surgical strikes by India is act of war crossing LoC no matter how deep into LoC. Pak has no option to acknowledge because then it has to engage with war. What was surprising is that India declaring it to public about crossing LoC and it has been doing it decades in private. No other country has more information about Pak than India and I can say this India knows more about Pak\'s own nuclear programme than Pak itself. There are dozens of ways to do it with minimal casualties and all this information is just sitting there collecting dust because of "international respect" and politics.**\n\n**People underestimate Indian military citing USD budgets or inefficiency. Do not look at the numbers Indian Military strategies are isolated/separated from Political sphere. Do not just look at budget USD numbers. It\'s a complex topic and I\'m not willing to share more information but understand this, in US the monthly bill with 4g data is around $50 which amounts to Rs. 3500. Now do you pay Rs 3500 on your monthly phone bill?**\n\n**I\'ll talk about Pak\'s military strength in the bottom point.**\n\n**Pak\'s N programme is not really under it\'s control. For decades Islamic states around the world treating it as swiss bank to store weapons there. Pak\'s PM is just a puppet it\'s under ISI control at the moment. Not going to talk about sunni-shia topic. But understand ISIS\'s next focus is on India and it already started. US, Russia and any countries won\'t be interested in what happens to India. However I\'m confident we do get the international condemnations we try so hard for. Now ISIS cannot use nuclear weapons because of proximity in Syria/Iraq. However understand that won\'t be the case when it is relocated to subcontinent. India has a very short brief window where it can still thwart pak\'s N weapons efficiently.** \n\n**Every country has a right to defend it\'s own country. Especially when there is a strong evidence that danger is real. People need to let go this notion "India\'s military is not capable, so other countries can do it but not India because of budget numbers". You can ask me more questions about anything including China\'s role. I\'ll answer them however I won\'t be talking about how and ways to do it.**\n\n&gt;*Hell Russia just took crimea one night because they felt like it.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Again another brilliant comparison where a former superpower took a piece of land from a nation state equivalent of an teenager with auto-immune disease.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh to anyone who thinks Russia hasn\'t suffered the consequences of doing that they\'re economy was 2.1 trillion in 2014 by 2017 it was 1.5 trillion. Yeah they got sanctioned to oblivion.\n\n**Do you think India never got sanctioned? What do think happened after India\'s nuclear tests?**\n\n**By your numbers Russia\'s GDP is $1.5 Trillion, do you know India\'s GDP? it\'s 2.95 Trillions. Like I mentioned above, India\'s economy is different, sanctions and "international pressure" are not the reasons India should let crores of people to die being complacent.**\n\n&gt;*Hell just wake up one morning and decide Gilgit-balistan is part of Integral India. UN can go fuck themselves. Disarm and bomb nuclear weapons/reactors and erase LOC and make CEPC and gilgit-balistan part of India. Give ultimatum to China that India previously warned about CEPC, now if it wants to continue trade under India\'s control or GTFO. Modi\'s demonetization style.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*What about China? In that scenario, China cannot fight both India and Japan (if US is included it\'s out of question)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You heard it here folks we will India will invade pakistan, take CPEC hostage while china simply sits there and takes it because Japan for some bizarre reason will go to war with China in support of India despite us having no military alliances.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yes Japan will risk their entire country getting blown to oblivion from hundreds of thousands of missiles from China\'s coast. (which are more then capable covering the entirety of Japan.)\n\n**I\'m not gonna debate your ignorance, but I\'ll talk about the situation briefly.**\n\n**Gilgit-Balistan is part of India which is now under Pakistan\'s control. India had many chances to take back in 1947, 1965, 1971, 1999 wars including 2001 standoff after Parliament\'s attack and 26/11. The great nehruji and other leaders screwed up multiple times with UN plebiscite bullshit. Did you think 2001 Indian military mobilization is made for joy trip to Kashmir? Pak was nuclear state by then, there was real intention to take it back. However unfortunately mobilizing troops took weeks and UN and "International Pressure" cooled down India. For the sake of "being nice" to International communities India withdrew the effort. Enter the magic word "Cold doctrine". Keep aside "what aboutisms", India can take back Gilgit-Balistan, thwart nuclear attempts at the same time.** \n\n**China\'s biggest concern is south china sea not Gilgit Balistan or CEPC.** \n\n[**https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-india-japan-emerge-as-strong-regional-allies-amid-a-rising-china/articleshow/66395211.cms**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-india-japan-emerge-as-strong-regional-allies-amid-a-rising-china/articleshow/66395211.cms)\n\n**In short, China\'s mobilization doesn\'t work because of Himalayas, nuclear attack from China over CEPC or Gilgit is overrated. I\'m tired of typing for this long. However you guys can ask me any questions regarding this. I\'ll try answer to every question apart from trolls.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;'<br />Author: 'KarnaBro'  id: 'arf63x'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/arf63x/addressing_indias_complacent_ineffective_foreign/</li>

Ending terrorism is not just about getting individuals to change, but understanding how our societies and sects uphold extremism in both obvious and subtle ways.\n\nFor how long will we dissociate this religion aspect from terrorism?

We are a soft state in dealing with the insurgency in Kashmir for all practical purposes. Nowhere else in the world are people allowed to throw rocks at army convoys like we see happening in Kashmir all the time. This is a shame on our nation. \n\n\nThe pellet guns that you people keep talking about, they should keep in mind that those are an alternative to the real guns as many other countries have used in similar situations. Instead of writing inane poems, Kashmiris better pray that India does not take lessons in managing permanent local insurgencies from China, US, Russia. Even the tiny Sri Lanka is a lesson in how to deal with such cases. Right now, the Indian position is of magnanimity. J&amp;K gets a really inflated amount of money from the centre, which is not at all in proportion to its population. This money again disproportionately goes into the Kashmir valley, at the expense of Jammu. Even otherwise, India has incurred great strategic costs by releasing 9000 stone-pelters out of sheer goodwill. The last state government there went to the extent of giving money to the stone-pelters\' families. Just think about this, the separatist leadership in Kashmir is a part of India\'s Track-II diplomacy. This is the scale of India\'s magnanimity there. But if the Kashmiri attitude is anything to go by, the \'साम\' and \'दाम\' clearly do not work. If they fail, the natural progression for the Indian state after that is \'दंड\'. Kashmiris are yet to get a taste of that. That\'s when these poems will start making sense.\n\nIn face of such a situation, on a issue of grave territorial and geopolitical significance, Indians who are monkey-balancing on this issue must know that tehy don\'t have the luxury to spout crap like "Pata nahin kaun sahi hai kaun galat". Nobody is a neutral observer in space here. The safety and security of all Indians lies in sovereignty of our country, which is very much tied to holding our ground in places like Kashmir.

Now they don\'t want indians to know about IWT, congress did a great job hiding IWT and avoid talking about for 60 years. The great Nehruji along with his million blunders (UNSC seat, Gwadar, China war etc.,), he gave away pretty much 95% advantage to Pakistan in Indus Water Treaty. The first step is to scrap that stupid IWT and begin constructing Dams and make water usable for Kashmir and India.  But what about China\'s brahmaputra? Well they are pretty much fucked up river-flow to the max. Let go of India being respectful in International society bs and scrap that fucking treaty, design India\'s own treaty. If UN/World Bank makes some objection, cite China\'s dams and prolong the issue for another 300 years. That\'s how UN and international society works. India should kill first, ask questions later.\n\nIndians have this wrong perception about idea of slap to a slap, reaction to an action which is awfully wrong and ineffective. People asking for another surgical strike to the recent attack are irrational.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, did US just sent a team to demolish two buildings? US destroyed entire countries in pursuit of that. India should never go to UN to intervene, UN is setup for protecting non-powerful countries and it is really an ineffective solution. Do you think US, Australia, UK or Brazil ask their help if this kinda attack happens on regular basis?\n\nIndia should get out of the mental perception of treating Pakistan as an equal. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu probably are bigger economies than this rogue country.\n\nArrest all the political leaders who support terrorists, pull off MFN status and divert IWT regarding pak. Repeal all the stupid articles regarding Kashmir and send bajrang dal there. AT least they would used for a good cause instead of this stupid anti-valentine day bulllshit. India major exports are IT Services and we have crazy trade deficit with China, pull off a mad tariff on china goods trump style bleed china for their arrogance and already tanking economy.\n\nWhat about nuclear weapons Pakistan posses? Develop a strategy to neutralize nuclear infrastructure, or just invade the fucking country because of national security and dismantle entire their nuclear power. If Israel can do it against more powerful Iraq at the time, so can India [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera)\n\nRemove fuckin reservations in National security sectors. Why is there reservation system in RAW, Military and intelligence communities? beef up RAW and defense system.\n\nIs there a human right violation happening in Baluchistan? Liberate that fucking part citing saving baluchi\'s lives. Just like 1971 Bangladesh liberation.\n\nHell Russia just took crimea one night because they felt like it.\n\nIndia even can  just wake up one morning and decide Gilgit-balistan is part of Integral India. UN can go fuck themselves. Disarm and bomb nuclear weapons/reactors and erase LOC and make CEPC and gilgit-balistan part of India. Give ultimatum to China that India previously warned about CEPC, now if it wants to continue trade under India\'s control or GTFO. Modi\'s demonetization style.\n\nWhat about China? In that scenario, China cannot fight both India and Japan (if US is included it\'s out of question).\n\nSay what you want about Indira, but during 1971, even when India is under crippling poverty and no other country is a friend to India. She pulled off a war on both fronts and liberated Bangladesh. If she can do then, So can Modi now.\n\nThe Kashmir Issue is only because of Indus water and nothing else.

This is to allow users to participate when they are free due to the time zones as India is 3.5 hours ahead of Finland\n\nThe purpose of this event is to allow people from two different nations to get and share knowledge about their respective cultures, daily life, history and curiosities.\n\nFinns ask their questions here and for us to answer while Indians ask their questions in r/Suomi to be answered by Finnish users [HERE]. Sounds good?\n\nGeneral rules of Reddit and the respective subreddits apply on both sides and any troll/hate/edgy/hostile comments won't be tolerated. Please be respectful of one another. Remember to have civil discussions and no drama please.\n\nI hope the exchange turns out eventful and would like to see active participation and engaging discussions during the cultural exchange from both sides. \n\n\nIn light of the recent events, I understand it may not be the best of time to have this cultural exchange but it's best we honor what we had planned. We are going through a tumultuous time and understand that everyone's blood is boiling but please remember to remain civil and participate in goodwill. I would like to thank the mods of r/Suomi for giving us the privilege to host their subreddit.\n\nTo get you started here's some cool facts about Finland!\n\n**The Finns sure love their coffee!**\n\nThe average Finn consumes 12 kg of the brown stuff every year. It’s impossible to put a specific figure on how many cups of coffee the average Finn will drink in a day, but we’d wager that it’s more than your doctor (if not a native Finn or fellow caffeine freak) would recommend.\nThe Finnish coffee culture may stem from varying influences such as Lutheran work ethic, Swedish rule, and several prohibitions on coffee, but one thing is for sure: coffee isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. If you are ever invited to a Finnish home prepare to be met with hot pots of coffee - just don’t ask for decaf, it's virtually non-existent in this Nordic country.\n\n\n**The Finnish language is not similar to other Scandinavian languages**\nDanish, Norwegian and Swedish are quite similar and when making a small effort it’s not hard to understand the 3 of those languages, even though they are not exactly the same.\nFinnish however, is something completely else. The Finnish language is part of the Finno-Ugric language group and is way more similar to Estonian than the Scandinavian languages, even though it neighbours the Scandinavian countries.\nIt’s not even an Indo-European language, it belongs to the Uralic language family, which makes it quite unique and cool since most European languages are a part of the Indo-European language tree!\n\n**Nokia originated from Finland** \nToday, well known for its phones, Nokia orginally started off as a paper production company in 1865 in Finland. The company was established by mining engineer Fredrik Idestam on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia. This mill was then transformed into a share company, in 1871 by Idestam, with the help of his close friend Leo Mechelin. They renamed it the Nokia Company.\nThe name 'Nokia' is derived from the river Nokianvirta, on the banks of which the company was established. Nokianvirta itself was named after an old Finnish word, which originally meant sable.\nBefore moving their business into electronics in 1960, Nokia Company expanded to working with rubber, electricity, and cables. Nokia rubber boots become a bona fide design classic, still on sale to this day – though the company no longer makes them.\n\n\n**Fast facts**\n\nYou can ring in the New Year twice by hopping the border between Finland and Sweden as there is a 60 minute time difference between the countries.\n\nThe Finns coined the name “Molotov Cocktail” to describe the fire bombs they used in fending off the Soviet Union (specifically the Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov) during World War II. The bombs are thought to have originated from the Spanish Civil War and were adopted as a means to fight tanks.\n\nJRR Tolkien based the High Elvish language in Lord of the Rings on Finnish due to the inspiration he found in a national myth story of Finland, The Kalevala.\nIf you are visiting a Finnish friend in their home country for the first time, remember to remove your footwear outside their home.\n"<br />Author: 'Scype_crisis'  id: 'aqwdmz'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aqwdmz/hei_rsuomi_our_cultural_exchange_is_now_live/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why the concept of "westernisation" as the civilisational end goal is misplaced.'<br />Body: 'I am currently reading up about Peter the Great’s reforms, and it struck me that the mostly western and few Russian historians (as well as his contemporaries) constantly harp on how “This was a great leap towards modern European thought”, that he left behind the “dark past of the Asian side of Russia”, “westernisation and joining the comity of advanced nations” and it made me think…compared to our contemporaries from almost 500 AD – 1,700ish AD, European nations were far behind India (and China) when it came to running a very advanced administrative apparatus, extracting tax, maintaining large bureaucracies, a large standing army (the standing armies and navies in India were like 100 times larger than what you saw in Europe after the fall of Rome and till the 1700’s) and basically the system of running a large, diverse and prosperous state. This is how pervasive “eurocentrism” is. Westernisation is taken for granted as the ideal end point and projected as something superior to anything the rest of the world can come up with, but this is not even remotely the truth. The issue is this is now so deeply in our systems (China thankfully is not poisoned by these thoughts as much as we are, thanks to Nehruvian era obsession with the west and adapting everything from the west) that we think us backward and Westernisation the end goal. Our native systems were far superior to that of the west, and this is for almost 80% of the time we have been in existence as cvilisational entities. While the end goal is nebulous, we need to forge our own systems again, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel, but blindly adapting what the West does is stupidity.\n\nLook at Peter’s reforms (no way is this a diss on Peter or Russia), the epitome of march towards westernisation and you will see that Indian (and Chinese) systems were far far far superior to anything Western Europe had then and for a 1,000 years prior to that. In fact these reforms should be called idk the march towards Indoisation or Sinoisation or whatever as they are more representative of the truth. In fact the West was itself slowly matching the systems found in India and China in this period and this Indoisation should be the end goal in that era (this is tongue in cheek, so take it in the spirit this para is written).\n\n Administrative Reform – Russia till Peter the Great was broadly divided into regions called Uyezds loosely translated into districts, but nothing more. This was mostly for extracting tax revenues and not for administration. Peter’s reform was to give this much greater structure and depth. He created 8 governorates and then deputed some 10 bureaucrats to govern these regions.\n\nThis is considered a major step towards “Westernisation”, yet ancient India, right from the time of the Mauryans has had very clear administrative governorates, a large pool (not just some 20 per district) of bureaucrats of professional bureaucrats at various levels. Look at the Cholas for instance, right from the time of the early Cholas, broadly the Chola empire was divided into “Mandalams” (States). Each Mandalam was sub divided into Kottams (think districts) then further divided into Nadus (think taluks) and finally Oorus (village level). Each of these divisions had a nominated bureaucrat in charge, running affairs. He was assisted by central govt (from the Chola court) babus who ran tax affairs and a sort of a judge who oversaw justice delivery. Local administration including justice was itself was further devolved onto village councils (look up Uttaramerur inscriptions if you want to be blown away by the granularity of how these councils ran). Just some highlights,\n\nThe Nadu level had a representative assembly voted by the regional chieftains, and appointed a head called Nattiar. The Nattiar represented the Nadu in the Central court. The village level was similarly governed by a Gramam Nadu (a locally elected body). Now similar to what Gandhi envisioned, this was the key administrative unit. It rendered justice, collected taxes, built and maintained water tanks, roads, bridges etc, maintained law and order and were from what we know of this structure actually an elected body with term limits and a right to recall (something most democracies don’t have to this day). The village administration itself was outsourced to many shrenis (guilds). So Shreni A might idk accept responsibilities for a certain patch of roads, another might arm the local milita, yet another might supply the manpower…..this is like the private sector doing CSR?\n\nThe later empires, Vijayanagar, Mughals all had equivalent or superior (Vijayanagara) administrative systems. These were according to K A N Sastry though, far more centralised (out of scope of this discussion) and that the brilliant system of local governance built up in Tamilakam for a 1,000 years fell apart after the Muslim invasions.\n\nAfter the wall of Western Rome, Western Europe (the alleged westernisation bit of Peter’s reforms) lacked such advanced governance systems for nearly a thousand years. Not saying they didn’t have one, just that it paled in comparison to what the ancient and medieval Indians had and Chinese system was even more advanced than the Indian system and light years ahead of the European systems.\n\nTax Reform – Peter the Great basically revolutionised Tax collections with his introduction of a poll tax (tax per household, which is what most European states followed). India had for 1,000’s of years a far superior way of tax administration. Again, take the Chola system. The Emperor ordered regular surveys of lands, lands were classified into Productive, less productive and non productive land. Then land titles were determined and taxes were fixed at roughly 15% of the total yield per plot. In addition to this, Shrenis had to pay taxes to operate (Professional tax). You had a Tax revenue department (puravuvaritinaikkalam) that assessed the yields and then decided duties and taxes. A department of land (don’t know how to translate this though) updated boundaries for established properties, farms, temples, houses and royal land. This information was shared with the tax department for them to collect taxes accordingly. \n\nThis was not just some vague department, you had defined roles filled by a central bureaucracy,\n\n* Kurusegayar – Land Classification Supervisor,\n* Veli Nayakan – Supervisor for fertile lands,\n* Nadu Vegai Seiyar – Officer in charge for determining fertility levels of lands,\n\n\nJust the land tax department had 8 defined roles and officers in charge of them running large teams of bureaucrats. Later empires like Vijayanagara replaced the bottom up approach with a massive (like 1,000’s strong) team of tax officials from the capital, based out of the regional capitals, but the system was no less sophisticated. \n\nAgain, nothing, not even a single civilizational entity in all of Western Europe even came remotely close to such a sophisticated tax bureaucracy for a 1,000 years and yet Peter’s efforts are called “modernisation and westernisation”?\n\nAnother reform of Peter that was considered a step towards modern Westernisation was the establishment of a kings governing council….again, this was the norm in Indian empires since the time of the Mauryans at least. This was though not entirely absent in Europe since the fall of Rome, but again, not even close in sophistication or process.\n\nThe point is, what Eurocentric historians, including our own Marxist hagiographers in India consider modernisation, Ancient India got there centuries before the West. The past 200 years area an aberration and we should slowly forge our own civilisational entity again'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'aqgdpt'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aqgdpt/why_the_concept_of_westernisation_as_the/</li>

All days are exact same and getting longer and longer at work. What is something that i can focus on which me help me from going nuts and help me build a great career.  I was thinking of programming but  I think it's already too late for me.  \nWhat skill should build up to get a good start on freelancer?\n\nFYI, my grad. background is engineering in ECE  but I doubt it will be of any significance."<br />Author: 'war_hog'  id: 'aq9fac'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aq9fac/need_advice_on_career/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'THE LEGACY THAT IS NOT OUR OWN'<br />Body: 'India got independence in 1947. When the freedom fighters were sacrificing their lives to gift us the sweet air of freedom, were they aware that we would adapt their language and treat it as our own? We were colonised by the British for over 200 years and we are yet to overcome the colonial hangover. English is treated superior than other languages. If an individual can’t speak in English, he is considered inferior. As funny as it may sound, people tend to analyse intellect through one’s fluency in English. In India, not knowing Hindi is fine, but not knowing English may cause serious troubles. Hindi is only taught till eighth grade in schools and becomes optional after that but English is compulsory till twelfth grade. Not only that, job providers seek people with fluent English. It is factually correct that most students from Hindi Medium schools have greater potential than students from English Medium. So maybe, it is now time to think whether or not English is worth giving the importance that it has.\nChina has the world’s second largest economy and they didn’t use English to build their empire. Mandarin is their official language. Just like India, there are several other languages that are spoken in China but the official language is still their own. France was also colonised by the British but only 39% of the French population can speak decent English and their official and national language is French. Is it just us Indians who adapted the culture of the ones who betrayed, tortured and ruled us? The British didn’t just rob us of our economy but also of our identity.\nBeing multi-linguistic is a good thing. Knowing how to speak in English is not wrong. But we should treat it like we treat other languages. English is a mere language just like Hindi, French, Spanish. English is a global language, yes. But we need to be strong in order to be developed. And that can only be when we get comfortable with who we are. We are Indians. We were once ruled by the British but that doesn’t have to become our identity. Unifying the country would be much easier if we use our own language because most of us already know it. We can still change things and empower ourselves as who we are rather than using the identity given to us by the British. The hypocrisy of this article is that in order to reach the masses, it had to be written in English.'<br />Author: 'DecentCover44'  id: 'apt798'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/apt798/the_legacy_that_is_not_our_own/</li>
      <li>Title::: "My observations on India: India won't succeed nor will it fulfill her potential"<br />Body: 'You guys bicker too much, the culture isn\'t there and there is a severe lack of morality. Maybe it\'s me being melodramatic but when I see "gang rapes" and the Rafale case. It really is disgusting and disheartening.\n\nWith regards to the Rafale case, the lies, the fucking lies! The fucking ignorance and bullshit is disgusting. Everyone thinks they\'re a fucking defence expert without any sense of rationality whatso-fucking-ever. \n\nRead this - \n\n&gt; Congress President Rahul Gandhi: CAG report is a worthless report. I would term it as a ‘Chowkidar Auditor General Report’. It is Narendra Modi’s report, written for the Chowkidar, on behalf of the Chowkidar, for the Chowkidar by the Chowkida\n\nAnd this about the PM -\n\n&gt;  “Is he talking about himself? Now he is both chowkidaar and chor? Is it schizophrenia?”\n\nWhat the fuck..? What the actual-fucking-fuck? Don\'t get me wrong, the BJP/Modi have said some seriously dodgy stuff but this above guy is a real buffoon and has been repeatedly lying about the case. \n\nAnd the media? Twisting stories, lying repeatedly, with the intent of trying to push out the Govt due to their hatred. Disgusting. Feeding people absolute horseshit and typical Indians are fucking eating it up. Today was a story about an MoU which had fucking nothing to do with the Rafale and was with regards to a Reliance partnership as well as looking to purchase Airbus helicopters. Fucking helicopters! Read -\n\n&gt; At a press conference today, Rahul Gandhi passed off a mail on Airbus helicopter deal—which Anil Ambani never got (he was rejected, Mahindra was picked)—as the Rafale deal and no one, I mean not one journalist questioned him. Astounded\n\nhttps://twitter.com/eeta/status/1095287675748155393\n\nSeriously? Fucking what? Is this how low India has fucking sunk? \n\nThe media hitjobs are fucking digusting. They want NDA out and they\'ll stoop so low as to hurt India\'s national interests. Do you see any headline articles/headline pieces that have sought to REFUTE the baseless allegations? \n\nJust fucking lies all around. Lies! Lies! And lies! \n\nAnd what\'s all worse? Someone from the MoD is actually leaking official documents with the purpose of maligning the Govt and whilst providing no context whatsoever. What the fuck? Why did that greedy prick not think about the damage it\'d do to the MoD and India\'s defence interests? \n\nEven NDA, why the fuck did they not grab a hold of their MLAs spouting absolute garbage? So much shit has been spouted by them that has hurt them. Once in a generation mandate and didn\'t even reform labour/land in a major way. Demonetisation, looking back, has now proven to be a disastrous mistake and their defence of the Rafale deal has been so fucking weak that they\'ve allowed Congress to push their narrative. Fucking state of it. \n\nMy observations? India won\'t succeed and reach its potential. Too much greed, too much political toxicity, too much stupidity, a lack of rationality and objectivity, political parties not giving a damn about the country but caring about themselves and caring about power. No foresight. This doesn\'t even take into account matters like bureaucracy, climate change, burgeoning population, communal tensions etc. \n\nYa know, the funny thing is is that I was massive optimist for India, massive idealist and I\'d always hear Uncles say "India will never change", "the politicians are too dirty, the country will never succeed" and always used to refute them and thought that they hated India. But now I realise that the quote "Inside every cynical person is a disappointed idealist." was never more true.

WHY GOD? WHY HIM?\\*\n\nI run a transit camp. My residence &amp; the transit camp officer's mess are barely  five feet apart. Nevertheless, I always make it a point to dress up &amp; visit the  mess for all three meals, daily. I never order food into my room. In fact I  never order food into my room anywhere, even in a hotel. The reasons are many. \n\nFirstly, its a strain on the staff to serve me in my room. Secondly, its almost  obscene to have unwashed crockery &amp; utensils lying in one's room as you retire  for the day. Thirdly, the smell of the used crockery, utensils &amp; leftover food  tends to seep into every nook, cranny, furniture, linen &amp; clothing in the room. But the principal reason I go to the mess is to meet people. You see, my outfit  is a transit unit &amp; as such I receive a new lot of people, officers, JCOs, OR &amp; even some civilians in my unit almost everyday. \n\nI run the first stage  acclimatisation camp. I probably have more officers and men on any given day,  than any Inf battalion or Arty regiment. They all spend 8 - 10 days on an  average acclimatising with us before leaving for their tough assignments in  super-high altitudes. Occasionally, when the weather is bad or when the lines of communication are disrupted, these people spend more days with us. So, apart  from my routine rounds of the camp, I make it a point to be there at the mess to interact with these officers. This is their first stage of induction into the  high altitude area &amp; I feel obligated to meet &amp; greet them and learn from them. \n\nI am fortunate to the extent that I get a fairly eclectic mix of officers at the camp. Nearing middle age in life &amp; old age in service, I consciously avoid  sliding into rambling reminiscences and hemming &amp; hawing about my days etc that  will not only bore the officers but also waste their precious time. So I try to  keep the conversation on the table brief and limited to the time taken to  consume the pudding &amp; be served the after mint. Still, you get to talk a lot  during these interludes. \n\nBut this is not a story of my mess going habits. It is sadly an obituary. You  see, most officers I notice want to just get done with their meals and get back  to their rooms and their mobiles and laptops. They do not want to interact in  the mess. Many sit in far off tables &amp; seldom make the effort to come &amp; join you for the meal at your table if it is empty. I suppose the fact that liquor is  banned at this location is one of the reasons for this lacklustre motivation to  interact. It is curious for the government does authorise us all Rum &amp; Cigarette Allowance at this location.  But then orders are orders. \n\nThere are however a few officers who like to spend time with the people around,  interact with them &amp; allow for reciprocal learning from each other's  experiences. One such officer was Maj Nisheet Dogra, newly posted to take over  an Independent Armoured Squadron in High Altitude Area. He came in here on 19  Jan 19, from the Western Sector, as usual for the regular acclimatisation. He was different, I noticed. He interacted with people around and tried to imbibe from them. \n\nHe was placed on reserve for the upcoming Junior Command Course that  he felt he may have to attend. So he came over to me on 26 Jan 19, asking me to teach him about the employment of Artillery and other professional subjects. We spent hours in my room discussing the mechanics of Fire Planning and the art of  writing a tactical appreciation over mugs of black coffee. He was an intent  listener and a conscientious learner. Apart from tactics and other professional  subjects, he would discuss with me as to how he can develop the infrastructure  and facilities for his squadron, that was newly inducting from the plains to  take over its role in a High Altitude Area. \n\nHe spent about 15 days here, stuck  as he was along with many other officers because of heavy snow that precluded  movement along the road going upto his location and beyond. In all these days, I noticed that he continued to learn from people around and spent time studying in his room. He was generally concerned that his handing/ taking over period was being depleted by the weather that was preventing his move to the designated  location to take over from the existing squadron that was scheduled to move out  shortly.\n\nHe left this place on 31 Jan 19 to the next stage acclimatisation. He reached  his sub-unit location I presume on 05 Feb 19 after the four days second stage  acclimatisation at the next transit camp. I hear that he even continued to  interact with the CO of the next transit camp on similar lines. Considering the  usual four day handing/ taking over period for appointments, I presume that he  would have taken over the same on 09 Feb 19.\n\nIt snowed heavily yesterday in this sector especially in the higher reaches  where it touched close to 6 - 8 feet. At about 1500 - 1530hrs on 09 Feb 19, a  large and heavy mass of snow slid down the mountainside &amp; struck the temporary  'Chakda' shelter of Maj Nisheet Dogra. The mass of snow broke in from one end of the shelter, flushing everything inside including the officer who was probably  resting in his bed along with his belongings &amp; furniture from the other side. \n\nThe officer was probably hit badly on his head by some blunt object even as he  was washed out of his shelter and buried 3 - 4 feet under the snow, with his  belongings and furniture scattered over a 50 - 70m distance. Nobody had noticed  the same. At about 1600 - 1630hr, I believe some other officer was trying to  contact him on the telephone and when he got no response he sent someone to look him up. The people could not find the officer &amp; soon having realised that he may be buried under the snow, the unit was assembled and they started digging &amp;  pulled him out from under about 20 - 30m away from his shelter at about 2200hrs  (nearly 5 - 6hrs later). \n\nI am told his body was frozen stiff &amp; he had a severe  gash on his head, but he probably had some weak pulse. He could not be evacuated because the roads were not cleared for move due to snow and the night flying ALH couldn't make it, for whatever reason. In any case he was in a bad shape and was declared dead at around midnight. \n\nThree Cheetahs of the Army and One Cheetah and one Chetak of the IAF came here  in the morning and couldn't pick up the body from the place purportedly due to  snow, although they were equipped with skis. Finally, the troops moved the body  to another helipad five km away in a tank (a tank mind you) from where a Mi – 17 finally evacuated his body at around 1530hrs (24hrs after the tragedy).\n\nThe above incident brings to light so many points to ponder. We are talking  about a two and half front war, but we are unable to open up a road to even one  front. Imagine, it took 24hrs to evacuate a body. I really do not know why a  night evacuation was not attempted, but we have received assurances from higher  HQ that when required ALH will be used for night evacuation. However, I cannot  fathom how the pilots can suddenly one fine day take off on a critical night  mission, if they have not practiced the same during normal periods. I have never seen an ALH arrive in this area by night or even dusk. I am sure they are  capable, but you have to rigorously practice these things during peace if you  have to execute such missions in war or during a crisis. \n\nIf you cannot take risk in peace, do you really think you can summon the courage and the ability to take one during war and execute it effectively.  The next aspect is the roads in these areas. Even after so many years we do not  have proper roads to support our troops. Imagine, they could not evacuate a  casualty because the road is full of snow. We do not have snow clearing  machines. In any case, these machines only function well when the roads are  smooth tarmac. How can you clear a road that is full of boulders and rocks. A body was transported by a tank. The GREF dozers that are ordinarily used for  these purposes are not functional most of the time. \n\nThen comes our habitat. A 'Chakda' shelter is nothing but a semi-circular tin sheet with improvised entry/ exit on either sides. Its uncomfortable to live &amp;  inefficient to heat and yet we house our troops in these at high altitudes where temperatures touch -25 to -40 degrees celsius. We do not plan the layout of our habitat well and let things develop in an ad hoc &amp; haphazard manner with no  siting keeping terrain, weather and geographic considerations. \n\nWe are like those idiots in Hawai, who built a settlement next to an active volcano and were then  wondering why there's lava in their living room. Our utilities are so poorly  planned that we cannot supply water to these troops in pipelines that do not  freeze in the severe winters. Electricity is either non-existent or through  generators and the installations are so poorly done that there is always the  danger of short circuit, electrocution or fire. \n\nAnd yet war game after war game after war game after war game, we keep hemming &amp; hawing about defeating this or that enemy. We want to create IBGs to make  vacancies for higher ranks, but we cannot plan a simple settlement of troops  that is safe from essential elements, forget the enemy. \n\nIt is about time we got ourselves to plan well, train well &amp; execute well. We  are doing none of the above. We are day by day becoming a scared and indifferent army. We are passing orders that absolve us of potential crisis and consequently and have over the years made our personnel (officers, JCOs &amp; OR) incapable of  performing in a crisis. We are just managing the aftermath of a crisis and  congratulating ourselves of getting through the day. This is true of all arms  and services and all cadres. \n\nNisheet Dogra's death was tragic, untimely &amp; I feel highly avoidable. The young  man had dreams that he shall never realise now. He is survived by a wife whom he had married not a year ago. \n\nLastly, I carry a a mixed bag of remorse and requital in my mind. Remorse that  Nisheet died so young for nothing and requital that my lessons were probably the last items in his dreams of a good soldiering career, when the mountain claimed  him. I feel that my regular visits to the mess allowed me to meet this truly  energetic young man who was not aloof, indifferent or self engrossed but was  bubbling with enthusiasm and zest for life and willing to interact with people  and learn, and while his face and smile still haunt me I am also thankful for  that for otherwise he would have been just another faceless casualty among many that our army suffers for nothing. \n\nThe only eternal question is Why Him God? Why Him! Rest In Peace you grateful  departed soul. There are no more fire plans or appreciations to bother you.

Did your favourite singer win a Grammy? Did your favourite sport just have a major event? Is Kim Jong-Un still around? Discussion topics do not have to be related to India - yes, we too can comment on countries that we barely know anything about! Here are a few items to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n[1. Pak close to securing IMF deal](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pakistan-very-close-to-securing-imf-bailout-finance-minister-1991790)\n\nDespite money from allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and possibly also from China, Pakistan is still going to the IMF for a bailout package that, as PM Khan said, will include some tough reform measures. Pak is asking for a loan as forex reserves stand at $8 billion (less than 2 months of imports) and growth is slowing. Bond rating companies have further downgraded Pakistani bonds on fears that the country will be unable to repay its massive debt. In addition, local banks that deal heavily in government debt have also been recently downgraded, making it harder for them to get credit from the international market.\n\n[2. Iran marks 40th anniversary of Islamic Revolution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/11/th-anniversary-iranian-revolution-rouhani-says-country-will-not-give-up-military-power/?utm_term=.11c75e6e833d)\n\nIn 1979, Ayatollah  Khomeini  led a revolution in Iran that toppled the Western-backed Shah\'s regime and established the Islamic Republic. Iran marked the 40th anniversary of that event with a series of events, including a national speed by the President Rouhani, whose authority is subordinate to that of the Ayatollah, where he vowed to build Iran\'s military capabilities in the face of a American opposition and sanctions that have crippled the economy. The head of the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (which is a US-designated terrorist organization) also vowed to continue Iran\'s military interventions across the region, saying "We will help any Muslim anywhere in the world."\n\n[3. Thai princess barred from contesting upcoming elections](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2019/02/11/thai-election-commission-to-rule-on-princess-running-for-pm-after-kings-rebuke/)\n\nIn a surprising turn of events last week, the sister of the Thai king, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi, filed her papers to content in the upcoming national elections, the first to be held since a military coup ousted the previous civilian administration in 2014. And to make matters worse, she filed her nomination with the Thai Raksa Chart party, which supports the former ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Now, the country\'s election commission has rejected her nomination, ostensibly to keep the royal family above politics. What\'s more, the party could face a ban for breaking a law that requires politicians to avoid using the monarchy for political issues. A ban on the party could give more power to the military-backed government that is looking to win the election. The military already nominates one-third of legislators as per a new Constitution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top stories from the world:\n\n[1. Russia plans new missiles after both sides withdraw from INF Treaty](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47134028)\n\nAfter the US pulled out of the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, Russia did the same and has now vowed to developed new intermediate-range nuclear missiles (500-5,500 km range). The treaty was originally signed to prevent nuclear annihilation of Europe by Soviet nuclear weapons, but the US has accused Russia of violating the treaty in the last few years. However, many commentators believe that the real reason the US withdrew from the treaty is so that it could develop new missiles to target China\'s eastern seaboard from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Guam. China is not part of the treaty and already has intermediate-range nuclear missiles, and the Trump administration has previously said that it would want a new treaty to include China.\n\n[2. Venezuela\'s military blocks road to prevent aid from entering country](https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuela-military-sets-up-blockade-on-bridge-to-stop-aid-from-colombia)\n\nVenezuela plunged deeper into crisis as the military, which officially backs President Maduro, blocked a major bridge into neighbouring Colombia to prevent a shipment of aid from entering the country. He was condemned by opposition leader and presidential claimant, Juan Guaido, who wants to use the aid to undermine Maduro and force him to leave office. Most neighbouring countries, European countries, and the US recognize Guaido as the interim president pending free elections. Maduro, on his part, claims that there is no humanitarian crisis in the country and that the aid is akin to a US military invasion.  "We are not beggars," Maduro said.\n\n[3. \'Miss Curvy Uganda\' sparks outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/07/outrage-over-miss-curvy-beauty-pageant-to-promote-ugandan-tourism)\n\nLike every country, Uganda wants to promote tourism. However, a private initiative backed by the country\'s tourism minister has sparked an outrage. \'Miss Curvy Uganda\' is a planned beauty pageant for "plus sized women" to encourage tourists to come and see Uganda\'s beautiful women. This is part of the tourism ministry\'s plan to add \'curvy and sexy women\' to official literature as one of the many attractions in the country. However, women\'s right activists and the country\'s ethics minister have condemned it, stating that it objectifies women and normalized sexual violence. Calls for cancelling the event and firing the tourism minister continue to grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Suez Crisis\n\n*(A new feature to educate the sub on critical people and events that shaped history)*\n\nIn 1956, Egyptian President Nasser (one of the co-founders of the Non-Aligned Movement along with Nehru, Tito, and Sukarno) nationalized the Suez Canal, setting off a crisis with France and Britain that wanted to retain control over it, as well as Israel, which Egypt was blockading since it was founded. In October 1956, Israel, France, and Britain invaded Egypt. Aside from ensuring continuing shipments of oil, the British had an additional reason to fight: to continue to have speedy access to its colonies East of Suez, even though its largest and most important colony there (India) had achieved independence. The French blamed Nasser\'s Arab nationalism for stoking an independence movement in Algeria, while Israel wanted to strengthen its position on its southern border and gain shipping access via the Straits of Tiran in the Red Sea.\n\nThe invasion was a quick military victory for the British, French, and Israeli forces, but not before Egyptian forces damaged the canal and prevented its further use. However, it was a diplomatic disaster for those countries. US President Eisenhower condemned the attack on the grounds that he could not condemn the ongoing Soviet invasion of Hungary while being seen to accept the invasion of Egypt. He also threatened to sell millions of pounds of British bonds to undermine their economy. The Soviet Union also condemned the invasion as it was trying to gain favour of the Muslim world (indeed, hundreds of thousands protested against the invasion in Lahore). At the UN, the General Assembly passed a resolution against the invasion and established the UN Emergency Force (UNEF) to bring a stop to the fighting, the first peacekeeping force established by the UN. Saudi Arabia also started an oil embargo against Britain and France (it never traded with Israel anyway).\n\nIn the end, Egypt won the war, with the UN, US, and USSR recognizing its sovereignty over the Suez Canal. Israel gained marginally as it restored trade through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt had closed since 1950; it also saw a period of peace with Egypt as the UN force stopped fighting in the Sinai. For Britain (and to a lesser extent France), it marked the end of its global empire as it was humiliated and forced to withdraw. In subsequent years, all remaining large colonies East of Suez gained independence. Canada\'s Secretary for External Affairs Lester Pearson, who went on to become its Prime Minister, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for spearheading UNEF and thus creating the modern concept of a peacekeeping force.\n\nThe Suez Crisis also shaped Indian foreign policy, and was marked as a success of the Non-Aligned Movement in opposing imperialism while also protecting India\'s economic interests (India was one of the top users of the Suez Canal). Indian representatives participated in negotiations on the crisis (including representing Egypt at a peace conference that the country had officially boycotted) and Indian troops participated in the UNEF force, our first such participation as a sovereign republic in a foreign military crisis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat events in the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Should the practice of NIkah Halala be criminalized? This is a practise forcing triple talaqed muslim women to first marry some random guy for few days, have sex and then only she is allowed to remarry her husband. This should be criminalized in my opinion as it is demeaning.'<br />Body: 'This practice is known as Nikkha Halala. It is practised by certain sects of Muslims. And, lot of women undergo this barbaric practice.\n\nIt goes like this.\n\n1. If the Husband gives triple talaq to wife, then from that time, the husband cannot change that decision and remarry wife.\n2. However, the wife can marry anyone else. And, if that guy is dead or divorces her, then she again becomes open to marry anyone except that guy.\n3. And, this is the loophole which these people have found as a way for husband to remarry wife. Like, if the wife marry someone else, have sex, and then that person gives her triple talaq, then that wife is free to marry anyone else except that person. This means, now the wife can marry the first husband as well.\n\nSo, basically, if a situation arises where wife wants to remarry her husband after getting triple talaq, then she is forced to undergo this barbaric practice which was probably originally created to prevent husbands from giving quick triple-talaq without any thought of consequences, but now it is a way for exploitation of these women.\n\nAnd, most often these women undergo this practice on their own because they are so emotionally and socially vulnerable. Like, the people working in the mosques use this as an opportunity to exploit them. The women have to pay the imam few lakh rupees, and then these imams will marry them, then have unprotected sex with them for a while, then give them triple talaq so that she is free to marry her original husband. Imagine if the only way to cancel the divorce is to pay someone else to literally fuck you, and then tell that to the original husband.\n\nIn many cases, if the women is not rich enough to pay the Imamas, or if they want to keep it within the family, the relatives like a brother in law, father in law, other relatives or friends marry her and have sex for few days or weeks, then give her triple talaq. This is what likely happened in the above news. Many times the women give consent due to having no option of saving their marriage and seeing no alternative paths in life, but Rape also often happens as not everyone will be willing to go through this procedure.\n\nThis practice is NOT RARE. It happens around you on a daily basis, yet it rarely makes it to the news because no one involved in it wants to make it news. If a fight happens between husband and wife(very common) and hot-headedly the husband says triple talaq(sometimes happen), but later regrets it and wants to remarry. Baaamm. Nikah Halala it is. And, it is mostly done secretly with someone in the family like the father in law, and then secretly remarry. Another dispute and another triple talaq? Baammm. Nikah Halala again, maybe with brother in law this time.\n\nThink of it like this, if some guy gets to have sex and a lot of money with zero responsibilities or commitment, and this is not considered morally/religious wrong but is encouraged with the moral-boost that you are singlehandedly saving someone\'s marraige, then don\'t you think atleast some of them will go ahead with it?\n\nHowever, there are several sects within the Muslim community who strongly opposes this practice by saying it is a workaround or loophole which is being exploited, but still it happens in several other sects who strongly support it.\n\nThere was an attempt to criminalize Nikah halala last year, but these sects opposed it strongly, like  The All India Muslim Personal Law Board [endorsed Nikah halala and said that this law cannot be challenged in Supreme Court](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslim-law-board-endorses-nikah-halala-says-it-is-quranic-practice-and-cannot-be-challenged-1286497-2018-07-15) since it is Quranic. Weirdly, this happened 4 days ago -  ["Congress will scrap triple talaq law if voted to power, says Rahul Gandhi"](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/congress-will-scrap-triple-talaq-law-if-voted-to-power-rahul-gandhi/story/318095.html).

      <li>Title::: 'Should we tax consumption instead of income?'<br />Body: 'Bill gates once said, "Do not tax my income, tax my consumption." Tax the energy sector and nothing else. This is going to render the tax unevadable. We save govt. money as there would be no need to audit individuals for tax evasion.\n\n*Calculations:*\n\nPer capita consumption of energy for India in 2017 was about 22 gigajoules, and each megajoule of energy, on average, costs about 3.69₹ to produce. 1 gigajoule = 1000 megajoules.\n\nSo, an average man used approximately 22×1000×3.69=81,180₹ worth of energy in 2017. \n\nAssuming there are 1.34 billion people, total energy consumption for our country was worth ₹134×81,180 billion=₹109 trillion. In 2017, the grand total of the union budget was \\~₹25.31 trillion. Which is about 23% of the total energy consumption. \n\nThat should be India\'s consumption tax on the amount of energy that is sold in India by energy producers, we may use a sort of slab system to gradually increase the rates. Escaping that means not receiving any energy-consuming benefit from India. This seems fair. I accept this needs a bit of refinement but lets start from here.\ufeff\n\n  \n\n\n*As a side note*: \n\nThe cost of energy production (1 megajoule) was even lower than this but it increased by a whopping 54% in the financial year of **2011 to 2012**. From 2006-2011, it hovered around 1%. Also, in that same time our population increased abnormally **3 crore 80 lakh**, almost 2.1 crorer more than preceding or even succeeding years. \n\nSource: \\_ENERGY STATISTICS, 2017.\\_ by CENTRAL STATISTICS OFFICE, New Delhi  \n\n\nPlease share your opinions.'<br />Author: 'brien23'  id: 'apedwk'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/apedwk/should_we_tax_consumption_instead_of_income/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'South Indian temple microscosm'<br />Body: "Every important South Indian temple contains within its walls a sacred tree\nsthalavrksa). The tree constitutes one element in a conventional set, which also includes water in some form (a river, a temple tank, the sea) and an image or symbol of the deity, usually fashioned from stone. Analogous to, and sometimes equated with, the image (and the god) is the mountain found near some shrines, together these elements create a microcosm - an 'ideal landscape' of water, rock and tree; enclosed by the temple walls. The walls serve both to isolate the idealized cosmos from the surrounding realm of disorder and to contain within strict limits the potentially dangerous power which is felt to inhere in the sacred site. Tile concept of imposing limits upon powerful forces is basic to the temple cult; for the micro. costa, to be complete, must contain representatives of the primeval chaos out of which the known universe has emerged. Both tree and water belong in part to Chaos. In the classical puranic cosmogonies, creation takes place against the back- ground of the pralaya, the cosmic flood: Visnu rests upon the great serpent Adisesa, who floats upon the waters into which the universe has dissolved. The lotus which rises from Visnu's navel and upon which sits Brahma, the demiurge of creation, becomes the earth rising up from the waters. In some myths land can emerge only after a form of sacrifice: thus from the fat (medas) of Madhu and Kaitabha, slain by Visnu, the earth solidifies in the midst of the waters. In Tamil temple-myths, the entire process of creation takes place at the shrine, which inevitably sees itself as the center or navel of the universe, the one point of land which is never conquered by the flood: it is at this site that Brahmas or Siva burns away the flood-waters and produces the world, while the waters of the primeval deluge are retained within the shrine in the reduced form of the temple tank or lake - a symbol of chaos subdued. And just as below the lotus-world of Brahma there remain the Serpent and the dark water, so the shrine is connected to the nether world, Patala - an area of death and disorder, but also often sources of fertility and power. Almost invariably, the waters of the temple-tank or river are thought to well up from this subterranean region. The tree, too, emerges from Patala. Its roots are sunk deep into the darkness of the earth; hence the nakakkal, the stones sacred to the serpent denizens of the nether world, are strewn about the base of the temple tree. Like the serpent, the tree becomes a symbol of fertility: barren couples worship at the tree and its serpent icons in order to be blessed with progeny. \n\nVitality proceeds from a transcendent source from the hidden reaches of Patala, or from the celestial worlds of the gods. The latter case is often represented by the famous image of the inverted world-tree, with its roots in heaven and branches below. The inverted tree also appears in the myths of Tamil shrines: At Tiruvaraficaram, for example, Visnu waters an upside- down mulli shrub with a watering can without a bottom. In both cases - whether the tree is rooted in Patala or in heaven - the sthalavrksa represents the axis mundi, the vertical link passing through the center of the universe and connecting heaven to the nether world. The symbolic role of the tree in the temple thus embraces at least three related facets: The tree is the\naxis rnundi at the center of the world; it is a natural symbol of creation and fertility, of the growth of new life from a seed; and it is linked to the life-producing yet terrifying realm of primordial chaos which survives under the earth. This association is sustained by another aspect of symbolism - for the tree also recalls the original chaos of the wilderness or forest which opposes its disorder to the regulated world of social life. The wilderness is conquered, sometimes violently, by the advance of civilization. Yet it survives both as a perennial source of new life - a necessary testing-ground of kings and heroes (such as Rama and the Pandavas) no less than the home of ascetics and sages - and as a focus of sacred forces within the ordered and bounded universe of the shrine)\n\n~ [Murukan, the mango and Ekāmbareśvara-Śiva: Fragments of a Tamil creation myth?, Indo-Iranian Journal, 1979, David Shulman](https://www.academia.edu/38261726/Murukan_the_mango_and_Ek%C4%81mbare%C5%9Bvara-%C5%9Aiva_Fragments_of_a_Tamil_creation_myth)"<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'aosu1r'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aosu1r/south_indian_temple_microscosm/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Democracy and The Social Contract - The one concept that Separatists/Commies simply cannot seem to grasp.'<br />Body: 'There\'s this thing... it\'s called democracy. Where you vote for representatives, and then everyone works out a way to live together. There are differences of opinion. Not everyone is happy. But decisions are taken, and the ground rules are worked out, with each person trying to have things a bit more to their liking. And it\'s nowhere near ideal, but it does work (slowly). \n\nBut this is the thing that these Separatists, and Revolutionaries, and Anarchists, and Leftists, and Commies **simply do not understand**.\n\nThat a bunch of retards in a random housing society, (or a street, or a district, or even a state), anywhere in the country can\'t just up and declare \'independence\' and demand \'autonomy\' and the \'right to self-govern\'.  \n\nBecause they\'ll need food, fuel, supplies, electricity, water, roads, defense, garbage disposal, etc. And they\'ll need to pay for every piece of infrastructure, every square inch of land, every historical site, every drop of fuel or sweat or blood that was ever expended by workers or troops or tanks, that went into keeping that land within the country, because all those costs are normally borne (and thus, OWNED) by the collective national social contract - ***which they\'re trying to exit***. So they need to **PAY** to buy all of this out from the national social contract, because they are *removing* it from the nation, and claiming SOLE ownership of it. And one can\'t buy something if it is **not for sale**. \n\nMoreover, they\'ll need to pay for each thing by themselves. And they better not forget to add import/export fees to every product or service they\'ll buy. Guess what we call that. Taxes. *"Whoops, your \'independent country\' is now paying 10x what it used to, due to extra charges. Oh, and sorry, but you need an Indian Passport to freely enter the country. Since all of your passports are void, you\'re kinda stuck there, unless you get a visa. We have no Embassy in your vicinity, please wait patiently till we consider you worth our attention. Hey, did we mention? The airspace around your society is Indian. Please take permission in case you\'re thinking of flying anywhere by helicopter or whatever, or you might be identified as a hostile aircraft of an enemy state."*\n\n#Shared Value and Cost\n\nWhen you buy or sell property within the nation, it\'s not the same as buying or selling property BETWEEN two nations, or OUT of a nation. When you see the listed value of a piece of land or immovable property, that\'s the price of the property ABOVE the **ACTUAL** shared-value of the land. Because that shared value is not being sold. You cannot buy the shade that my skyscraper provides, from me, and I cannot charge a fee from those that lie in its ever-shifting shadow.\n\nIt\'s kind of like GRAVITY. We all live roughly at sea-level, at the bottom of a gravity-well (i.e. Earth), and gravity is pretty much **constant**. So the main cost we need to consider when buying a carrot from China, is the cost of moving it *\'laterally\' along the surface*. The \'vertical\' displacement (and hence the cost of lifting it against gravity) is negligible. The gravity-cost is common, and I do not have a significant gravity-advantage over another Earth-boy. But wanting that same carrot to be shipped to the MOON, will require that extra cost of taking it OUT of our gravity-well. Moon-boy does not share our common gravity. He will need to cover the REAL cost of that object. Meaning a Moon-boy needs to pay a LOT more than Earth-boy, to get those organic carrots from China. \n\nWhen these *"Azadi/Revolucion!"* guys think that \'owning\' a land, or \'buying\' a land by paying INTERNAL prices, or inheriting it, means they have FULL rights over it, and what they do in it, they IGNORE the shared-value that has already been invested into that land by the rest of society. If they want FULL rights, it\'s like lifting that land out of OUR shared social contract, and shipping it to their Moon-based social contract. That\'s waaaaaaaay more expensive. I cannot buy a flat on the New York skyline and then ban people from seeing it, or charge a fee every time someone clicks a picture of the skyline. Same deal. And if they try to seize it by force, let\'s just say it get\'s really expensive and messy, because it\'s like trying to \'steal\' (or take ownership of) something worth 100 trillion dollars, without being able to move it anywhere afterwards.\n\n\nSee, chaps like this... \n\n#They break the Social Contract of a Democracy\n\nIf you are born in a democracy, or visit a democracy, or live in a democracy, via choice, or compulsion, or pure accident, **you are automatically subject to the social contract that exists there.** You have signed it by merely existing within those borders.\n\nYou have *all the independence you want*, **as long as you follow the ground rules that everyone has decided upon together.** One of the ground rules is that YOU have a say in the rule-making too, and you FOLLOW the same rules. If there are rules you don\'t like, you can find alternatives and gather support for them, and implement them. But **until they are implemented**, you continue to be subject to the current rules. Thus, by actively participating, you make the whole society a bit more like you envision it, and a bit less of what bothers you. \n\nIf this is not for you, ***you are free to leave***. *EMIGRATE*. Find a deserted island or a society willing to take you in. Maybe a commie paradise? Or an Islamist theocracy? Or a liberal utopia? *Good luck and bon voyage!* We *genuinely* wish you all the best. You can "self-govern" and "self-determine" all you like, **over there** (*IF* they allow you to). \n\n#But not here. \n\nIf you stay here, **you agree to the social contract of this land**, as soon as you or anyone sets foot on its soil, and until you step off it.\n\nDon\'t come demanding your own **territory** from the collective that is the nation. Those borders and the territory contained within them are ALL OF OURS. They are part of our social contract. You have no claim on them. Asking the **rest of us** to alter our borders that provide us all **security and sovereignty** will come at a price that is far too high for anyone. You can\'t afford it, and it isn\'t for sale anyway.\n\nSo either follow the democratic processes (follow laws, write complaint letters, help make laws, bring about change, vote, contribute, pay taxes, earn money legally, etc) OR LEAVE (emigrate, defect, apply for refugee status, smuggle yourself in a box, nobody really cares). If you choose to stay, and STILL break the social contract, then you will face action that is derived from the social contract you have already signed by virtue of staying here. That action may include fees, public service, fines, humiliation, arrest, asset-forfeiture, incarceration, physical violence, and death. \n\nOur dear Kashmiri Separatists don\'t grasp this fact. Nor do our Lemurian Dravidanadu friends. It is irrelevant. \n\nThat port in Chennai belongs to EVERY Indian. They can shriek *\'Lemuriaaa\'* all they want, it\'s not for sale (and they can\'t afford it anyway, even if they put the entire state for sale). That defensive border in Kashmir belongs to EVERY Indian. They can yell *\'Azadiiii*\' all they want, it\'s not gonna change the fact that every Indian from Jammu to Kerala has contributed over successive generations, in terms of money, manpower, capital, skills, time, and services, (no matter how tangentially, or how indirectly) towards that border, and the land within that.

      <li>Title::: 'Sveiki r/Lithuania, our cultural exchange is now live!'<br />Body: "\nGreetings /r/IndiaSpeaks, today we would be hosting our friends from r/Lithuania for a cultural exchange that will last till late Sunday. \nThe purpose of this event is to allow people from two different nations to get and share knowledge about their respective cultures, daily life, history and answer each other's curiosities, this allows for a more engaging cultural exchange and for users to learn more about each other's countries. Lithuanian users will ask their questions and Indians answer them here on r/IndiaSpeaks while Indians ask their questions in r/Lithuania to be answered by Lithuanian users. Sounds good?\n\nGeneral rules of Reddit and the respective subreddits apply on both sides and any troll/hate/edgy/hostile comments won't be tolerated. Please be respectful of one another. Remember to have civil discussions and no drama please.\n\nI hope the exchange turns out eventful and I personally would like it if all of you could actively participate in the cultural exchange. I would once again like to thank the mods of r/Lithuania for giving us the privilege to host them.\n\n\nTo get you started, here are some interesting facts about Lithuania!\n\n\n**The Lithuanian language is the oldest in Europe**\n\n\nThe language family that most European languages belong to is Indo-European, but they started splitting apart from each other probably around 3500 BCE. They developed into dozens of other languages like German, Italian, and English, gradually losing the features that they had all shared. One language, however, up in the Baltic language branch of the Indo-European family, retained more of the feature of what linguists call Proto-Indo-European (PIE), which is the language that they postulate was spoken around 3500 BCE. For whatever reason, Lithuanian has kept more of the sounds and grammar rules from PIE than any of its linguistic cousins, words, such as vyras (man), šuo (dog), avis (sheep) which cognate in Sanskrit. It means that Lithuanians can recognize some words while listening to Indian language.\n\n\n**Lithuania has two independence days**\n\n\nLithuania’s first Act of Independence took place on the 16th of February 1918. The country had been annexed by the Russian empire in the late 1700s, and had remained under Russian rule until the end of World War I. The Act of February 16 created what is now the Republic of Lithuania. Lithuania remained an independent republic until the 1940s. During World War II, the country was occupied by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany. As the war neared its end, the German forces retreated and the Soviet Union reoccupied the country. For almost half a century Lithuania remained part of the Soviet Union. The country declared itself independent of the Soviet Union on 11th March 1990. Their declaration of independence was the first by a state from the Soviet Union and predated the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union by a year.\n\n\n**The Stelmuze oak in Lithuania is the oldest tree in Europe, having survived The Crusades**\n\n\nThe Stelmuze oak is the oldest tree in Lithuania and in Europe. It grows in the Stelmuze village, located in eastern Lithuania near the Latvian border. What makes this oak so special and famous? Obviously, its age. The Stelmuze oak is about 2000 years old: unfortunately, since the inner part of the trunk has been removed, it's difficult to tell its exact age. It is massive and still living. The oak measures 3.5m in diameter and 13m in girth at its widest part; at waist level, it is 2.8m in diameter and 9.58m in girth. It's 23m in height, and the trunk is dead: only the side branches remaining alive. According to legend, the Baltic god of Thunder Perkūnas was worshipped beneath this tree by pagans.\n\n\n**Feel free to participate and ask more questions about Lithuania over on this thread [HERE]( https://www.reddit.com/r/lithuania/comments/ao20lu/cultural_exchange_with_rindiaspeaks/)**"<br />Author: 'Scype_crisis'  id: 'aof2tf'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aof2tf/sveiki_rlithuania_our_cultural_exchange_is_now/</li>

The colour palette is a combination of only 5 colours – the *Pancha-Varnas* — *Red, Yellow, Green, Black &amp; White*. This scheme gives an earthy but vibrant look that results in a very unique stylistic look to the murals. The colouring materials are natural ingredients — minerals, oils, herbal and plant juices — that have to be mixed in the right chemistry. Even the brushes have to be carefully self-manufactured — animal hairs for heavy and medium applications and delicate grass for fine applications. \n\nDifferent colour schemes depict different characters/emotions: Green is Satvik, Red &amp; Yellow are Rajasik and White is Tamasik. Black often depicts evil. Preparing a wall for a fresco takes about 25 days, when different coats of lime, sand, jaggery, coconut water, lemon juice and other bio-products are applied in a defined sequence. Even the painting must be done in 6 different stages (the painting of the eyes always comes last) after which the artist does samarpanam (submission or offering).\n\nThere are various schools in Kerala which is aiming to develop artists in this traditional art form and it takes 5 years to get a degree in this art form.'<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'ano6xn'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ano6xn/kerala_mural_paintings/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'You should know about Operation Decoy - when UPA bravely upheld democracy in Jharkand....not'<br />Body: 'You are fucking joking but this literally happened. \n\nWhen the Jharkand elections of 2005 resulted in a hung assembly, 5 independent MLA\'s agreed to support the BJP. The NDA promptly paraded them in front of the very neutral and democracy loving Governor, Syed Sibtey Razi\xa0. \n\nHowever this career congressi must have learnt Math the same place Pappu and his father did because he thought that the 36 MLA\'s of Shibu Soren was &gt; 41 MLA\'s of NDA in a 81 member house. The NDA, justifiably angry said they will present all 41 MLA\'s in front of the Governors boss, Kalam. Soren meanwhile hastily took charge as CM. \n\nBarmaid in collusion with Shibu Soren yes, the very same freedom loving, peaceful barmaid then decided to literally take the 5 independents and possibly bribe or beat (we don\'t know) them into supporting Soren. \n\nnDA grandly announced that all 41 would be boarding a flight to Delhi, the flight number was "slipped" to media. At the appointed time all 41 boarded the plane. Jharkand police then raided the plane and to their surprise saw that 5 were random people and the real independents were missing. \n\nNow thoroughly fucked, Soren ordered all roads closed to Chatisgarh and Orissa (then under NDA Ally Biju Patnaik)  under the assumption that they would take the independents to a safe BJP state and then fly them out. \n\nThe MLA\'s though slipped into Bengal (then ruled by the hostile commies), then took a train to Bhubaneshwar (Kolkata would have been too risky). Then the BJP began a disinformation campaign full of lies that Pappu would be proud of. The MLA\'s are in Gujarat, oops they are in C\'garh, oops they are in Lakshadweep..... They were even afraid of being caught in Delhi because Soren had filed a police complaint that they had been kidnapped. Using this FIR, Delhi police under Barmaid and Sheila aunty could simply detain them. \n\nWhen the real flight arrived the entire leadership of BJP, 10\'s of thousands of cadre were at the airport to forestall any move by the Delhi police. \n\nFinally the 41 made it in front of Kalam ji. \n\nA stellar supporting role was played by Balmunchu the speaker of the new house. The SC asked him to conduct a vote of confidence (before this escape drama), he did. The UPA MLa\'s made noise and he simply adjourned the house. Iirc he did it twice and then "gave up". \n\nSuch is how Pappu\'s mom, the Barmaid fought for DemoCRaCy.

आंदोलन?\n\n.\n1947 में आजादी के बाद से ही पाकिस्तान की सत्ता में पंजाबी\nऔर लॉबी का कब्ज़ा रहा है। आर्मी हो या राजनीतिक\nताकतें, या फिर बड़ी बिजनेस इंडस्ट्रीज़ हर जगह पंजाबी लॉबी\nका कब्जा है। इसके

बराबर है।\nजिसके चलते सालों साल से एक दर्द और गुस्से का गुबार जमा\nहोता रहा। जो फूटा 2014 में। जब पाकिस्तानी आर्मी ने\nअफगानिस्तान बॉर्डर से सटे इलाकों में ऑपरेशन ज़र्ब-ए-अज़्ब शुरू\nकिया।\n\n.\nपाकिस्तान ने दावा किया वो वो अपनी सीमा में बसे\nतालिबान को खत्म करना चाहती है। इस ऑपरेशन की जद में\nतहरीके-तालिबान-पाकिस्तान, लश्कर-ए-झांगवी और हक्कानी\nनेटवर्क के सफाये की बात कही गयी। लेकिन हुआ ये कि\nपाकिस्तानी आर्मी ने इन इलाकों में बसे करीब 50 लाख पश्तूनों\nको उज़ाड़ दिया। आतंकवाद के सफाये के बहाने हज़ारों पश्तूनों\nका कत्लेआम हुआ। बस्तिय़ां तबाह कर दी गयी। पश्तूनों पर

      <li>Title::: 'Why did Vivekananda accuse Buddhism for the downfall of India by Abhinav Singhal'<br />Body: 'Swami Vivekananda was of the belief that Buddhist principles of Ahimsa lead to the downfall of India. It demilitarised India with more number of people, especially Kshatriya clans, adopting non violence and Buddhism and giving up arms completely. This further resulted in India being conquered by foreign powers. This statement of Swami Vivekananda is highly contested by, seems to me, to be somewhat true. I will try to present some facts in favour of as well as against this argument.\n\nWhen Alexander invaded India, he encountered severe resistance in the North western frontiers, now in Afghanistan and Pakistan and could barely move forward. He witnessed very hostile common people and villagers who would attack the Greeks as soon as they set foot in their village. Plato and Strabo have admitted this. Alexander has written about this in his letters to his mother and Aristotle.\n\nStrabo - India - Alexander Sources\n\nPeace For Afghanistan\n\nA letter from Alexander the Great to his Mother!\n\nCut to around 200–250 years later, after the fall of the Mauryan empire. Now, The major kingdom in North India was the shunga empire. The north west was again divided into small kingdoms, as it was before the Mauryas. The Greeks started to attack again. And this time, they were successful!! They established the Indo Greek kingdom in the north western parts of the then India, which now include Pakistan and parts of Punjab. They tried to capture the mainland India ( present day India and Bangladesh) but were repelled by the Shunga king Pushyamitra Shunga and the King Kharavela ( the greatest king of Orissa and one of the greatest kings in Indian history). But, here is the catch!! The Indo Greeks, as they were called, supported Buddhism to a huge extent. Many of their kings even converted to buddhism!!\n\nhttp://hellenicpoetry.com/uncate...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me...\n\nAs suggested by the above articles, The Buddhists supported the Greeks and helped them in their rule. On the other hand, Buddhism flourished under the Greeks rulers. It is even suggested that the Greeks invaded India to protect Buddhism from Shungas. But this doesn’t hold water as I an going to prove now. We first need to note one important point. Since Buddhism travelled to China via Pakistan and Afghanistan, these regions became heavily influenced by Buddhist thought. In fact, these regions were the one which had the highest number of buddhist followers and great buddhist universities as well, like Takshshila, Valabhi etc. On the other hand, rest of the India remained relatively less influenced by Buddhism. Also, this was the time when Hinduism constantly lost out to buddhism in debates or “shastrarths”.\n\nShunga dynasty, ruled by Pushyamitra Shunga is accused by Buddhists of destroying Buddhist temples and killing monks. Pushyamitra was hated by Buddhists.\n\nPushyamitra Shunga - Wikipedia\n\nBut, as mentioned in the above article by many historians including some “Marxist historians” like Romila Thapar, the killings of Buddhists by Shunga was political and not religious. Marxist historians are famous for accusing Hinduism of destroying Buddhism. So, the thoughts of Romila Thapar on this issue regarding Shunga can’t be taken lightly. It is also well known that later Shunga rulers were patrons of buddhism and built many buddhist temples.\n\nThis means that Shunga was against Buddhism because Buddhists supported the Greeks, who were his arch rivals. It is also strange to note that the Indo greeks were not attacked by common villagers just like the way they attacked Alexander. They were instead loved by their people whereas Alexander faced hostility all around in North western India. How is this possible?\n\nThe only logic behind this can be : The Greeks were getting inside support from the native people living the north western India, unlike Alexander, and these people majorly followed Buddhism. This inside support helped them in conquering the North western parts of India. This support infuriated Pushyamitra Shunga and he hence started to oppose Buddhism. Buddhism here became the cause for the downfall of the North western frontiers of the Mainland/heartland India.\n\nThe Greeks were followed by the indo parthians and indo scynthians. These powers too ruled the North western parts of India and fought constantly to gain control of mainland India ( Current India and Bangladesh) but were always repelled by Indian powers like the Satavahna empire ( which produced a very famous ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni ). What was common during the rule of Parthians and Scynthians was their love for Buddhism. Buddhism emerged as the chief religion of these kingdoms. On the other hand, Mainland India remained majorly Hindu ( it had considerable buddhist followers but was majorly Hindu ).\n\nThe scynthians were followed by the Kushans. These Kushans were the first foreign power to rule India. Earlier invaders like Scynthins, Parthians etc ruled only the North western frontiers. The mainland India at that time was the Gangetic planes along with the central Indian regions and regions around Orissa and South India under cholas , cheras and pandyas. The Kushans were the first power who conquered and ruled parts of this Mainland India. This was the first time in history India was under foreign occupation.\n\nBut, the story still remained the same. The Kushans were avid followers of Buddhism and they still had this inside help. They adopted Indian culture, took Sanskrit names, had a typical Indian army, the administration policies, music, art and architecture were all Indian. Though they originated in Bactrea and then expanded into India, they became more Indian then Bactrean!! In fact, they weren’t able to expand into India until they had adopted Indian culture. The reason why their conquests in the mainland were successful was that the mainland, at that time had no strong native power. The people hence accepted Kushans as rulers because they couldn’t exactly differentiate between native indian rulers and the Kushans. This was because of the highly Indianised nature of Kushans. Had this not happened, they wouldn’t have had been able to conquer the mainland. This Indianisation of the Kushans introduced them to Hinduism. Now, the tides started to change!! The kushans started to adopt Hinduism. Their greatest king was Kanishka the great, who followed Hinduism. The adoption of Hinduism, naturally, gave the Kushans even more acceptance in the mainland than ever before. This was a watershed moment for them. Because after this, they were able to capture Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha, which was synonymous to Delhi at that time. Kanishka was even expand into central India and captured parts of Orissa as well.\n\nThe earlier Kushans couldn’t penetrate this deep into India. Why is this so? because they had not been Indianised and were not acceptable to the locals who constantly fought them.\n\nIndo-Greek Kingdom - Wikipedia\n\nIndo-Scythians - Wikipedia\n\nIndo-Parthian Kingdom - Wikipedia\n\nKushan Empire - Wikipedia\n\nKanishka - Wikipedia\n\nBut, their adoption of Hinduism and later on its propagation by them led to a revival of Hinduism. This revival of Hinduism also led to the emergence of a native Indian power, The Gupta Empire!! Under the Gupta empire, Hinduism underwent a complete rebirth.\n\nHinduism as a religion was predominantly vocal until the time The Gupta’s came. The texts such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata etc were never written down. All religious knowledge was transmitted orally from one generation to another. On the other hand, Buddhism was very well recorded and every piece of religious text was written down. This written nature of Buddhism was the chief cause of its quick expansion and propagation. Whereas no written record meant that Hinduism lost out to Buddhism.\n\nThis was the chief reason why The Ramayana, Mahabharata and other religious texts were written down under The Gupta’s. Hindu thought now propagated through written text material as well as oral transmission. This reform led to a stronger Hinduism.\n\nA stronger Hinduism meant a large martial population. There is nothing wrong with Buddhism except for its principle of non-violence. We all know what happened to the Buddhists of Tibet just because they were non-violent. On the other hand, Hinduism promoted martial culture and professed an individual to go to war, if need be. The Kshatriyas were to be ready to fight whenever and wherever the need be.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu...\n\nDid you ever wonder why Buddhism disappeared from India?? Simply because the Buddhists were not able to withstand the onslaught of the Islamic invaders and the Huns. They couldn’t fight and were hence killed or converted. The Huns attacked many times but were always defeated by the Gupta’s. When the Gupta’s became weak, the Huns attacked again and this time uprooted the empire and captures huge chunks of India. These Huns hated Buddhism and destroyed Buddhist temples and killed monks. Though they were later defeated by a combined army of Bhanugupta and Yashodharman, the damage was done.\n\nHuna Invasions of India\n\nAs a proof of what happens when non violence becomes the rule of thumb for a empire, I would present the case of the Gajapati Empire.\n\nGajapati Kingdom - Wikipedia\n\nAs mentioned in the article above, The Gajapati, once a mighty kingdom, declined due to demilitarisation because of a Bhakti Movement. This Bhakti Movement led to a large number of Kshatriyas giving up their arms which in turn led to the fall of the empire.\n\nWhen Buddhism had its clout over India, large number of Kshatriyas adopted non violence leading to demilitarisation. Even though there was a revival in Hinduism under the Gupta’s, the harm was already done!! What kind of harm?? There is a very interesting hypothesis related to this. Though, it is disputable, but it certainly makes some sense.\n\nSince a large number of Kshatriyas gave up arms, including many Kings, this led to the disappearance of many warrior clans. Historically, Kshatriyas in India have always claimed their ancestry to different godly clans. For example, there are Raghuvanshi, who claim descend from Lord Krishna, there are Ikshvaku, Chandravanshi, Suryavanshi etc. Kshatriyas followed a tradition of fighting wars. This led to many other famous clans of Kshatriyas. But, when adoption of Buddhism began, a large number of Kshatriya clans disappeared. They adopted Buddhism and hence, the tradition of fighting wars that they followed for hundreds of years was broken.\n\nWhen Hindu revival began, there was need for more Kshatriyas and warriors to fight. So, a new group of people started to emerge by the name called “Rajputs”. They called themselves the sons of kings and Kshatriyas who ruled India hundreds of years before. In short, they claimed ancestry from those Kshatriyas who had earlier adopted Buddhism. They started to claim ancestry from Raghuvansh, Chandravansh and so on. This Group “ Rajputs” gained immense power and started to rule Their own kingdoms later on.\n\nThe original Kshatriya clans perished with time after adopting Buddhism but new ones sprang up who claimed ancestry from the previous ones. The events that support this theory is the fact that the term Rajput first came into being in the 5th-6th century, during the Hindu revival period. This was also the time when India started to re-militarise!! This can’t be a mere co-incidence.\n\nWe all know about the rivalry between the Rajput kings of different factions. If we assume the hypothesis mentioned above to be true, we can explain the reason for this intense rivalry as well. The reason I believe is very natural. When 2 different people lay claim to a common thing, there is bound to be animosity between those 2 people. The same goes for the Rajputs!! All of them were claiming ancestry to some clan or the other and were vouching for power. These claims and this fight for power was the chief cause of this rivalry.\n\nSince, there was no major power after the Gurjar Pratiharas, Palas and the Rashtrakutas in India, the Rajputs took over and kept on fighting amongst themselves for power. This lack of unity and their internal tussle led to India getting conquered by Islamic invasions. Had this animosity been absent and had there been some unity, we all know what would have happened.\n\nThis explains almost all events that happened in history. This hypothesis fits our story!!\n\nIt is out in the open to approve or disprove it. But, it fits our timeline as well.\n\nBecause of all these reasons, Swami Vivekananda said that Buddhism was the chief cause of India’s downfall. Demilitarisation was the primary cause for this downfall and non violence was the culprit.\n\nOrigin of Rajputs\n\nHistory of the Origin of the Rajputs | Indian History\n\nEDIT 1 : We know about the rules of warfare described in Mahabharata and other texts such as Dharmashastras. These rules of warfare were followed in Ancient India. But, with the arrival of Chanakya and his policies, wars became almost random without any rule. Chanakya prescribed the use of deceit in wars and this was followed by the Mauryas and later on the Gupta’s . But, with the arrival of Rajputs, we again see some codes of warfare which seem quite similar to those rules which were prescribed in Mahabharat and Dharmashastras. The Kshatriyas had abandoned those rules of warfare from the time of the Mauryas but again started following them with the arrival of Rajputs.\n\nThis can be explained by the hypothesis mentioned above. Since the Rajputs claimed ancestry from those clans that existed much before, they also followed all the principles of war that those clans used to follow. Since they called themselves their descendants, they followed their chivalrous conduct as well. These rules were not followed by the kings and warriors who ruled during the Mauryas, Guptas or during the Vardhan empire.\n\nThis sudden re-emergence of these principles of war also fits well in the hypothesis mentioned above.'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'anbpe9'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/anbpe9/why_did_vivekananda_accuse_buddhism_for_the/</li>

I\'ve a feeling this might be untrue and spread via Whatsapp rumors. Correct me if I\'m wrong,\n\nI\'d like to know is there any accurate statement available regarding this. From what I\'m hearing all day if the orders were given &amp; still Bengal police interfered with the investigation it means the current Bengal government had instructed them to do so.\n\nIf this is the case then Mamta Banerjee has indeed shot on her foot which gives the opposition a leverage stating she has a Fascist regime, Consolidating the police and trying to suppress other investigation agencies to operate gives total dictatorship vibes.\n\n\nVarious party is in support to Mamta claiming BJP is using the CBI, As far as I know this wasn\'t some raid in a political figure home. Just questioning as per the orders received from the Supreme Court which is an autonomous division in our country. How does this turns into a political debate?\n\nAlso Rahul Gandhi showing support to Mamta when an earlier video shows him questioning Mamta for the chit-fund scam is indeed a political suicide. Hi stance on this weakens the party standings as the Congress were the ones that demanded investigation on the scam. I doubt opposition would want anyone else with some background knowledge like Shashi Tharoor to lead the Congress party when the current leader is in split with his decisions like Trump.\n\nI did ask 2 Bengali colleagues that have spent their entire childhood in Bengal &amp; have recently moved here, they claim that people voted her in to oust the previous far left due to the Maoist insurgency and corruption and with the hope for more jobs but she indeed proved to be the Achilles heel in governance as her methods were based on Thuggery and controlling autonomous institutions. They did claim it was indeed a mistake which cannot be changed even with changing governments as everything is controlled by TMC party workers and unless you\'re willing to grease their palms nothing can be done.\n\nThrowing my own scoop of shit: also browsed reddit India and it was no astonishment to me that there are no mentions about this anywhere in that sub only to realise later that they were removed which is nothing new.

      <li>Title::: "Excerpt from 'RISA Lila – 2 – Limp Scholarship And Demonology'"<br />Body: ' \n\nBelow are some archetypes to interpret this RISA Lila in terms of Biblical myths that appear to **subconsciously drive many RISA scholars’ behavior**, despite professing secularism. “Liberals” hate the thought of being associated with such George Bushisms as “Good versus Evil”. But because these archetypes operate subliminally, one cannot blame the scholars, who are, after all, not aware of these behavior patterns.\n\nOne close Christian friend and academic scholar of religion read this essay and pointed out that she considered this entire section to be a matter of “ridicule” and “cheap shots” against her faith. But, it is precisely this kind of scholarship that is being applied to the interpretation of Hindu myths, for which the Wendy School has become so famous, and has won awards and prestigious appointments. My friend’s emotional outburst against what she considers to be a “tendentious caricature” of Christianity is telling for two reasons: (i) It goes to show how much psychoanalysis is yet to be done to interpret modern Western society in terms of Biblical myths. (ii) It demonstrates how similar ordinary Hindus and Christians (including secular Christian scholars) are when it comes to such emotional reactions concerning their respective faiths. My friend is quick to point out that “two wrongs do not make a right,” so I apologize in advance if there are any hurt feelings cause by what follows below.\n\nAt the same time, many Christian and Jewish friends and scholars have complemented this section as the best part of this essay, and have expressed great interest in further pursuing its proposed research ideas.\n\n**The absolute nature of Evil:**\n\nIn Hinduism, the essence of every self is the Ultimate Reality and Supreme Being –\xa0*“Thou art that”*\xa0– and the equivalent of Evil is avidya (ignorance) that masks this truth. On the other hand, in the Bible, because of the Original Sin of Adam-Eve, every human being is condemned to Eternal Damnation. The contrast could not be greater: The self is the\xa0Original Divinity\xa0in Hinduism, and the self is the\xa0Original Sinner\xa0in Abrahamic religions. The cosmology of God versus Satan in the Bible divides everything into Good/Evil essences that play out on Earth. By contrast, Ishvara in Hinduism has no external enemy, and everything is internalized with no “other” to blame.\n\nFor instance, in the Mahabharata, the enemies are not “Evil”, but are simply people like us – in fact, our relatives – who are violating the dharma and must be fought. Therefore, in the evenings, when the war is in “pause” mode, the elders from the warring sides meet in harmony to have intellectual discussions, and remain above the animosities. In Abrahamic cultures, the “other” is essentialized as Evil in an absolute manner and “fraternizing with the enemy” is a crime in its own right.\n\nIn the case of RISA, this archetype makes it problematic for most scholars to work with the Diaspora Hindu “others”. It has made it difficult for RISA leaders to appreciate why I wish to engage in intellectual discourse with them while at the same time disagreeing with them, not essentializing them as Evil but as ignorant and selfish.\n\n**The Chosen People:**\n\nWhile at first only the Jews were given “chosen people” status by God, He later amended his rules and extended the offer to all human beings,\xa0provided\xa0they accepted the History of God’s one Son on Earth as unique and unquestionable. This offer by God operates as a sort of opt-in history club, where belief in the specific history – as memorialized in the charter of the club – is the\xa0sole\xa0basis for one’s Redemption upon death and entitlement to a condominium in Heaven forever.\n\nRecently, (pseudo) intellectualism, based on the liberal arts and humanities, spun off as another elitist club where membership is based on acceptance and use of certain “theories” that are always by Europeans and that privilege Eurocentric ideas as being universal.\n\nSome RISA scholars have built fortresses to remain separate from the Hindu “laity,” such that any engagements with the latter are depicted as being a big favor on the part of the scholars.\n\n**Martyrdom and Victimhood:**\n\nMost Christian saints were martyrs – killed by Evil others – whereas in Hindu-Buddhist history, saints were always\xa0*living*\xa0saints and not because they died in action in “Good against Evil” battles. Related to this is the archetype of victimhood, where a Good Victim” is glorified and becomes a role model. Jesus is history’s most famous victim, central to God’s own personal plan for humanity.\n\nThis archetype has played out in Western society in the form of glorifying victimhood as a sign of being “Good”. A major industry in the US is for rich lawyers to help “victims,” defined as anyone who had coffee spilled on them, or had “emotional damage,” or is upset at others for some reason that qualifies for litigation. There are over a million such lawsuits annually in USA. These lawyers outspend all other categories of advertisers in yellow pages advertising. They secure their clients “Retribution,” which is another Biblical archetype.\n\nTherefore, Western human rights activists, and non-Westerners trained and funded by them, go around the world creating new categories of “victims” that can be used in divide-and-conquer strategies against other cultures. In India’s case, the largest funding of this type goes to middlemen who can deliver narratives about “abused” Dalits and native (especially Hindu) women.\n\nVictim glorification in Western culture extends beyond humans. Every year, before Thanksgiving Day, US television broadcasts video clips of the turkey that has been chosen as the White House Thanksgiving Dinner Turkey. It is presented as a great honor to be eaten at the White House. Television commercials for Sunkist Tuna show a fish explaining how proud it is to be worthy of being canned in a Sunkist can, because not every fish would qualify.\n\nIn almost every encounter that I have had with RISA, they are quick to adopt the “victim” role. In fact, this was the biggest weapon that was used in this RISA Lila to end the petition: The small handful of “threats” by anonymous persons was ignored for too long by those responsible for the petition, because they did not understand the politics of victimhood. The interjection by Shiv Sena was another bad event as it enhanced the “scholar victim” sympathy factor. Hindus leaders must understand the myths that drive others’ subliminal behavior, and must learn to think strategically.\n\n**Any means for Good to defeat Evil is justified:**\n\nThe Biblical meaning of human life is expressed in narratives about fighting on God’s “Good” side to defeat Satan’s “Evil” side. By contrast, Hindu and Buddhist philosophies do not have any Satan “out there”. This Biblical archetype has played out in history as Good versus Evil political theory, and is nowadays being used to justify taking control over the world’s oil supply in order to put it in the “Good” hands.\n\nLikewise, Pincince, Brown, Zydenbos and some others are seen by many RISA colleagues as justified in fabricating whatever it takes for the sake of defeating the “Evil” Hindu Diaspora. It naturally follows that the “Good” side’s methods are not to be subject to ethical scrutiny. The end justifies the means – hence, the silence when RISA violates its own rules for “civil” conduct.\n\n**Freedom of the Good side to conquer the Earth:**\n\nIt is God’s ultimate wish that the Good (being God’s People) shall rule. In this day and age, the distribution channels by which knowledge gets filtered, selected, packaged, positioned, and spread into every corner of society are the most important institutions that the Good People must control in order to rule.\n\nHence, Motilal Banarsidas, as the only non-Western major academic-grade publishing channel on Indology, must be brought under the control of the Good People of RISA.\n\nMotilal is to be allowed freedom only so long as it performs what the RISA scholars want. The moment it exerts its own commercial independence in the same manner as every Western publisher does, it is to be bombed out of existence, just as “democracy and freedom” are to be imposed upon another country even against its own will. Freedom only applies to the Good side.\n\n**Original Sin and guilt-by-association:**\n\nThe Original Sin in the Bible caused all humans worldwide to be declared “condemned”, as guilty-by-association. In the centuries-long witch-hunting by the Church in Europe, any association with any condemned symbol, organization, relationship – no matter how indirect or casual – was grounds to be persecuted by the Church, whose police powers would make today’s Islamic fatwas look benign by comparison.\n\nOne of the sure ways to condemn someone was to charge that he or she had had sexual intercourse with the Devil. The Inquisition would then pry into the most intimate imaginable details of the guilty-by-association accused person. The burden to prove his or her innocence was only rarely achieved.\n\n**Demonology as the hermeneutics of guilt-by-association:**\n\nThe Church theologians perfected a sophisticated tool-box of intellectual devices to prove guilt-by-association, and this became known as Demonology.\n\nThe Wicca religion was the first to be demonized, and the language started to reflect this. This is why “wicked” (from wicca) has an evil connotation, because it is a description of the Wicca people. Witches are now considered to be bad, suspect and outright dangerous, but at one time they were simply priestesses of pre-Christian European religions.\n\nTour guides in Romania inform visitors that Count Dracula was a very nice ruler who did a lot for his people. But his enemies demonized him so successfully that today his name is synonymous with Evil.\n\nThe thugs were a jati in India that fought against the British very fiercely and violently, and the British classified them officially as a “criminal tribe.” Today, their jati’s name is commonly accepted as a pejorative that means being criminal.\n\nHuman rights activist Vandana Shiva describes how the West demonized the “beedi” child-labor to fill the pockets of multinationals.\n\nVeena Oldenburg’s book,\xa0*Dowry Murder,*\xa0explains how the British demonized native culture by blaming it for all sorts of social problems that were not caused by the culture, and, in fact, in many cases, were caused by the British. This enabled them to enact new “human rights” laws to save the natives from Indian culture, and, in the process, to expropriate massive amounts of property in India.\n\nToday, Christian evangelists openly say that Hindu deities are demons.\n\nMany Hindu gurus – such as Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Muktananda and others – have become demonized by RISA scholars. This is a part of the Evil Brahmin Conspiracy Theory that is often the meta-narrative of certain RISA scholarship, in an attempt to demonize the Sanskrit traditions and texts. Under the pretence of using what is a discredited Freudian analytic framework, many attributes of Hindu deities are given a heavy pornographic gloss by many RISA scholars.\n\nNumerous examples from the RISA-l archives demonstrate how Demonology principles get applied today, even by supposedly liberal and secular scholars.\xa0While untouchability has been outlawed in India, it seems to have become reincarnated in RISA.\xa0Demonology is the method being used to create new untouchables. Individuals and institutions that challenge RISA’s hegemony are to be demonized and turned into untouchables.\n\nThe strategy behind RISA’s Demonology is to try to brand Diaspora opponents as untouchables, so that others will fear association with them.\n\nFor example, Jack Hawley of Barnard College has – with the help of Indian students under his direction – branded me as the “rich Rajiv Malhotra” who he accuses of buying up scholars with money and using money to “construct a new Hinduism” that would not be embarrassing. Prior demonology has tried to turn Subhash Kak and others into untouchables, and now Pincince attempted to use guilt-by-association with Kak to also turn\xa0*The Infinity Foundation*\xa0into another untouchable. The strategy behind all this is to discourage RISA scholars from working with the foundation.\n\nPhysical genocides are unlawful, but turning the Hindu Diaspora into a metaphorical Evil/Untouchable has become a highly prized skill in RISA today.\n\n**Appropriation of symbolic capital:**\n\nAnother kind of takeover by the Good side is of symbols of conquered (Evil) peoples. Many pagan symbols such as the “Christmas” tree, “Easter” eggs, etc. were hijacked even as the pagans were genocided. Native Americans have successfully sued in US courts to put a stop to the appropriations and distortions of their symbols for all sorts of frivolous uses – sports team names, etc. – by a culture which the Native Americans regard as the reason for their genocide.\n\nLikewise, yoga, meditation and Bharat Natyam are among the latest Hindu symbols being rapidly taken over by Christianity, while in parallel, other sacred symbols – such as Ganesha – that cannot be Christianized are being denigrated into oblivion. This dynamic must be examined in the context of symbols as a form of capital. What can be appropriated as positive serves to boost the portfolio of the conqueror, and what remains unavailable is trashed so as to turn it into a liability of the other side.\n\nRamdas Lamb explained this as follows[\\[44\\]](http://creative.sulekha.com/risa-lila-2-limp-scholarship-and-demonology_103560_blog#44):\xa0*“Western academia rightly claims to promote multicultural awareness. Additionally, however, it also has the potential and tendency to promote a hegemonic Westernized globalization, in which it picks and chooses which aspects of other cultures are to be considered acceptable and which aspects can be denigrated and rejected at will. In this way, some elements of Western scholarship not only ignore other cultures’ self views, but express a disdain for them in much the same way as the colonialists of the past.”*\xa0I have previously called this “academic arson,” and developed The U-Turn Theory to explain it.\n\nAAR 2002 had as its major presentation a Christianized Bharat Natyam dance (featuring the story of Jesus/Mary). Prof. Arti Dhand and another young Indian woman – both heavily dressed in native costumes – were displayed as “good” Hindus who appreciated this. Dhand then gave a remarkable paper that was a response to a Hindu group’s complaints over the Christianized performance. (My assumption is that the group was HICAD, but I cannot be sure.) Her central thesis was that the dance technique and symbolism are in the public domain for anyone to claim, and that she, as a Hindu, approved of Christianizing the dance because the “only thing that mattered” was the genuineness of feelings with which it was performed. Since the dancer’s feelings were sincere, she said, the Christian Bharat Natyam was a good thing. The audience gave her a big applause.\n\nHowever, Dhand’s analysis of what was going on was too narrow and shallow. The broader canvas required to contextualize the issue seemed to have escaped her completely. She did not start with a good purva-paksha in the first place.\n\nSymbols are a form of capital – see Pierre Bourdieu’s theories of cultural capital for more background. Competing civilizations hijack opponents’ symbols to boost their own capital, and denigrate others’ symbols to lower others brand value. This principle is known to anyone with even a rudimentary background in any competitive field, such as marketing. To make her position tenable, an assumption that becomes necessary is that religions and cultures are\xa0not competitors\xa0against each other, but this assumption was not even acknowledged by her, much less proven.\n\nSince Christianity has a public strategy to aggressively “harvest Hindu souls” and has allocated several billions of dollars of budget to accomplish this, and since Christianity fields a massive sales force with quantitative measures of performance (such as dollars per conversion achieved), it seems facile for academic scholars of RISA to ignore the reality of competition.\n\nOnce the competition between religions – which is a Christian mandate and independent of whether Hindus want to compete or not – is put on the academic table for examination, the impact of appropriating symbols/techniques from the other while denigrating the other at the same time is too central to be dismissed simply as a matter of whether the thief did his deed with “sincere feelings.”\n\nOriginal article - [https://rajivmalhotra.com/library/articles/risa-lila-2-limp-scholarship-demonology/](https://rajivmalhotra.com/library/articles/risa-lila-2-limp-scholarship-demonology/)'<br />Author: 'Archer_Arjun'  id: 'ammzoq'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ammzoq/excerpt_from_risa_lila_2_limp_scholarship_and/</li>

So after a few days of mulling, we've decided to move back sometime around September.\n\nHowever, one of my main concerns is my career. Currently I work as a quantitative researcher at a hedge fund, and worked as a software engineer previously. The thing I'm worried about is my salary. I currently earn ~5 crore INR per annum, but from what I've heard, engineers in India don't typically earn more than a couple of lakhs per month. Is that true, or is it possible to earn more working in specific areas (e.g. finance), or if you have significant experience?\n\nI'm young enough to venture into a new field, even if it requires some more education.

I have made it clear that I have no interest in her but she persists. \n\nThe other is the same as above, only she is more attractive but extremely boring and not in synch with my interests. Can't tell her no. \n\nThe third is the case where I really need help, she is of the body type I like, we even hooked up and I stayed at her place for a day but I realized that and and I have nothing in common. The day I spent there, the whole time we were on our phones or watching Netflix. I later on said I have a meeting and escaped. The problem is, i think she thinks that we had something (when I make it explicitly clear that i am not looking for a LTR with all my dates), and now she sent me a photo of her tickets! She has booked tickets to Mumbai, hotel stay (at an expensive hotel, so it's a lot of moolah) and said she misses me a lot? Wtf! I have tried to tell her that she doesn't have to do this but she insists, I told her I have my budget meetings and can't make it and she still insists.... Am now in a pickle. I really am not upto it, but she won't take no for an answer. \n\nHave always had this problem, my Tinder and Bumble have a lot of women who I have met once or twice in the past and haven't unmatched (because I don't want to give them offense) and we all keep in desultory touch. \n\nHow do you say no without hurting someone? \n\nTo clarify on the fat person, am not judgemental at all, if they choose to be fat, so be it, but it is not my body type. Didn't want to cause any offense here and project myself as some fat shamer. Not my intention at all.

He is senior leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, masterminded the Pathankot attack'<br />Body: '# Release of Shahid Latif and 20 other Terrorists by the Cong Led Govt\n\nShahid Latif, 47, who was released from an Indian prison in 2010 by the  previous government, allegedly provided **logistical and other support for  the four Pakistanis who went on to attack the Pathankot base.**\n\nTo improve relations with Pakistan, Latif was deported by the  Congress-led government six years ago, along with nearly 20 other  terrorists who returned home through the Wagah border in Punjab. "All  those released had served their full term in Indian jails and couldn\'t  have been kept back," said a senior source in the National Investigation  Agency or NIA, the country\'s top counter-terror body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Pathankot attack\n\nSeven  military personnel were killed in a siege that lasted a grueling 72  hours. The four terrorists were shot and recently buried in Punjab after  Pakistan refused to accept their bodies.\n\nLatif, who is from Pakistan, was arrested in 1996 from Jammu in a case  related to narcotics and terrorism. He is a senior leader of the  Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, masterminded the Pathankot attack, according to India. \xa0\n\nIn 1999, when Indian Airlines plane IC814 was hijacked by five armed men  to Kandahar in Afghanistan, Latif was among the men whose release was  unsuccessfully demanded by the terrorists. Masood Azhar, who would go on  to found the Jaish-e-Mohammed, was freed along with two others in  exchange for the 189 passengers and crew who were caught in a hostage  situation that lasted nearly a week.\n\nAfter India accused the Jaish of January\'s Pathankot attack, a team of Pakistanis visited India  to scrtunizie the evidence and question witnesses. Amid much criticism  from the opposition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi allowed them onto the  Pathankot base. Pakistan, however, has yet to approve a visit by  investigators of the National Investigation Agency or NIA, the top  counter-terror agency.\n\n# Role Of Shahid Latif\n\nThis 41-year-old terrorist is from Gujranwala, Pakistan. Shahid Latif  was the other important handler of the four terrorists, who sneaked  into the Pathankot Air Force station.\n\nShahid Latif is known as the launching commander of JeM. He had motivated and sent down the four JeM terrorists to Pathankot.\n\nSitting in Pakistan, Latif also coordinated with them before and during the terror attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWas it that difficult for the Congress government to keep Shahid Latif in India based on terror charges of 1993 and other terrorism acts in JK and Narcotics trade in JK he was involved in ?\n\nHis release along with 20 others was a big fatal mistake, he went on to master mind the Pathankot attack. What more are we expecting from the other 20 released ? Was National security thrown out of the window again during the Congress tenure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pak-terrorist-released-by-previous-government-struck-back-with-pathankot-1407168***](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pak-terrorist-released-by-previous-government-struck-back-with-pathankot-1407168)\n\n[***https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nia-pathankot-terrorists-mastermind-handlers-358373-2016-12-19***](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nia-pathankot-terrorists-mastermind-handlers-358373-2016-12-19)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'alsxme'<br />Score:154<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/alsxme/shahid_latif_was_arrested_in_india_in_1993_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Teach Me Thursday : Prosody in Indian Texts and how it changed the world.'<br />Body: '&gt; Disclaimer 1 : I am not an expert. I learnt all this empirically by sifting through scriptures, writing code to study patterns, etc. So, I might digress from usual terminology. \n\n## What is Prosody ? \n\nFirst of all, let\'s just forget the word prosody for a while, a word of that exotic weight scares me. Chhanda, let us just remember this word for a while. \n\nWhat is a Chhanda ?\n\nChhanda is the scheme in which you write a mantra or a shloka or a song. In English, we call it meter. It is a system of setting the lyrics \nright. Hence, in Chhandah-Shastra, the smallest unit to be considered is a syllable instead of a consonant/vowel. The syllable is called Akshara. \n\nLet us just take a simple example : \n\n❁ धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः | मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय || ❁\n\nThis is the first shloka of Bhagavad Geeta. \n\nNow, what is its scheme. Let us find. \n\nIf we look closely, the shloka can easily been seen in two parts. Separated by a separator in the middle. Let us just explode this whole shloka into its constituent syllables. \n\nधर् - मक् - षेत् -रे  ...  कु - रुक् - षेत् - रे .... स - म - वे - ता ... यु - युत् - स - वः |  मा - म - काः - पाण् ... ड - वाश् - चै - व ...कि - म - कुर् - व ... त - सञ् - ज - य ||\n\nAs one can see, the shloka has a total of 32 syllables. Both the lines exactly 16 syllables. \n\nI have also divided each line into 4 parts each containing 4 syllables. But this division clearly is not impressive. As some of the words like पाण् ... ड - व are occuring in separate parts. So, let us divided each line into 2 parts.\n\n(1) धर् - मक् - षेत् -रे - कु - रुक् - षेत् - रे ..(2).. स - म - वे - ता - यु - युत् - स - वः | (3)  मा - म - काः - पाण् - ड - वाश् - चै - व .(4).. कि - म - कुर् - व - त - सञ् - ज - य ||\n\n4 parts, each containing 8 syllables. This scheme is popularly known as Anushtubh Chhanda. It is one of the most popular chhandas in the scriptures. Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata is chiefly written in this scheme. \n\n##Why Chhandas ?\n\nBecause  Chhandas can blend any verbal information in a rhythm. Rhythmic patterns make information memorizable. How can I say this ? Do I have any "scientific" proof ?. Well, the great Indian oral tradition is the proof. It is not like they didn\'t try out other methods of memorization. They must have tried every trick in the world to get the whole thing right. But structured singing schemes, or Chhandas were the best way it seems. \n\nChhandas are of absolute importance to a culture like ours. A culture like ours, where tons of "scriptures" were passed orally, it is inevitable that we develop a clean system around how we form shlokas and sing them.\n\nA scripture like Mahabharata has around 1 lakh shlokas. To maintain uniformity of such a huge scale, that too, across thousands of ashrams sprawling across the country of thousand languages and accents. A system needed to be invented, or rather discovered, that would keep in continuity such texts of antiquity. \n\nMusic as we know works in 8 bars. At least that\'s what dancers know, 5 6 7 8, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and so on. The whole act of dance is divided into these nicely defined series of 8 "beats", we call them "bars".  Each bar in music contains 8 beats. It is now obvious, why Anshtubh Chhanda is set in a scheme of 8 syllables x 4 . It means that the whole shloka would be complete in exactly 4 bars. Now, one can play santoor, sitar, veena, shehnai in sync to it. One can dance to it. \n\nThat\'s the reason why it is called GEETA (literally song) and not lecture. \n\nLet us take the case of Savitri mantra, popularly known as Gayatri mantra, the crown jewel of all mantras is written in a chhanda called Gayatri. \n\nThe first verse of RigVeda is written in Gayatri chhanda. \n\n❁ अ॒ग्निमी॑ळे पु॒रोहि॑तं य॒ज्ञस्य॑ दे॒वमृ॒त्विजं॑ | होता॑रं रत्न॒धात॑मं ❁\n\nGayatri has 24 syllables. These are neatly divided into 3 parts of 8 syllables each. \n\nअ॒ग्निमी॑ळे पु॒रोहि॑तं (8) | य॒ज्ञस्य॑ दे॒वमृ॒त्विजं॑  (8) | होता॑रं रत्न॒धात॑मं (8) \n\nLooking at the famous Gayatri mantra itself. \n\nतत्स॑वि॒तुर्वरेण्यं॒  (7) | भर्गो॑ दे॒वस्य॑धीमहि  (8) । धियो॒ यो नः॑ प्रचो॒दया॑त् ॥ (8)\n\nThe above mantra is appended with ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः. to form Gayatri mantra.\n\nBut you may notice that the above form, doesn\'t have 24 but 23 syllables. \n\nThat is because, the actual Gayatri verse, was somewhat like this :\n\nतत्स॑वि॒तुर्वरेणियं (8) | भर्गो॑ दे॒वस्य॑धीमहि  (8) । धियो॒ यो नः॑ प्रचो॒दया॑त् ॥ (8)\n\nThen, why was it made to seven, that should ideally throw it out of the musical scheme. NO. In fact, after the appending of ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः. It falls into a new scheme of mantras we call the Ushnih chhanda. Ushnih Chhanda has 2 sets of 8 syllables and 1 single line of 12 syllables. Thus taking the total to 28 syllables. \n\n ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः तत्स॑वि॒तुर्वरेण्यं॒ (12) | भर्गो॑ दे॒वस्य॑धीमहि (8) । धियो॒ यो नः॑ प्रचो॒दया॑त् ॥ (8)\n\nSee, this is the exact way we sing this mantra. \n\n##Who did this all structuring ? \n\nThere are several varieties of Chhandas in Vedas, Upanishads and other texts. Rarely does one find a piece of Sanskrit literature which is not in a chhanda. Hence, it is the work of countless saints and their disciples. They must have started a bit shaky, they would have devised experimental chhandas. But Kala, the biggest distiller refined the best. Thus those that survived were the most rhythmic. \n\nBut all this Chhandas.. had to give the world more than it intended. It gave the world, a world full of maths.\n\nThe most legit work on Chhandas was done by Pingala (4th century BCE), in the form of ChhandaShastra. But Pingala (often called as brother of Panini) was no usual Samaveda learner. He started abstracting "maths" out of these patterns. It is his work with syllables, that would later translate into Hemachandra series (Fibonacci Series), recursion, combinatorics, pascal triangle and many many other interesting mathematical discoveries. \n\nLet us just take an example of Hemachandra\'s question. This one is explained wonderfully by Manjula Bharagava (Fields Medal winner) in a youtube video.\n\nHemachandra asked -- In how many ways can we feel the 8 beats of a bar ? Given that, we have syllables taking space equal to 1 beat, called Laghu and syllables that would take space equal to 2 beats called Dirgha.\n\nOne way is  1 + 1 + 1... 8 times. \n\nOther way is  2 + 2 + 2 + 2  = 8 \n\nAnother way is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8 ..\n\nThere can be many ways. But his assertion and solution is quite interesting he says. \n\n-- The last syllable would either be 1 or 2.\n\nThat\'s it. That\'s what he says. But this is enough for the solution. How ??\n\nIf the last syllable is 1. The number of ways would be equal to number of ways we can fill 7 beats.\n\nIf the last syllable is 2. The number of ways would be equal to number of ways we can fill 6 beats.\n\nThus, No. of ways_8_beats = No. of ways_6_beats + No. of ways_7_beats\n\nGoing by the exact same logic.\n\nNo. of ways_7_beats = No. of ways_6_beats + No. of ways_5_beats\n\nPutting it in the modern functional format. \n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)  .. f(0)= 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2\n\nThis is popularly known as Fibonacci Series. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are many variations within Chhandas too, that mainly comes from how the short and long syllables are arranged within the shloka. If anybody wants to know more about the subject, you can PM me. But more importantly, what I wanted to illustrate with this post was how rich and interesting our culture is. How seemingly unrelated subjects give rise to each other.

Every year the security forces kill 150-200 terrorists. Next year, again we have a similar number joining ranks; the throughput in the system remains the same. \n\nWe are killing terrorists, not terrorism. \n\nI recently spent time with the Commanding Officer of 19 Rashtriya Rifles, in South Kashmir. He is that typical breed of young infantry COs of the Indian Army; aggressive, decisive and wise beyond their years. He said something to me that will stay with me for a long time. \n\n“I am responsible not just to the men under my command, but also to their families. Death of even one of my men is simply not acceptable to me, but I understand that defending the nation comes at a cost. So, I drive my men and myself to train in the freezing cold, day in and day out, without respite, for those 5 seconds of reckoning. When they come face to face with the enemies of the nation, they must win. In this game, there is no silver medal; its either gold, or death”.\n\nAs I travel through the breadth of South Kashmir, the hotbed of separatism and terror, I encounter a recurring sight; young Kashmiri men walking with their heads bowed, staring at a smartphone. Are they any different form young men around the world? Not really, except the content that most of them consume. Call it pure, unadulterated poison.\n\nThe Kashmir Valley is being radicalized at a furious pace. There are more than five hundred madrasas in Anantnag alone, unmonitored and free to decide what they will teach to the impressionable young. Thousands of such madrasas dot the landscape across Kashmir. In many such schools of religious learning, the teachers are no longer Kashmiris. They are from Deoband and they owe fealty to Jamaat-i-Islami. In these madrasas, the glory of Jihad is taught to children as young as five years old.\n\nSmartphones in Kashmir have content that is shocking, and we have no strategy to counter it. If we say we do, we are lying. WhatsApp groups are used not just to gather stone pelters at the site of an encounter, but also to warn terrorists of movement of security forces. There are young men always close by, walking and watching. If they see an army convoy leaving the gates of an army camp, the message is broadcast immediately – number of vehicles, direction of movement and estimated number of troops.\n\nFake Twitter handles and Facebook pages are created by the thousands, backed by Pakistan’s ISI. Blogs, Vlogs, music, videos, and literature…it is an entire industry set up to poison the Kashmiri mind, and it is high-volume, high-quality, professional content. ISPR (Inter Services Public Relations), the PR wing of the Pakistani Armed Forces is the mother of this e-Jihad. And the poisonous content they create lands up on the smartphone of the young of Kashmir. Mass scale brainwashing is happening right under our noses.\n\nWhen I was posted in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, encounters with foreign terrorists were common. Afghans, Sudanese and Pakistanis were some nationalities that came to India to seek heaven. They raped Kashmiri women, killed with impunity and roamed the streets with abandon. The Indian Army responded by setting up anti-infiltration grids. Over a period of time, the deluge of foreign terrorists became a trickle. An odd Pakistani still manages to sneak in, but the majority of terrorists in Kashmir are locals.\n\nPakistan has ensured that it no longer need export terror to India. Pakistan radicalizes the young of Kashmir in the name of jihad. These young men join the ranks of terror organizations.  Just so that they don’t have second thoughts, their pictures are taken with weapons and circulated on social media. Once security forces get these pictures, these men are marked. Once they die in an encounter with security forces, huge funerals are organized. These funerals are actually recruitment rallies. Terror has been outsourced to the victim of terror.\n\nThis entire environment ensures that there is always a steady stream of terrorists in Kashmir, home grown and able to melt into their surroundings. This also gives Pakistan plausible deniability. They can hence rightfully claim that the “freedom struggle” in Kashmir is indigenous. \n\nAs I said, the throughput in the system remains the same. Checkmate.\n\nInformation Warfare (IW) must be recognized as a weapon of war. It is. Yet, it is not. IW is a halfhearted push, even in the army. We don’t seem to realize that the enemy is in the mind, not on the ground. Killing terrorists will not solve the problem. Getting all mushy with the locals will not solve the problem, either.\n\nSocial media is the cause of the majority of problems we are facing in Kashmir. We should have been able to counter it long back. We didn’t. Here is a roadmap that will tell anyone in position of authority and willing to listen, how this can be done.\n\nWhat is urgently required is a fully secure building in NCR Delhi, staffed by army officers at the top echelons. Lets call this building, the BLUE BOX. The top ‘management’ of this Blue Box must be wafer thin. The rest of the team, thousands of them, will be civilians, with the mean age not exceeding 25 years. We need content writers, videographers, special effects experts, video editors, hackers, social media experts, research scholars, experts in Islamic theology, linguists, songwriters and musicians, all under the same roof. In that building, we need a recording studio, server rooms, IT hardware, software, high speed Internet and all equipment related to content creation and social media. We need Kashmiri Muslim men and women working for us. Yes, there are thousands of them who put their lives on the line each day to tell India’s story. We must mobilize them.\n\nAll these professionals should be paid well, and made to sign NDAs. Thousands of Twitter handles, Facebook profiles, Instagram accounts, blogs, Vlogs, websites and WhatsApp groups need to be created, a veritable firestorm of pro-India content.\n\nThere must be action at multiple levels. Creation of content to counter malicious propaganda, creation of content to push our own narrative and ‘managing’ local Kashmiri media are the three immediate challenges.\n\nIW must percolate down to the Rashtriya Rifles Sector level. It is important for the Sector Commanders to have their own IW team of professionals (civilians included), which is directly plugged into IW of Victor Force and Kilo Force. These must, in turn, be plugged into the IW cells of XV Corps, Northern Command and ADGPI. It is also essential to post a qualified IW officer at the RR battalion level. He may not generate IW content directly, but most information will pass through him. Information Warfare is both top down and bottom up. A simple top down approach can be detrimental because when it comes to social media use, both information and content are mostly generated at the ground level. \n\nThe need of the hour is to go on a massive media and social media offensive. It is important to flood Kashmir with a counter narrative.\n\nRR Battalion and Sector Commanders must have the independence to deal with local and national media. The reasons are valid. It is not difficult to imagine a Tamil journalist living and reporting from New Delhi, or a Bengali reporting from Gujarat. The only limiting factor is language. Kashmir’s story is different. You have to be a Kashmiri to be able to stay in and report from the Valley. I am sure there is the possibility of a rare exception, but I am not aware of any. Indian journalists from outside the Kashmir Valley are just too afraid of being harmed or even killed, if they live and report from Srinagar. That fear is not without reason. Here, I speak about the national media, both print and electronic. \n\nThe local Kashmiri media is another kettle of fish. Hiding behind the façade of freedom of expression, it deals in rumors, insinuation and lies. While Indian media is known to be a little elastic with the truth, local Kashmiri media often behaves like the propaganda wing of the Hurriyat. I wouldn’t be surprised if individual reporters are on Pakistan’s payroll. Look at it from the ISI’s perspective. It makes perfect sense.\n\nPrivate Kashmiri TV channels are an urgent requirement. DD Kashir is a dead duck. Private FM Channels should become a part of Kashmiri life. Both audio and video content must be beamed live across the Valley. Much of it must be web-based. Newspapers in Kashmiri and Urdu should be launched that tell our story. Distribute them free of cost, if we must. And all this should be plugged in to the Blue Box.\n\nWe simply have to find a way to communicate with Kashmiris through TV, print, radio, web and social media. There is no other road.\n\nMassive infusion of funds is needed in the education system in Kashmir. Madrasas funded by Jamaat-i-Islami must be shut down and replaced with schools with a sensible, modern curriculum. Lets not get all touchy feely about this. The cost of our ‘liberal’ outlook is borne by soldiers. \n\nThis madness, which pervades Kashmir, is a mental illness. This madness will not go away, unless we attack its foundation. The foundation is in the mind.\n\nWe have been a careless nation. We have allowed this madness to spread in Kashmir, madness seemingly without end. But end, it must. The Blue Box is no longer a luxury. It is a question of survival.\n\nMinistries and departments cannot run the Blue Box. It cannot be run by intelligence agencies. They simply don’t have the capability or the understanding. Teenagers and young adults, mavericks who don’t follow the rules, must run the Blue Box. And the army must supervise this operation.\n\nIt is time to call in the Indian Army once more. The only difference will be that this time, the laptop will replace the AK 47. It calls for a mindset change, a revolution in the army’s way of thinking. But history is witness that there is no student more willing than the Indian Army. Why involve the army, some would ask. Well, the Indian Army is the only institution that has men on ground and can get the job done. No excuses, no stories, no delays. \n\nThe Blue Box is what the Indian Army urgently needs in Kashmir. It has enough weapons, bulletproof jackets and helmets. There is no dearth of such equipment. But you cannot kill an idea, however poisonous, with an AK 47. Only an idea can kill an idea.\n\nIf we create the Blue Box, over time the throughput in the system will cease to exist. And Pakistan will face it biggest defeat since 1971.\n\n#TheOtherWar #adgpi #MajorGauravArya'<br />Author: 'prasad_knew'  id: 'alm3vq'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/alm3vq/the_other_war/</li>

A US environmental organisation named its centre after her.'<br />Body: "# State Government's Promise\n\n107-year-old Saalumarada Thimmakka, this year’s **Padma Shri award** winner,  is happy with the national recognition. But she is upset with the state  government for not recognising her green crusade. Though the state  government has given her many awards and named a few green schemes after  her, Thimmakka is provided with just Rs 500 per month from the  government as old-age pension.\n\nThe state government had also assured to give her Rs 2 crore cash and  a piece of land for her livelihood, but she has not got them till now.  “Thimmakka is disappointed by the attitude of the state government and  stopped taking the pension for the last one year,’’ Umesh, her adopted  son, said. They are managing with the cash awards she gets from private  organisations who felicitate her at various events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# I cannot eat mementos\n\nDespite her conservation efforts, she has been living a life of near  penury.\xa0 Thimmakka laments that her frequent pleas have fallen on deaf  ears. Her house is filled with mementos and little else. When contacted  on Saturday, she said, “I cannot eat mementos.’’\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Son of Kharge\n\nPriyank Kharge, Social Welfare Minister, told TNSE that he would take  up the issue with Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy. “We will take a call  on what facilities can be extended to improve the livelihood of the  Padma Shri award winner,” he added.\n\nFondly referred to as Tree Woman, Thimmakka’s love for trees dates  back to several decades. When they remained childless even after many  years of marriage, Thimmakka and her husband Chikkaiah started planting  banyan saplings and nurtured them as their own children. The duo would  walk this stretch to water the plants during summer, a practice  Thimmakka continued after her husband’s death in 1991. Today there are  385 banyan trees on a 4km stretch between Hulikal and Kudur in Magadi  taluk of Ramanagara district, thanks to Thimmakka’s efforts. \xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Recognition by BBC and US\n\nThimmakka is known globally too.

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] US-Taliban deal, big Brexit defeat, and heat wave in Australia'<br />Body: "Welcome to this week's edition of the Geopolitics Thread! Here, you can discuss the latest happenings from around the world - sports, movies, politics, and much more! Topics *do not* have to be related to India, you can discuss any interesting development you've come across. To get things started, here are some big stories:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India's neighbourhood\n\n1. [US and Taliban said to reach peace deal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-draft/foreign-troops-to-quit-afghanistan-in-18-months-under-draft-deal-taliban-sources-idUSKCN1PK0DG)\n\nAccording to Reuters and NYT,  U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and representatives of the Afghan Taliban have concluded a draft peace deal that basically involves the US withdrawing its forces from the country in 18 months, and the Taliban promising to prevent terrorist activities against the US and its allies there. This most certainly means Taliban involvement in a future Afghan government, although details are unknown. Notably, the negotiations took place without any representative from the Afghan government, and it is widely believed that Pakistan played a big role in facilitating it, although formal talks took place in Qatar. Now, Khalilzad is looking to sell the deal in Kabul. \n\n2. [Asia Bibi appeal to begin in Pakistan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistani-lawyer-returns-home-to-defend-christian-woman/2019/01/28/e144d206-22c6-11e9-b5b4-1d18dfb7b084_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.4cfd08fba671)\n\nThe appeal against the acquittal of Christian woman Asia Bibi, who has been accused of blasphemy but was previously found innocent by the Supreme Court, is all set to begin on Tuesday, with her lawyer having returned to the country after fleeing mass protests that threatened his life. The hardline group that is pushing for Bibi to be executed is somewhat weakened this time, with its leadership behind bars for violent protests after the acquittal. Nonetheless, the group has vowed to reject anything but her execution. If acquitted again, Bibi will be free to assume asylum in Canada, where her daughters have already moved. \n\n3. [Thailand (finally) announces an election date](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/asia/thailand-election-date-intl/index.html)\n\nAfter five years of military rule, Thailand is set to elect a democratic government after the last one was ousted in a coup. The election is scheduled for March 24 after it was approved by the king. The last election was 8 years ago, after which  former army Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha seized power in a military coup in 2014, following six months of street protests and the removal of former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra.  However, Shinawatra's party remains popular and could win in March. Still, the election will be held under a military-imposed 2017 constitution (the **20th** since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932), which allows the military to have a significant say in the government, including appointing all 250 MPs in the upper house, the Senate.\n\n# Top 3 stories from the world\n\n1. [Trump blinks, US partial government shutdown ends for 3 weeks](https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1zbmJjLmNvbS9hbS1qb3kvd2F0Y2gvZ292ZXJubWVudC1vcGVucy10ZW1wb3JhcmlseS1hZnRlci1sb25nZXN0LXNodXRkb3duLWluLXUtcy1oaXN0b3J5LTE0MzI0OTEwNzU2MjjSAQA?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen)\n\nThe longest shutdown in the history of the US government ended when US President Donald Trump agreed to a temporary 3 week spending bill, including back-pay for federal employees who were forced to work without pay. In the meantime, he has demanded that Democrats and Republicans present him with a plan that includes funding for his border wall. He has previously threatened to declare a national emergency on the US-Mexico border and fund the wall without legislative approval. Trump's move came after several flights at New York City's LaGuardia airport were delayed, leading to cascading delays in other major hubs, due to a large number of air traffic controllers calling in sick. Industry groups feared a dangerous level of cancellations that could disrupt the economy. \n\n2. [Brexit deal defeated in UK Parliament, now what?](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-47035028/what-next-for-brexit)\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May's government suffered the biggest legislative defeat in the history of the House of Commons as MPs rejected her Brexit deal, although May herself survived a vote of no confidence pushed by the opposition Labour Party. Now, May's government has to deal with MPs, who have a variety of suggestions ranging from staying in an EU customs union to just staying in the EU. These suggestions are in the form of amendments to the deal, which would have to be first approved by the EU and then approved by Parliament in a final vote. The EU has previously indicated that it is in no mood to give in to any more demands from the UK.\n\n3. [Record heat wave in Australia disrupts power](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/australia-s-heatwave-triggers-power-outages-as-fires-rage-1.3770398)\n\nMany cities in Australia are going through a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures soaring to about 47C in some areas for several consecutive days. Melbourne recorded a high temperature of about 43C on Jan 24, which sent electricity demand soaring and eventually led to power cuts that lasted as long as 2 hours in some areas. Meanwhile, the southern island-state of Tasmania is battling over 50 wildfires that have ignited in the sweltering heat there, leading to several planned evacuations and declining air quality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShare any other interesting stories you found with the sub!\n\n वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् "<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'akuseq'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/akuseq/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_ustaliban_deal_big/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The biggest achievement of the current government is 5 years of low inflation.'<br />Body: "India has been a high inflation country for most of its existence. High inflation is a tax on people who have a major part of their money in cash or banks. And who are the people who keep a major part of their money in cash or FDs and savings account? Poor and middle class people. Most of the rich have their money in property and stocks. They have big loans and when it comes to rupee they have more loans than the cash in hand. Higher inflation makes it easier to pay back interests because the effective interest rate becomes much lower or even negative. Similarly when the inflation is 10%, as was the case during UPA-2, and the FD interest rate is 8% you are basically being taxed by the banks and government for keeping cash.\n\nOn the other hand industrialists with thousands of crores of loans save a lot and are able to pay back the loans much more easily. Some of the inflation tax goes to government but a lot of it goes to the industrialists. However, during last 5 years we have seen manageable inflation rate. It has almost always been in the target range of 3-5% targeted by RBI. I remember when most of my colleagues got an 8% raise in 2013-14 FY and basically our purchasing power had gone down but my boss wouldn't really care about Economics. As per him we got a decent raise. The prices in the company cafeteria had gone up by around 10% across the board because of the same inflation.\n\nLast 5 years have been peaceful and I am afraid that if there is a change in the government we will go back to high inflation rate and negative real salary raises and negative real interest rates."<br />Author: 'ruppanbabu'  id: 'akojlx'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/akojlx/the_biggest_achievement_of_the_current_government/</li>

Sen and Dharam Bir Sinha) lifted off from Lucknow airport at 5.45 p.m.  on the last leg of its journey from Calcutta to Delhi.\n\nNone of the  passengers took any notice of the two young men who rose from their  seats in the 15th row and moved casually towards the cockpit 15 minutes  before the aircraft was due to touch down at Delhi\'s Palam Airport. The  bearded member of the duo, listed on the passenger manifest as Bhola  Nath Pandey, politely asked the flight purser, G.V. Dey, if they could  visit the cockpit. Dey said he would communicate their request to the  captain, M.N. Battiwala.\n\n \n\nAs Dey was about to enter the cockpit, one of the men grabbed  airhostess Indira Thakuri\'s elbow while his companion tried to force his  way into the cockpit. However, the self-locking mechanism on the  magnetic door of the cockpit clicked into place. Undeterred, the two men  threw their weight against the door until it flew open, and disappeared  inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy now, the passengers and cabin crew had realized that something was  amiss, "As expected," stated Lemkit Foning, 27, the flight\'s second  airhostess, "the commander\'s first announcement came over the public  address system within minutes, saying that we had been hijacked and were  flying to Patna. A few seconds later, his second announcement informed  us that we were headed for Varanasi instead."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Their Demands\n\nThe hijackers, however, were in no mood for frivolity and immediately  started delivering impassioned speeches in Hindi dwelling on Indira  Gandhi\'s arrest the day before and the "vindictiveness" of the Janata  Party. They proclaimed themselves as Youth Congress(I) members (a claim  that has since been denied by Congress(I) leaders) and stated that they  were "Gandhians" and "non-violent" and had no desire to harm the  passengers.\n\nThe speech was interspersed with cries of "Indira  zindabad" and "Sanjay zindabad". A section of the passengers even  applauded the speech when it ended, though there were catcalls as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Congress Party\'s Reward to the Hijackers\n\n Congress party rewarded them with party tickets for 1980 state assembly election.\n\n **Both won the election and became members of the legislative assembly of** **Uttar Pradesh****.  Bhola served as a Congress MLA from 1980 to 1985 and 1989 to 1991 from  Doaba, Ballia also Devendra remained a member of the house for two  terms.** \n\n**Devendra served the party as a general secretary of Uttar Pradesh until recently**. He is now nurturing the **Sultanpur**  constituency in the hope of a Congress ticket in the next elections. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBhola pandey also became **general secretary of Indian youth congress and  secretary of Indian National Congress.**  He belongs to Ballia. Bhola Pandey unsuccessfully contested the 1991,1996, 1999, 2004, 2009  and 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Salempur as a Congress candidate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA terrorist act of hijacking a plane carrying 132 passengers , breaking open the cockpit door all this done carrying a toy gun and a cricket ball. What did the Congress party do to them rewarded not only in 1980 but as late as recently. One of them is hoping for Congress ticket to fight the next elections. This is how Congress rewards their ecosystems and supporters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bholanath\\_and\\_Devendra\\_Pandey***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bholanath_and_Devendra_Pandey)\n\n[***https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tale-of-two-hijackers-One-is-Congress-candidate-other-most-wanted/articleshow/33156540.cms***](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tale-of-two-hijackers-One-is-Congress-candidate-other-most-wanted/articleshow/33156540.cms)\n\n[***https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19790115-indian-airlines-boeing-737-hijacking-a-black-political-comedy-821765-2014-12-09***](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/19790115-indian-airlines-boeing-737-hijacking-a-black-political-comedy-821765-2014-12-09)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'akmgd2'<br />Score:302<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/akmgd2/in_1978_bholanath_pandey_and_devendra_pandey/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Western meddling in other countries - a close look at how it happens'<br />Body: 'Russia Today has been doing a great job in covering the way the British government (and NATO) essentially use the media and NGOs to advance their strategic interests under a project called the "Integrity Initiative". \n\nMuch of their findings are sourced DIRECTLY from the leaks, and they are credible - as the Integrity Initiative\'s website immediately locked itself and wiped it\'s database clean following the leaks. \n\nHere\'s a new leak covered in an article:\n\n[https://www.rt.com/news/449848-integrity-initiative-muslims-nato-nuclear/](https://www.rt.com/news/449848-integrity-initiative-muslims-nato-nuclear/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe plan is very clear:\n\n1. Use people from the private sector ("patriots") and take advantage of their expertise. \n2. Identify communities to be targeted with certain messages - in this case, making the muslim community pro-NATO. \n3. Use NGOs on the ground and brief them on how to maintain "legal" status. \n\nIt\'s amazing how well- coordinated this is. These parts were particularly interesting:\n\n \n\n&gt;Among the dozens of “patriots” listed in the leak are Ian Cohen,  managing director at HSBC Global Asset Management, Phil Jolley, *“executive partner at IBM and the UK national lead on ‘Blockchain’ technologies”* and start-up adviser Ren Kapoor, MBE, whose mission within “the project” is *“to  provide advice and training to NGOs on budgeting, legal compliance and a  range of issues with which they need to comply in order to remain legal  and to survive financially.”*\n\n \n\n&gt;Here is the problem, as described by the author of a background paper from the Why NATO matters *“educational”* project.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*“NATO’s  involvement in Muslim majority countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,  is interpreted by the vast majority of Muslims as NATO’s simply being  hostile to Islam and Muslims per se,”* says the author, partially putting such qualms down to *“ignorance.”*  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead, the author says, Muslims, particularly young representatives  from the UK’s ethnic minorities, who are already considered *“problematic,”* should be taught about\xa0*“NATO  as an international intervention body that engages to prevent wars and  conflicts and plays an important role in mediation and to bring lasting  peace.”*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*“People will be encouraged to talk to their friends and families  about their understanding of NATO’s role in global conflicts, including  humanitarian aid in natural disaster zones,”*\xa0the author states.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The paper suggests that the influencing effort is already underway, but appeals for the creation of a *“well-resourced programme”* that will bring about *“a long-term appreciation of NATO.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts reasonable to assume that if they\'re willing to use these tactics in their own country and abroad, they\'ll definitely be doing the same thing in India. In fact, in India, it would be easier, because they have wiling accomplices. \n\nIf we\'re seeing a renewed coordination in the Congress\' party\'s strategy, i think its clear where it originates from. Nobody in the congress party - or in india - has the brains to put together such a strategy - i\'ll bet money that the new-found "media" and targeted messaging is coming from elsewhere. \n\nThe NGOs and the churches are part of the same machinery. NGOs (who have been raided recently) influence the laws and the governance, while churches are meant to reduce the number of hindus in politically significant states. The NGOs will protect the churches, and as stated above - they are well advised on how to maintain their legality. \n\nThey have their fighters in the secularist media, who often follow the western media\'s lead in how to report and cover India\'s political issues. Social media was largely untouched, but now we\'re seeing targeted campaigns against pro-BJP accounts. \n\nAs i have explained in previous posts, the western world - specifically america and britain - desperately needs the Modi government out of power. They are the ones that have every incentive to pull the strings in order to put a friendlier, and more deferential congress party in charge.

      <li>Title::: 'Manikarnika an exercise in tedium'<br />Body: "The movie follows standard Telugu / Tamil mass masala movie tropes, only the mass hero here is Kangana Ranaut. \n\nThere is no script here, nor is there a storyline. Character development of any character, including the titular character is non existent. It's just bad guys doing bad guy things, the good people mouthing platitudes about Jhansi Bai same Jhansi Bai just mouthing homilies and giving gyaan. This is about the entire plot. \n\nA historical character with great complexity -she was first pro British and later turned into one of the tallest leaders of the rebellion- is turned into a comical character from a 70's Chinese martial arts movie. The true depth, that would have made for stirring cinema, from a supporter to a staunch anti British leader is made one dimensional. In the movie, Jhansi Bai is anti British from the time she was an infant almost. \n\nThe battle sequences are never ending and just plain shitty. The hand to hand sequences are shot well though and that's the only saving grace. When the Brits stormed Jhansi, the soldiers of Jhansi fought desperately, house to house, street to street and every inch was gained or lost at the cost of a great amount of blood and this would make for great cinema but the movie just shows random clips, some nonsensical garbage like a cannon mounted on a cart and operated by 2 people! Even the smallest Gribeauval 4 pounder from that period weighed 500 kgs and needed a crew of 4 + a limber team of 3 horses. There is no cogent tactics deployed, artillery fire randomly, a British Major General leads a charge, cavalry March ahead of Infantry and there is no infantry to speak of in the first place. It's a terrible mess all around and the thing is, real history depicted well has great great cinematic merit. Picture a line infantry battle (think some scene from The Patriot) as happened in 1857. Lines of men slaughtering each other, cannon balls blowing off heads and limbs....makes for great cinema but this movie reduces it to some garbage charges and counter charges. Even the uniforms that would have taken 2 seconds to research, is messed up. The hussars who in real history ended the fight against Jhansi are dressed up like a Turkish bellhop! \n\nEven the broad plot, lends itself to a great movie, like how Jhansi is attacked by 2 Indian states who sense weakness, attack and get defeated or how, when the rebellion began, Lakshmi Bai under the very noses of the British organised a ceremony both bolstering the moral of the citizens and calling the British cowards. \n\nEven the broader picture, we are shown as healthy happy cheerful people when the reality (again makes for powerful cinema) was that India by that time was poor as fuck and it's people robbed and demoralised. Imagine scenes where the Rani goes out and sees the real state of India and this acts as a catalyst that causes her to resist the British occupation? Imagine how powerful a scene this would have been? \n\nA movie with a fucking item number that the Rani joins in? Is something that can't be taken seriously. \n\nThe cinematography and the BGM are brilliant though, Kangana shines through in some scenes but that's about it. \n\nThere is one stirring scene though where the writers clearly thought things through and it pays great dividends. This is when Lakshmi Bai slaughters wave after wave of British soldiers, and pauses, in the background is an image of Kali, bloodthirsty! Brilliant cinema but that scene doesn't make the full movie now does it. \n\nOn the whole, an exercise in tedium.

I believe myself to be naturally inclined towards problem solving - restoring and resolving affected areas. And it's not stressful for me at all. I'm thinking of taking this up as a career option. So, for folks managing or responsible for (software) technology projects, do you think that an external 3rd party help is something you would be willing to pay for?

Mental stability because out here I am constantly thinking about what to do incase my company let's go of me and I have 29 days to find another job or leave the country ( times are tough at the moment ) \n\n 1. No sense of belonging and I genuinely don't want my kids ( when we decide to have kids) to experience the same thing I went through after being born here. My parents came here in the 70s and it was a completely different world back then. \n\n 2. Yes I know there will be some things (like traffic, commute, etc) that will need some getting used to but the thought of being able to plan your life for the long term gets me every time. \n\nHad this thought after a buddy was let go a few months ago and was forced to move back after not finding a suitable job and he couldn't be happier. He has time for a social life and when you're not worrying about visa and all of those added concerns you tend to work better too. \n\nNow I know that every place is different but it helps to know what to expect. \n\nWould love to know if any of you lovely people have made or know someone who made a similar move."<br />Author: 'koraxnj'  id: 'aj8uy7'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aj8uy7/nri_considering_moving_back_to_mumbai/</li>

Yet, less than 10 passengers take this train from Yeshwantpur Junction. Hardly many know of this service , if some thought and work is done, could solve major traffic issues"<br />Body: '# Rs.10 Train that takes you close to 5km from the Kempegowda International Airport\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA DH team had the entire eight-coach Yeshwantpur–Devanahalli DEMU  train virtually to themselves. This ride could help hundreds of  Devanahalli and airport-bound commuters bypass the costly cabs and  congested roads. But the occupancy remains shockingly low. Why?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The main Issues\n\n* The 10.35 am start time will not benefit any office-goer,  whether their workplaces are inside the airport or outside, in  Devanahalli, near Dodjala or beyond. \n* Hardly anyone knows that this train even exists.\n\nThe train\'s coaches have two power cars and six travelling cars,  mostly running empty. South Western Railway (SWR) officials en route to  Devanahalli tried to explain it away: \n\n&gt;"This is a special train operated  only for rake movement. That\'s why passengers are generally low in  numbers."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother reason for the low patronage was this: The train goes only up  to Devanahalli. Extending it to Chikkaballapur will get more  passengers. Currently, only two pairs of trains operate on this route,  one in the morning and another in the evening.\n\nSources revealed that the track occupancy for the 13-km line from  Yeshwantpur Junction to Yelahanka Junction is currently only 50%,  reducing further to 29% from Yelahanka to Chikkaballapur. The message is  clear: Doubling the number of services will not disrupt the existing  train movements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut SWR officials say frequency can be increased only if the  signalling, stations and tracks are upgraded. Currently, stations en  route have no signals but issue tickets. The number of level crossings,  too, will have to be further reduced from the existing six between  Yeshwantpur and Devanahalli. Road overbridges are critical, they say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Shuttle Services\n\nThe Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) is ready to  introduce shuttle buses between a new halt station on this rail route  that passes through the KIA premises, and its terminals.\n\nBut activists ask: Why wait for the halt station? Let those shuttle  buses go right up to the Dodjala station for a nominal charge. It could  be a game-changer for airport commute by rail, saving both money and  time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Is this the failure of Karnataka Govt or the Southern Railways ?\n\nThis could solve so much major traffic problems and congestion on this busy route. Currently KIA has 20K employees and this will increase with additional of the new terminal.\n\nJust 2 trains on this route and also slower but compared to the average time taken to reach airport from Yeshwathpur this is a feasible service.\n\nThey could have shuttle services from the Dodjala station to KIA or have cab services this might also benefit the regional area around providing employment opportunities to a few hundreds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n[***https://www.deccanherald.com/city/rs-10-airport-train-ride-no-714255.html***](https://www.deccanherald.com/city/rs-10-airport-train-ride-no-714255.html)\n\nUncluttered link - [https://outline.com/f94gZr](https://outline.com/f94gZr)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'aiq80d'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aiq80d/a_rs_10_train_ticket_can_take_you_within_five/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Uttarakhand court ordered Ganga , Yamuna status of living human entities, SC in a 1969 judgement that Hindu deities can be taxed as per Section 2(31) of the Income Tax Act of 1961 “person” was defined including “artificial juridical persons”. Chandrachud says deity has no constitutional rights,T/F?'<br />Body: '# Case of Ganga and Yamuna\n\nIn India, the Ganga river, considered sacred by more than 1 billion  Indians, has become the first non-human entity in India to be granted  the same legal rights as people. A court in Uttarakhand has ordered that  the Ganga and its main tributary, the Yamuna, should be accorded the  status of living human entities. The decision, which was welcomed by  environmentalists, means that polluting or damaging the rivers will be  legally equivalent to harming a person. The judges cited the example of  the Whanganui river in this context. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA New Zealand river revered by the Maori has been recognised by  Parliament as a “legal person”, in a move believed to be the world’s  first. The river has been granted the same legal rights as a human  being.\n\nThe local Maori tribe of Whanganui in the North Island has fought for  the recognition of their river—the third-largest in New Zealand—as an  ancestor for 140 years. Hundreds of tribal representatives wept with joy  when their bid to have their kin awarded legal status as a living  entity was made into law.\n\nAccording to news reports, the reason the locals had taken this  approach was because they had always considered the river as their  ancestor. They were quoted as saying that they fought to find an  approximation in law so that everyone else could understand that  treating the river as a living entity, from their perspective, was the  right way to approach it as opposed to treating it from the perspective  of ownership and management, which had been the traditional model for a  century. The new status accorded to the river meant abusing or harming  it was equivalent to harming the tribe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#  Supreme Court judgement on Sabarimala, which denied any rights to the Deity.  \n\n \n\nThe Travancore covenant signed by Government of India was with Lord  Padmanabhaswamy. This was made clear by the then ruler to V.P. Menon and  Sardar Patel that he was only acting on the behalf of the Deity as His  servant, Padmanabha Dasa.\n\nThe rights and privileges of all such rulers including the Ruler of  all Rulers, Lord Padmanabhaswamy Deity was protected in our Constitution  by the Constituent Assembly, as advised by Sardar Patel in his address  to the Constituent Assembly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Supreme Court, in the famous Privy Purse judgement in 1971  interpreting the Constitutional guarantees given to rulers held that  “The Rulers who were before integration of their States aliens qua the  Dominion Government are now citizens.”\n\nEven though the 26th Amendment to the Constitution removed the  privileges and rights due to all rulers in an immoral act, the Supreme  Court in a 1993 judgement upheld the 26th Amendment of the Constitution,  approving the statement of objects of the amendment as “The distinction  between the erstwhile Rulers and the citizenry of India has to be put  an end to so as to have a common brotherhood.”\n\nPrior to the 26th amendment of the Constitution, only Lord  Padmanabhaswamy Deity, who was the ruler of the Travancore State, became  Citizen as per the ratio of the Privy Purse judgement, by virtue of the  26th Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nThe SC judgement ratio upholding the conversion of Ruler to Citizen  of Anantha Padmanabhaswamy under Article 14 of the Constitution is to  create a common brotherhood. From this decision, all temple deities  should now be considered as citizens, as there cannot be a distinction  between one Hindu deity and another in our Constitution under Article  14.\n\nIn the Citizenship Act of 1955, Section 2(f) reads as follows:  “‘person’ does not include any company or association or body of  individuals, whether incorporated or not”.\n\nIn Section 2(31) of the Income Tax Act of 1961 “person” was defined  including “artificial juridical persons” and the SC held in a 1969  judgement that Hindu deities can be taxed as per this definition.\n\nIn view of the above, since Section 2(f) of the Citizenship Act of  1955 did not bar Hindu deities as juristic persons from the definition  of the term “person”, clearly there is no bar for the Central government  to register Hindu deities as citizens under Section 5(a).\n\nIn view of the fact that the Central government granted citizenship  to Lord Padmanabhaswamy Deity as Ruler when the Travancore kingdom was  integrated, as held by the SC in its 1971 judgement, and due to the 26th  Amendment of the Constitution and the ratio of the SC judgement of 1993  upholding the same under Article 14, it is now duty bound to register  all Hindu deities as citizens under Section 5(a) of the Citizenship Act.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A deity does not have constitutional rights: Justice Chandrachud \n\nJustice Chandrachud observed that the law recognises an idol or deity  as a “juristic person which can own property and can sue and be sued in  the court of law”. But to claim that a deity is the bearer of  constitutional rights is a distinct issue, the judge reasoned.\n\n“Merely  because a deity has been granted limited rights as juristic persons  under statutory law does not mean that the deity necessarily has  constitutional rights,” Justice Chandrachud observed.\n\n“The  fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are  geared towards the recognition of the individual as its basic unit. The  individual is the bearer of rights under Part III of the Constitution.  The deity may be a juristic person for the purposes of religious law and  capable of asserting property rights. However, the deity is not a  ‘person’ for the purpose of Part III of the Constitution. The legal  fiction which has led to the recognition of a deity as a juristic person  cannot be extended to the gamut of rights under Part III of the  Constitution,” Justice Chandrachud held.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nShould the Union Government  apply the same rule as that of the Rivers  Ganga and Yamuna and register all the temple deities as citizens so that many issues can get resolved with this one stroke ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-deity-does-not-have-constitutional-rights-justice-chandrachud/article25074235.ece***](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-deity-does-not-have-constitutional-rights-justice-chandrachud/article25074235.ece)\n\n[***https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/temple-deities-citizens-constitutional-rights***](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/temple-deities-citizens-constitutional-rights)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'aiatk3'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aiatk3/uttarakhand_court_ordered_ganga_yamuna_status_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: '[Serious] Just saved myself from getting robbed at 2am last night'<br />Body: 'I\'m writing it now as it just happened last night. To those who want a TL;DR, its at the end. \n\nPerfect setup for the term "highway roberry". Since past one year, I do a 15 min walk from my lab to home, across the highway, where I descend at the footpath, downwards like a hill. I have a habit of staying at lab till late, browsing reddit and stuff! It\'s just a 5 min walk after I cross the highway. As I got on the footpath lane, I got a REALLY bad vibe from a bike that just closely went past me and I saw the 2 faces which looked SCARY at first (one at the back had a cap on, never saw the faces, but the outline WAS SCARY which made me jump my shoulders) and made my eyes wide in attention as I was walking and ignored it as just usual traffic. The highway is usually busy with cars 24x7, but not the side of the highway which joins the end of the bridge to the main highway at this time. I guess they were looking for an opportunity for that small 400m window.\n\nDid I tell you I had earphones on blasting Rihanna? I just played that Diamonds song as it reminded me of old times. As I was halfway, looked back. I ALWAYS LOOK BACK from that place, just to be vigilant, has become a habit, even though not a single bad incident has happened to me so far. I saw a guy about 50m behind me. I was like, alright? Harmless? Has happened in the past so nothing uncommon to have people behind me but 2 am was a little odd, which I shouldn\'t have ignored. But today I was just making sure twice by looking back and he was closing in and I was hearing some noises which I ignored AGAIN that I shouldn\'t have. Just at that moment, the street dog that lived there started barking LOUDLY but not at me, which I was expecting since I have intimidated that dog in the past. HE WAS BARKING BEHIND ME. I suddenly got an adrenaline rush, kept walking while looking back, the guy was helding his hand out, towards me, so I took out my goddamned earphones and heard *"bro, ruk na"* in the most sweetest voice ever. I started running a little, maybe 6-7 steps and he was *"bro, bhag kyu raha hai? ruk na"*, while clutching with something hidden under his shirt, begrudgingly wanting it out. I noped out faster and he stopped on his way and I saw a security guy on the side of the highway just outside the entrance of the apartment complex. I guess they already knew and had mapped out their window where the crime should happen. I described the events to the security and he said I did the right thing, as these type of thugs usually run away with your belongings like cash and phone. \n\nAll the time, he was never aggressive, did not intimidate me, did not ran after me. That was a facade he maintained, so that he can pounce at the right moment as threatening would obviously lead to me running and shouting.\n\nThose who want to know where it happened? It was in Mumbai. \n\nTL;DR: Two guys on a bike most probably robbers saw an opportunity at lone footpath lane, one follows me shortly. Dog barks. Alerted. Suspect: "bro, rukna". Me sprint a little. Suspect grudgingly clutches something. "bro rukna, bhaag kyu raha hai?" I pace. He stop, turn back. I see the bike light up, and goes away with the culprit. Me safe.'<br />Author: 'chole_puri'  id: 'ai9hqf'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ai9hqf/serious_just_saved_myself_from_getting_robbed_at/</li>

Just want to get a everyone’s thoughts on this bc I think a lot of people have the misconception that yoga is strictly limited to doing extravagant postures/poses, when in reality it’s much more than that. Yoga is meant to be practiced daily as a way of life not something you do at some 30-min workout session. \n\nYes, postures and poses are involved, but that’s not where it ends. How I understood the Upanishads when I read one of them was that those are ways to strengthen your body so that you can meditate for long periods of time to gain control of your mind and senses. The aim is to bring your attention away from the corporeal, materialistic world and unite one’s soul with Brahman (Supreme Reality). But please correct me if I’m mistaken in any way.\n\nSo all these people who call themselves “certified yoga instructors” and post images of themselves doing extravagant postures in front of beaches are focusing on the bodily benefits of yoga and missing the entire point.\n\nAnyway, I just wish people took more time to understand the history, struggle, and pain that is behind such a practice. I find it so disheartening when people take my culture and modify it in an attempt to make personal profit.

      <li>Title::: 'In defense of the Hindi language'<br />Body: '#Purpose\n\nA common argument I hear both from some Pakistanis and South Indians is that the Hindi language is one that comes from Persian or is an un-Indian mongrel tongue. The claims are motivated by an agenda: for Pakistanis, it is to claim that their are the forebearers of an Indian identity, for South Indians, it seems like it is a way to show how they are superior to their own countrymen North of the Vindhyas (you can go through the comments of a user named u/thisisnotmyrealun) to see these narratives at play. Other users such as u/Ashish-Bhose (yes, named after the one who created the derogatory “BIMARU” tag, which I would urge the mods to ban along with other caste and religious slurs) adhere to this as well. As an Indian, I would expect them to wish to defend something so native as Hindi, but maybe their own countrymen are their enemy. I don’t see why, but anyways.\n\nNow, my intention is neither to compel you to learn the Hindi language, demand it to be the national language, or bad-mouth the ones whose mother tongue is not Hindi. Rather, it is to correct this misinformation and denigration of a language spoken by and dear to over 500 million Indians. \n\n#Summary Part - 1\n\nThe mother of almost all North Indian languages, Sinhala, Khmer, and others are from Vedic Sanskrit, which, contrary to leftist claims, was the main spoken language of the masses in the Vedic era by the tribes of the Mahajanapadas. \n\nAs time progressed, however, among the masses, “corruptions” of Vedic Sanskrit emerged. These corruptions were known as “Prakrits.” In Sanskrit, “Prakriti” has flexible meanings, which include nature, deviation, artless, and vernacular. In short, Prakrits (there were several of them) were deviations from Vedic Sanskrit that developed starting the 3rd century BC to the 8th century.\n\n#Summary Part - 2 \n\n(Will add shortly)'<br />Author: 'KingfisherPlayboy'  id: 'ah64lu'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ah64lu/in_defense_of_the_hindi_language/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Streetside Linguistics #11 The Proto Indo whatever .. An episode on Meta Linguistics'<br />Body: '&gt; This episode is a rant. If you want to avoid rants, avoid reading. \n\nओ मेरे भाषा के विद्वान, \n\nजान के तू है अनजान,\n\nप्रोटो इन्डो की लीपा पोती \n\nबढती करके तेरी मुस्कान \n\nअभिमान है उस बोल पे तुझको \n\nमुझको पता तूने न कभी बोला है \n\nन कभी तोला है कांटे पे\n\nधर्म के ज्ञान तेरा बस गोला है \n\nभाषा है पथ की, मंदिर की\n\nमंडी की,मौन की और अंधी की,\n\nसंबंधी की, समाधि की, बोधि की,\n\nना भूल की वह सिर्फ तेरी पोथी की \n\nन सिर्फ तेरी पोथी की || \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; What is linguistics ?\n\nLinguistics is about abstraction. Abstraction of languages, dealing languages at a meta level, finding commonalities, patterns, and differences. I mean that is what Linguistics is supposed to be, this is the only definition that makes sense to me. \n\nThe first linguists of the world, I believe, were Indians. There are reasons for believing this, which I may only elaborate if someone asks. \n\nComing back to linguistics, and its genesis. Words have histories and structure to them, a study of which we call etymology. Most words are and could never be attributed to a singular object. You may think of "table" as a word for an object made out of some physical stuff on which you dine or study. But the table in "tabula rasa" or "clean table" means mind and not the physical table. "Keeping an eye" on something, doesn\'t mean that you pluck out your eyeballs and put it on the object. Here the meaning of "eye" is attention. \n\nNow, one may say that the meaning of the word depends on the context it is being used, word means nothing without the sentence. \n\nCountering it, the other may say that the word exists independent of the context, an instance of a word is invoked within the context whenever it is required. \n\nLet us just declare it bullshit because it is something like explaining a kid how to swing a bat using physics. This is the reason why I am afraid to touch any book on subject I love so much. \n\n##Enters Yaska \n\nYaska\'s Nirukta was not as much about theory of language or atomism, but about the fact that words that we use are semi-fluid entities and share multiple meanings which need to be discussed and understood. Yaska did that discussion for the Vedic words, i.e. Sanskrit. Yaska\'s work hence is one of the first attempts to go meta into a language without going nuts on its structure. \n\nAttached to Nirukta is a database of word-instances which we call Nighantu. Wait. Example. \n\nLet us call various meanings of a word, instances (naamani).\n\nSo, let me list down three instances for cloud, straight from Yaska\'s Nighantu : \n\n1. vrtra : coverer ( comes from vrta)\n\n2. ahi : dragon ( is pronounced as azhi in Avestan, gives words like Ahi Raavan in Sanskrit and Azgar in Persian)\n\n3. megha : cloud \n\nQuite strange, eh ?. The deeper we go in history, the more bizzare and interesting connections we find between words and their instances. In fact, the deeper we go, as in the case above (ca. 6th cent. BCE), there is not much of history to these word-instance pairs. The instances can not be explained by history or memetic theory. \n\nThe main subject of linguistics is hence three-fold, to tabulate such instances (which is Nighantu), tracing the roots of these instances (Nirukta) as well as understanding the network of such instances (nobody did it). \n\nThe other subject, i.e. the structure of sentences, phrases, grammar etc. is also there. Enters Panini. I am yet to study Panini\'s stuff deeply, hence no meta. \n\n&gt; What is Proto-Indo European ? \n\nA reconstruction of all Indo-European languages, so as to mark a common source. Something to be enjoyed, but must not be taken seriously. \n\n&gt; Why ?\n\nI don\'t mean disrespect to all the great men who contributed to philiology, indology and the branch of linguistics. But the whole premise and bias of PIE is what I call lingua-mundi (the world language, the mother language). Part of it is guided by Biblical myth, part of it is shared by the deep human conviction that we all are connected (which guides the Bible). \n\nA simple trip to an island or an Indian countryside just rips apart such fantasies of reconstruction. There is a part of languages that is universal. There is a second part that could be arranged in families by studying etymology and grammar. There is third part which is highly localised and adapted that renders it unrecognizable to subjects outside its domain. The influence of each part is actually, surprisingly, in increasing order. \n\nHad it not been so, learning languages of the same family should have been a breeze, there would have been no Tamil dubbing for Baahubali, no separate trailer for Thackeray. \n\nBut it is the expert, who turns the world upside down.\n\nBut there is much greater problem with historical linguistics than just local adaptation.\n\n**Assymetry of the written language** \n\nAs far as reality is concerned, the written languages are a rarity, and spoken language is all there is. The expert gets to study only the written word. But the written language is only a selection. That selection is neither a "mean" of the spoken languages (dialects) nor is it a representative. It is just a random selection. Sometimes the selection is completely outside the local domain. For example : Sanskrit, Persian and English have all been used to rule India and tabulate Indian laws, but most population didn\'t converse in these languages. At least Sanskrit is a standardized but local language. Persian and English has nothing to do with India and its locality. \n\nThus, understandably, one does not need to move hundred thousand asses to migrate a language. Language travels much faster than people. In words of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Language follows the minority rule. \n\nIn fact, script travels the fastest. There were Bactrian, Greek coins in India. The Brahmi script travelled up and down, left and right all throughout the subcontinent and beyond, even where the court language couldn\'t. \n\n&gt; Indian-Persian, Aryan Migration \n\nLinguistics due to the reasons above is a very blunt and invalid tool to study human migrations. Only mythology could be called more blunt that linguistics. And Indologists have employed both in the most inappropriate of places. \n\nYou must have heard of Mittanis, vassals who briefly ruled over Medes (Kurdistan) for sometime in history (ca 1200 BCE). They invoked all the Vedic Gods in their treaty, the treaty which we call, for a lack of better word, Mittani Treaty. One doesn\'t need a migration to explain it.\n\nCut to Cambodia and Indonesia and Thailand, they invoke the names of Ramayana on a regular basis. There are 0.03% Hindus in Thailand and it was never more than 5%. \n\n##End Rant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'<br />Author: 'decoder007'  id: 'ah0ntn'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ah0ntn/streetside_linguistics_11_the_proto_indo_whatever/</li>

In the 1980s and early 1990s, he hosted major  fundraisers for former president George H.W. Bush and other senior  Republican lawmakers.*\n\n*The Indian government also lauded him for being instrumental in gifting  of sophisticated American medical equipment to Indian hospitals and  assisting in the rebuilding of hospitals in Latur, Maharashtra after a  severe earthquake.*\n\n*prosecutors have been unable to pinpoint Bothra’s net worth, which could be as high as $35 million.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook how well designed American policy is: note the frigging 'Indian'!

(Not Indian doctors, or the Chinese or the Mexicans). \n\nThe American govt is cleaning house by selling drugs within America - weeding out the 'weak' and simultaneously locking up the blacks; Mexico/Latin-America is ruined because of the drug trade and then can punish/make-submissive entire communities in preperaion for war. The drugs trade has killed WAY MORE people than an ISIS terrorist and the american govt/rich americans can get away with this policy because the average American is JUST LIKE the average Indian, pretty good-for-nothing and willing to lap-up a free meal (no zapping and being made to study)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat we need is:\n\n1. remove dual citizenship for all Indians\n2. force disclosure of citizenship status of all govt servents and their families - accessible via public database\n3. make compulsory, disclosure of all foreign assets held by all Indian citizens - accessible via public database\n4. make compulsory, disclosure of all Indian assets held by foreigners - accessible via public database\n5. hold Indian trials if Indians are arrested in foreign countries for whatever reason - you get punished twice (if convicted) or once in India (if you'r guilty of breaking our laws)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"<br />Author: 'veekm'  id: 'agu7aq'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/agu7aq/padmashriawardee_doctor_embroiled_in_healthcare/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Snapshot from Rocket Girl, 1962 and some vintage trivia.'<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/y7ginns1ssa21.jpg\n\nIn the old days, one of the ways a movie was advertised was through a photographic lobby card, an example of which is the above photograph. These were usually the size of a postcard and contained scenes from the movie. Over the years, it  became increasingly rare to find them and [osianama.com](https://osianama.com) did a remarkable job of digitizing and preserving them before they were lost forever.\n\nNow, this lobby card is from a film called Rocket Girl, released in 1962. Very unfortunately, no digital copy of the film exists, so we don't know the context of the rather interesting scene portrayed above. Fortunately though, there exists a legend in the field of old cinema named  *Arunkumar Deshmukh,* who is a living encyclopedia with all the information you can imagine about old songs, singers, music directors, film directors, movies, etc. He saw the movie in 1962 and has written down a review (which you can see [here](https://atulmovies.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/rocket-girl-1962/), along with reviews of lots of other obscure and forgotten films).\n\nSome background for the movie (in the words of Arunkumar Deshmukh):\n\n&gt; In the late 50s, Russians and Americans were doing lots of space research and in this Russia was ahead. They sent LAIKA, the dog in space on 3-11-1957 and then, Yuri Gagarin became the first man to go into the space on 12-4-1961, in Vostok II. There was lots of talk in the world about space travel and Indian Film Industry responded with, probably, its first Space related movie Rocket Girl. \n\nComing back to the movie itself, this was directed by Nanabhai Bhatt (grandfather of actress Alia Bhatt), who was famous for directing such fantasy films (another such film was *Sindbad-Jahazi (1952),* with scenes on a barque, quite unseen in Indian cinema).  The music was directed by the melodious composer Chitragupt (father of Anand-Milind duo). The film contains a famous [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVWfXyjHQPU) (sung by Mukesh and Kamal Barot, written by Prem Dhawan), through which I got to know about the movie.\n\nThrough this post I wanted to share some less talked about parts of our history.

I have no clue why any one would call it hyper-nationalist film. There are some strong scenes/messages in the movie e.g. when the niece says "I will become the first Lady General of the Indian Army" or when the lady officer pilot literally saves the men\'s ass at the last bit. One would argue that the screen time was too short for the character to develop, but the message was striking chord for those who are sensitive.\n\n* Secondly, by calling the movie hyper-nationalist, the so called liberals if anything down play the emotional part of the soldier\'s personal life. I haven\'t come across a bollywood movie which touches personal lives of an officer in a manner URI has (yeah I am aware of the other films that also show personal lives of field officers)\n\n* Some issues: First- I wish the dialogues like \'Desh bhi to ek Maa hai\', \'Unhe Kashmir Chahiye aur hame unka Sar\' weren\'t there, because those have been used again and again.

Let's see what he says about slavery in India. This account was noted around 100 BC.\n\n&gt;***of several remarkable customs, existing among the Indians, there is one prescribed by their ancient philosophers which one may regard as truly admirable; for the law ordains that no one among them shall under any circumstance, be a slave, but that, enjoying freedom, they shall respect the principle of equality in all persons: for those they thought, who have learnt neither to domineer over nor to cringe to others will attain the life best adopted for all vicissitudes of lot: since it's silly to make laws on the basis of equality of all persons and yet to establish inequalities in social intercourse.***\n\nAl-Beruni noted in 970 AD on caste\n\n&gt;***Between the latter two classes of Jati(Vaisya and shudra), there is no very great distance. Much however these classes(all four) differ from each other, they live together in the same town and villages, mixed together in the same house and lodgings.***  \n***After the Sudra, follow the people called 'Antyaja' who render various kind of services and are not reckoned among any caste, but only as members of certain craft or profession. The people called Domba, candala and Badhatau, they are not reckoned among any caste or guild. They are occupied with work like cleaning the villages and other services. They are considered one sole class and distinguished only by their occupations. In fact, they are considered the illegitimate children and live on outskirts of villages.***\n\nWas it a thing of Hinduism to discriminate against those in lower strata of society? In 100 BC, there is no discrimination, 1000 years later, there is a little discrimination and it went on to be perfected over time and became an institutional thing.

What\'s been happening in the world that we should take note of? Politics, sports, movies, scandal: discuss all that and more here. Topics and discussion *do not* have to be related to India. Here are a few stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Saudi Arabia to invest $10 bn in Gwadar](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/12/reuters-america-update-1-saudi-arabia-to-set-up-10-billion-oil-refinery-in-pakistan.html)\n\nPakistan had some positive news after a long time. Saudi Arabia\'s energy minister announced that the Kingdom will be investing $10 bn in Gwadar as part of CPEC, in the form of a crude oil refinery. He said this while on a visit to the Chinese-built deepwater sea port. In addition to the $6 bn assistance offered to Pakistan last year, this new announcement marks a significant new round of investment in Pakistan from a source that is not China. This is more significant as the announcement came from the Saudi side, as opposed to coming from the Pakistan side, that is usually premature.\n\n2. [Garment workers\' strike hits Bangladesh\'s economy](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Over-100-Bangladesh-garment-plants-halt-operations-in-strike)\n\nGarment workers in Bangaldesh have been on a massive strike in the country for several days, affecting over 100 factories and thousands of workers, and disrupting supplies of global garment brand H&amp;M. The strikers - many of whom are women - have faced police intimidation and violence, with 70 workers reportedly injured and one killed. The reason for the strike, ironically, is a 51% increase in the minimum wage for the industry enacted by the new government of Sheikh Hasina, which protesters claim has loopholes that deprives many people of its benefits in the face of price rises in recent years. Businessmen are also angry because the wage hike further erodes their profits, even as they are pressurized by global brands to improve working conditions. BD is the world\'s second-largest garment exporter after China.\n\n3. [Malaysia gets a new king, old one gets a new kid](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/wtf/king-of-malaysia-gives-up-throne-for-new-life-with-beauty-queen/news-story/5b613cbf36541fa7c3e7755a3c8aafba)\n\nMalaysia has a unique rotating monarchy, in which the king of the country \'serves\' for a period of five years and is then replaced by another king. All the kings in this list are kings of the respective Malaysian states, which became part of the Malaya Federation but retained their monarchies after the British granted them independence. This week, in a historic first, King Muhammad V stepped down from the position after just 2 years and has now been replaced by another regional king. But the reason behind the unprecedented abdication is just coming out now - the former King has reportedly married his Russian girlfriend (who converted to Islam for the purpose) and they are set to have their first child. Of course, this has sent shockwaves through the conservative country, where the King is the official head of Islam, the state religion. However, users have been circumspect in commenting on the issue, since the country has some harsh laws against criticizing the monarchy, a feature it shares with other SE Asian monarchies.\n\n# Top stories from around the world:\n\n1. [US govt shutdown becomes longest in history](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-12/u-s-government-shutdown-hits-record-length-with-no-end-in-sight)\n\nEven as President Trump refuses to engage with the Opposition Democrats - who control one of the two legislative chambers - till the latter agree to appropriate $5.7 billion to build his signature border wall (now made of steel), the partial shutdown of the US government became the longest in history, going on for 23 days. The White House is supposedly preparing for negotiations to drag on into February. Trump\'s Republican allies are encouraging him to declare a national emergency on the southern border with Mexico to build the wall without congressional approval, a move that would be instantly challenged in courts and would set off a shocking new precedent. However, Trump is holding off on doing that, but has pointed out that the wall was an election promise that he made and that he intends to keep. Currently, million of federal employees are not being paid, and some of their are being forced to work without pay. As a result, several unions are set to sue the federal government. One airport is also looking to decrease hours of operation due to a shortage of security check agents.\n\n2. [Data points to possible recession in Germany](https://www.businessinsider.com/germany-just-went-into-a-recession-2019-1)\n\nGermany, the world\'s fourth-largest economy, seems to have unexpected fallen into a recession in the second half of 2018, according to recently-released data. According to the numbers, Industrial production fell by 1.9% month-on-month in November, which translates into a sharp 4.6% decline year-on-year. Many economists that the data will be adjusted slightly upwards as it seems to be an outlier; nonetheless, it seems undeniable that the country\'s economy is either stagnant or shrinking slowly. This news could have a cascading effect on the rest of the EU.\n\n3. [Brazil withdraws from UN migration pact](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-migration-accord-united-nations-venezuela-refugee-crisis-a8721461.html)\n\nNewly-inaugurated President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who has sworn to rid Brazil of Marxism, has ordered officials to withdraw his country from a UN migration pact signed just last month. While the pact is not legally binding on party states, which can still enforce their own immigration laws, withdrawing from it symbolizes a new approach for Latin America\'s largest economy that has traditionally been welcoming of immigrants. However, the recent influx of refugees from the socialist utopia of Venezuela has stoked anger at migration from Bolsonaro\'s base, and he tweeted,  “we will never withhold help to those in need, but immigration cannot be indiscriminate." He added that, “anyone who comes here must be subject to our laws and customs, and must sing our national anthem and respect our culture.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are the stories from the world that caught your interest?

      <li>Title::: "Has anyone gone through the 'FOREWORD' of NCERT books, I accidentally read it and felt no match in way it prescribes teaching and the way we were taught. What do you feel? Here I have provided the same for you..."<br />Body: '**FOREWORD:-**\n\nThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends thatchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.\n\nThis principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning,\n\nwhich continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the\n\nschool, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\n\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.\n\nThey also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of\n\nsharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\n\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child centered\n\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on\n\nEducation (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\n\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\n\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\n\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\n\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by\n\nadults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of\n\nexamination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites\n\nof learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\n\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as\n\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\n\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\n\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required\n\nnumber of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods\n\nused for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\n\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,\n\nrather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have\n\ntried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\n\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration\n\nfor child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\n\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\n\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\n\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training\n\n(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development\n\ncommittee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson\n\nof the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the\n\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for\n\nthis book, Professor Tapas Majumdar for guiding the work of this\n\ncommittee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this \n\ntextbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible.\n\nWe are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which have\n\ngenerously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and\n\npersonnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National\n\nMonitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary\n\nand Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development\n\nunder the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.\n\nDeshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an\n\norganisation committed to systemic reform and continuous\n\nimprovement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments\n\nand suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision\n\nand refinement.\n\nNew Delhi\n\n20 November 2006\n\nDirector\n\nNational Council of Educational\n\nResearch and Training'<br />Author: 'ashishrshandilya'  id: 'af6ki6'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/af6ki6/has_anyone_gone_through_the_foreword_of_ncert/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Should India continue to maintain its western orientation? Explaining anti-H1B sentiment in America and its connection with India's ambition"<br />Body: 'So today, a very popular and well known conservative American commentator tweeted this:\n\n[https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/1083824577384308737](https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/1083824577384308737)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd i\'m inclined to agree.\n\nWhat\'s important however, is that **this is a VERY commonly held view in America**. The presence of lowly-paid IT coolies in America gives Americans a fair bit of grief, and rightly so. \n\nThe only ones profiting from the H1B legislation are the corporations - specifically those in the tech sector - who continue to fight for their right to uphold the 300 year old American tradition of slave trade. \n\nMany Americans are often overlooked in favor of these IT coolies, and the companies claim that they are often left with no option. Government in America answers to the corporate interest, so they\'ll get their way, but its difficult to see a country with a declining middle class (and a worsening quality of life) being happy with the status quo. \n\nAmericans, unlike Indians, actually understand self-sufficiency. \n\nMany Indian IT coolies don\'t see themselves as slaves, because like their African predecessors, they were simply happy to reach the plantation. The plantation provides adequate nutrition and objectively superior living conditions. So what if they\'re tied to the land (or in this case, company)? Slavery cannot exist without some complicity on behalf of the slaves, but this still shouldn\'t distract us from calling out such "immigration policy" as morally objectionable. \n\nFrom the American point of view, H1B makes perfect sense, and it is perfectly in-line with their greater interest - which is to prevent India from becoming another China. \n\nUnfortunately, Indian media is inundated with pro-American (or should i say, American corporate) propaganda. Many lead columnists in India\'s most widely read english newspapers are cheerleaders for American immigration policy, and they constantly portray America as \'the land of opportunity\'. India, of course, isn\'t seen as the land of the opportunity. It is, in their words, "a dynamic workforce of the Anglophone world", or "the engine-room of the west". \n\nI don\'t blame the older Indian elites and secularists for seeing, and even promoting, India as a slave colony. That\'s fine. India isn\'t as wealthy as America. Food on the table is all that matters, right? In a post cold war era, within a unipolar world, it was perfectly justified to think this way. \n\nHowever, we\'re no longer in a unipolar world. And with China\'s rapid rise - and corresponding decline in outward immigration - is it time to think differently? Especially when you have an alternate "development" model staring you right in the face from the other side of the border. \n\nI\'ll ask the bigger questions: **Can India ever aspire to be anything more than a glorified, modern-day slave colony for the West?** Can young India ever aspire to be anything more than "the engine-room of the west", trying to fuel its big ambitions with small remittances? Is it sustainable to build an economy around foreign investment and remittances?\n\nMy belief is that self-sufficiency and independence is still an alien concept to India and its elites. What do you guys think? Has the country out-grown this mindset?
