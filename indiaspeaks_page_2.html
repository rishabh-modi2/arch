Creating it's own unique fauna.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ql2wfiwg1291.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=166b76fa0dd54c1ad71aefbf01c9e46efb477009\n\n \n\nThe vast emptiness, miles and miles of salty marshes, make this one of the most surreal places on earth.\n\n**Chandipur Beach, Odisha**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqyggptzg1291.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5223472b42d70a29da16d27270feda6b647679b4\n\n \n\nOne of the most surreal places, where the sea water recedes 5 km every day, during low tide, which means you can walk right into it. You can take a trip to Balasore, which is on the Chennai-Howrah rail route, and from there drive down to Chandipur.\n\n \n\n**Gahirmatha Beach, Odisha**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hy7meq2h1291.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5acd6f4eb596d6502db8f22a0e090d635cde3bf\n\n \n\nThe world's largest Olive Ridley turtle sanctuary, you should come here, during the nesting season. You have like thousands of these turtles nesting here, laying eggs, and returning back to sea, making it one surreal spectacle. Again you can go till Bhubaneshwar, capital of Odisha by rail or air,and from there visit the beach, it also has the Bhitarkanika National Parkl nearby, famous for it's crocodiles.\n\n**Borra Caves, Vizag,Andhra Pradesh**\n\nLocated near my home town Vizag, these natural rock cut caves, often have some surreal imagery in them, fascinating place. Take a trip to Vizag, catch the train or bus going to Borra Caves located in Eastern Ghats amidst thick jungle, and lose yourself in their beauty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqxrv6p7h1291.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10bcc1c0f77daf1ebb926d5cdddc298d659b35b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owta48h8h1291.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52249422907a0c8eea1fcd803a7b8b31f14dc7d\n\n \n\n**Belum Caves, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh**\n\nAgain not very well known, but equally worth a visit.

So this OP made a post trolling modi and hindus for his political aspects and its okay. Then along the conversation he posted a link which had a video of a cow all 4 legs tied and is struggling with a slit throat on a BJP flag while others encourage and watch. A term Bulla was being used and I changed it to my version : NALLA. I'm not politically inclined to the said parties. In fact I hate the violence that has recently engulfed many places in our country in the name of religion. But the mods couldn't tell me yet that how was I wrong and the OP who post about it and was bragging it to be right and fun. And finally threatened to ban me if I vented elsewhere. So the mod doesn't realize that his false sense of power is as irrelevant to him/her. This is what I told the mod. And he/she muted me and I left. It it really that difficult to be just ?

      <li>Title::: 'Samsung has become Scamsung'<br />Body: 'TL;DR: Samsung Galaxy F41 phone got stuck in Bootloop + pink patch on screen, Service Rep informs Motherboard Dead Despite phone being booted by them + Screen Replacement Needed + Water Logged damage in charging port. Denied for any waiver in charges by Grievance Office assigned by CEO Desk. \n\nSo, Somehow Samsung Phones are so highly engineered that despite water in charging port the phone charges and are so fragile that small pressure on Corning Gorilla 3 screen can result in screen replacement. Somehow the phones also dont short circuit despite having water but get stuck in bootloop which entitles a replacement for the entire motherboard.\n\nSo avoid Samsung Phones (Esp in the low to Mid Segment) cause they are engineered to fail after a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\'s gonna be a long post, Sorry for that. \n\nSo I had bought the Samsung F41 for my Dad in Jan 2021. Around 6-7  May, I had my phone Updated to OneUI 4.\n\nAfter 2-3 days of using the new software, the device suddenly rebooted and then it got stuck on Samsung Logo and refused to bootup. I also noticed a small pink patch at the bottom right of the screen. I tried multiple times to restart the device but every time it got stuck at "Samsung Powered by Android." By the end of that day there was some serious Burn-Ins on the OLED due to this.\n\nAt night I tried formatting the device by booting it into recovery mode and Wiping data + cache. It didnt bear any fruit too. I even tried flashing the full stock ROM using ODIN but it still didnt work. So giving up hope I visited the Service center where I was informed that Motherboard is Dead and needs to be replaced. I was also told screen doesn\'t need replacement atm as the patch is very small. Finding it very absurd I raised the complaint at Samsung CEO desk India where I was later informed to submit the device at Service Center and mail them the Job Sheet.\n\nNext Day I Visited a different service center in hopes for some better result.\n\nThe rep examined the phone and I was informed since the pink patch now a good half of the bottom, the screen will need to be replaced too. (basically the Pink patch was auto expanding despite being not used). When I asked how come that patch forms, I was told that due to pressure the components inside the screen gets damaged. ( Which btw I think is total BS cause there is not even a scratch on the screen but somehow the internal components are damaged).\n\nThen next, Service Rep took the phone and after 30mins the rep was able to boot it up. (Much to my amazement, when I asked how did they boot it up, the rep replied that they plugged it in a machine). The rep was surprised because the phone booted up formatted so I can definitely say they din\'t format the device. \n\nNext, the rep took the photos of the phone and Made the Job sheet and mailed it to me. On the Job Sheet, it mentions Defects as: "Patch on Display &amp; AUTO Restart". I was told the phone will be taken for further inspection and I informed of the result.\n\nAfter that I left service center and mailed the Job Sheet to the assigned person. Later, on the same day I get a call from the service center informing that Motherboard Needs to be replaced + Screen Replacement + Water Logged in charging port. Which brings the total cost around \\~‚Çπ11.5K for repairs. To put things in perspective I Bought the device for ‚Çπ14K.\n\nThe Officer then connects me to a grievance office who basically informed me because there is water they cant do anything as the water has caused damage. I simply asked if water is there then how did service center without removing the water booted up, to which I was informed I will get a call back after 2-3 Days where I was again told same story. \n\nI have searched and found various people had similar issues with mother board/screen. GSMArena reviews of M21 &amp; F41 are filled with people whose Mobo Died after 1 year making this issue quite widespread. \n\nFrom my analysis, the company is well aware of Failing Motherboards which they smartly labeled as **auto restart** problem in the device to confuse the customer. Samsung needs to own up their mistakes and atleast give free replacement for Mobos in such cases. Though I think Screen Issue is also their fault but I can\'t prove anything for screen pressure non-sense story.\n\nI hope everyone will save your money and avoid these garbage devices.\n\nI am linking various complaints with same Issue:\n\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Samsung-M21-motherboard-failure/td-p/9598409](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Samsung-M21-motherboard-failure/td-p/9598409)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-Store-Apps-more/Pink-spots-on-screen/td-p/9853324](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-Store-Apps-more/Pink-spots-on-screen/td-p/9853324)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Samsung-M21-Pink-spots-expanding-every-minute-Service-center/td-p/7955854](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Samsung-M21-Pink-spots-expanding-every-minute-Service-center/td-p/7955854)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Pink-spot-on-the-left-corner-of-screen/td-p/4716792](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Pink-spot-on-the-left-corner-of-screen/td-p/4716792)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-A/pink-spot-appears-in-my-samsung-A50/td-p/4669585](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-A/pink-spot-appears-in-my-samsung-A50/td-p/4669585)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Samsung-M30-phone-display-Pink-Spot-problem/td-p/9180946](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Samsung-M30-phone-display-Pink-Spot-problem/td-p/9180946)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Galaxy-M31-Display-issue-screen-bleeding-purple-pink-smudge/td-p/8959990](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Galaxy-M31-Display-issue-screen-bleeding-purple-pink-smudge/td-p/8959990)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-A/progressive-pink-blue-black-discoloration-of-my-M31s-phone-under/td-p/6436380](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-A/progressive-pink-blue-black-discoloration-of-my-M31s-phone-under/td-p/6436380)\n* [https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-m-series-and-a-series-users-in-india-facing-auto-restart-freezing-issues-1817964-2021-06-22](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/samsung-galaxy-m-series-and-a-series-users-in-india-facing-auto-restart-freezing-issues-1817964-2021-06-22)\n* [https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Hanging-m21-on-boot-screen/td-p/9204274](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-M/Hanging-m21-on-boot-screen/td-p/9204274)\n* [https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung\\_galaxy\\_f41-reviews-10498.php](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_f41-reviews-10498.php)\n* [https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung\\_galaxy\\_m21-reviews-10111.php](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_m21-reviews-10111.php)'<br />Author: 'kunal_ag'  id: 'uyufeu'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uyufeu/samsung_has_become_scamsung/</li>

Well I know that his political ideology is very left leaning and it's been for a while and his reaction is most likely that of a leftist who is in denial of genocide and exodus and the radicalization in Kashmir but me being a cinephile watched it with all his points in my mind again because I proud myself for  analysing a film objectively to whether it was good or bad with all its technicalities and for a split second thought I was lagging. \nIt was better than when I saw it for the first time. It's a very honest narration of the greater tragedy of kashmir. And Vivek agnihotri did a fantastic job of sneaking in legitimate counter points from the kashmiris but at the same time talking about the root of all the action. Krishna being a confused youth representative of today's youth who is confused and is being brainwashed with propoganda. And Anupam Kher really played with my heart strings there. I thought both darshan Kumar and Anupam Kher were absolutely fantastic. The only issues I think I had was the cheap CGI but really can't blame Vivek agnihotri on that cause this wasn't some big production house produced film, it was truly an indie film where Vivek Sir used his own money. Another issue I had was that of the reduced or toned down brutality of the actual events, i genuinely don't think that it should have been that but I heard that some families had objection over showing such events so maybe they had to. I think they could have shown more of states reluctance to do something about kashmir to show more clearly the state's agenda and the local Kashmiri politicians aiding them. Also they were going back and forth between choosing a storytelling pattern on whether we follow one family or follow the greater story of Kashmiri Hindus. That's the only actual flaw that bothered me but this movie has made me feel like a very few have. I think it's a Fantastic movie and clearly my friend was coming from a left bias.

      <li>Title::: 'The 1971 Files- I'<br />Body: " The 1971 liberation struggle in East Pakistan, by the Bengali speaking community, was marked by large scale massacres and a terrible genocide, on par with the Holocaust, the Khmer Rouge massacres or Stalin‚Äôs forced collectivization. This is a series of posts that looks at the massacres, in which mostly Hindus were killed.\n\nMost of these massacres took place as part of Operation Searchlight by the Pakistan Army to curb the Bangla nationalist movement in 1971, and would lead to the genocide in Bangladesh, that saw around 3 lakh killed, and 10 million fleeing to India as refugees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q50zhfx91y191.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a8c028066a359d0c8066257c1e30e2166671d1f\n\n \n\nOne such was Burunga small village in Slyhet division of current day Bangladesh. On the afternoon tension mounted in the village over the arrival of the Pakistan Army on May 25,1971.\n\nThe local village head Injad Ali, announced a peace committe, and peace cards were distributed to assure the Hindu residents. Residents assembled in the local high school ground around May 26, more than a 1000 gathered. The Razakar collaborators Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque arrived around 9 AM at the school, with the Pakistani army unit led by Capt Nur-Ud-Din. By 10 AM, they segregated the crowd into Hindus and Muslims.\n\nMuslim residents were made to recite the Kalma, the Pakistani national anthem, and let off. Some of the Muslims were ordered to tie the hands of the Hindu residents behind their backs. One of the captive Hindus Srinivas Chakraborty managed to escape, as also the headmaster Priti Ranjan Chowdhury and Ranu Malakar, from a window. The others were not so fortunate.\n\nThe tied up Hindus were bought to the school ground and made to stand in 3 columns of 30 each. Capt Nur Ud Din, ordered the Pakistani army to fire on them, and 90 of them lay dead. The dead bodies were later burnt. Ram Ranjan Bhattacharya a prominent lawyer in Sylhet was shot from behind. The Razakars led by Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque looted the village and molested the Hindu women.\n\nThe Pakistani army arrived the next day, and burried the burnt, half burnt corpses of the Hindus in a pit. Some like Srinibas Chakraborty, Jitendra Baidya and Adhir Malakar survived the massacre, and it was Chakraborty who would narrate the ordeal.\n\nOne of the largest massacres of Hindus in East Pakistan during by Pakistan Army at Chuknagar, in Dumuria upzilla of Khulna division on May 20. Around 10,000 are estimated to have been massacred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0c0axvc1y191.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d36a5682a8c24d21b981575a80108c23ee6d2b92\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2930r6ud1y191.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deeaecf6253594f45117cfcab7db80e0229d3e43\n\n \n\nChuknagar is located very close to the Indian border. The Hindu refugees had crossed Bhodra river, and planned to cross over to India via Satkhira Road. By May 15, 1971 many Hindu refugees had gathered in large numbers here, planning to cross over. Around 10 AM on May 20,1971, around 10-30 Pakistani army personell, arrived in trucks with machine guns and semi automatic weapons. The firing began at the Pathkola grounds and later to Chuknagar Bazaar, stopped only at 3 PM.\n\nAround 10,000 were estimated to have been killed in what was one of the worst massacres of 1971. Many jumped into the river to save themselves. Memorial was built in tribute to those who were killed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j84pyd4g1y191.png?width=277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be78539991b1c0a767c30b813dbb3b790c62a6b\n\n \n\nAround 900 Hindus killed by the Pakistani Army and local Razakars at Demra in Pabna dt, on May 13, 1971, as part of Operation Searchlight.\n\nBangladeshi Hindus fleeing to India, had taken refuge in a remote village of Baushgari under Demra. The Pakistani army along with the Razakars, entered the area cordoned it off. Around night they entered the village, and the horror began. Men were dragged out of their homes and shot dead, while the women were raped and shot dead. Around 350 Hindus were killed in what was one of the terrible massacres. Others would be killed in neighbouring villages.\n\nThe mastermind of Demra massacre was Motiur Rahman Nizami, a Jamaati leader, who ironically served as MP from Pabna twice after formation of Bangladesh. He was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2014, and executed on May 2016. was the 3rd minister to be found guilty of war crimes, and hanged. He had actually called the Hindus of Bausbarhi for peace talks, and then got them massacred by the Pakistani army.\n\n [https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/10/29/bangladesh-to-hang-jamaat-e-islami-chief-nizami-for-1971-war-crimes](https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/10/29/bangladesh-to-hang-jamaat-e-islami-chief-nizami-for-1971-war-crimes)\n\nNizami actively supported the Razakars, who aided the Pakistani Army's reign of terror and genocide in East Pakistan. He was convicted on 8 counts and sentenced to death.\n\nMore than 100 massacred at Barguna on May 29,30, majority of them were Bengali Hindus, rest were Muslim supporters of Awami League. The Army explicitly targeted the Hindu localities of Amtala, Karmakarpatti and Nathpatti, rounded up around 600 residents.\n\nThe captives were segregated, the women were taken away gang raped, men were shot dead, or smashed in the head. A prominent businessmen of the town Lakshman Das and a doctor Krishna Das were among the victims.\n\nOn May 22, Razakar collaborators attacked the village of Bhimnali in Barisal district, and overpower the Hindu residents who resisted with spears. A group of 500 entered the village, killed around 20, threw the dead bodies in a nearby canal,and looted the homes.\n\nAgain on May 2, around 100 Hindus in village of Gabha Narerkathi, of Barisal dt, are massacred by the Pakistan Army and their Razakar collaborators. Most of the victims were lined up and shot dead by machine guns.\n\nOn May 15, More than 500 Hindus massacred, at Ketnar Bil, Barisal district, by Pakistan army and Razakar collaborators. Deserted homes were set on fire. Around 19 persons of the Patra family were killed, the bodies were dumped in mass graves.\n\nOctober 7- Around 30 Hindus massacred by Razakars at Suryamani village of Barisal dt. The raiders gang raped the women, and the men were lined up near the canal, shot dead. The culprits were Abdur Jabbar Engineer, Iskander Ali Mirdha, Mukul Badshah.\n\nAbdur Jabbar served as MP later, was Vice Chairman of Jatiya party, Iskander Ali would be a leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Md.Ansari Khalifa was a prominent Jamat-E-Islami leader."<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'uyprg4'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uyprg4/the_1971_files_i/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why German and Japan managed to rebuild their countries from the destruction of World War II, but India could not on same level post independence.'<br />Body: ' \n\nActually one cannot really do a comparison per se here, as Germany and Japan are more homogenous nations, compared to India which is far more diverse. However there were some factors.\n\nOne major factor was the US pumping in aid actively for reconstruction in both countries, basically I guess to prevent another fascist-military regime taking over. . The Marshall Plan in case of Germany and the Occupation, Reconstruction period in Japan, went a long way. But there was another major reason too, in the case of both Germany and Japan, the US took care of their defense too. What happened in effect was that the US told them *"Hey don\'t worry about protecting your country, we will set up the Army here, we will take care of that, you guys just look after rebuilding your nation".* So what it meant in effect, was that Germany and Japan did not really worry about what would happen, if some one attacked them, Uncle Sam was always there. Of course Uncle Sam\'s objectives were not altruistic either, it needed both these countries as a check against Communism, and also to ensure that they did not again become a military headache.\n\nIn the case of India, we had the two hostile neighbors one on our Western part, and another in the North, breathing down the necks. Now having a hostile neighbors for company need not be an impediment, Israel is practically surrounded by them, but it does have the support of Uncle Sam. India on the other hand never had a backing from the West militarily, and that meant it had to fight it\'s own battles to protect it\'s borders, with some support from USSR. So where Germany and Japan were free to focus on rebuilding their countries, without worrying too much about a possible war, India on the other hand had to build an economy, fight wars, take care of it\'s people, a daunting task by any standards.And it\'s birth as an independent nation was quite painful, first we had the Partition, which saw refugees flooding the nation, people losing homes and families. And then we had to integrate all those princely states, principalities into the country, initiate a military action against the Nizam of Hyderabad, when he refused to join. Germany and Japan on the other hand, did not really have to contend with such issues, they could straightaway get on with the task of rebuilding.\n\nOne more factor, was that Germany and Japan had a strong industrial, technical and scientific base on which they could build back. While the countries were bombed to rubble and in case of Japan even nuked, their technical and scientific know how was still intact. You can destroy a city, but you cannot destroy ideas or knowledge. So while physically Germany and Japan were devastated during the War, they had a pool of scientists, engineers, technocrats, planners, architects and a whole wealth of knowledge pretty much intact. And this helped them to rebuild their cities and nations much faster.\n\nIndia on the other hand, was just about finding it\'s fee in the scientific and technical world, it literally had to start from scratch. That meant it had to not just build the infrastructure, it also had to create the colleges, universities which could produce people to build dams, roadways, highways, buildings. The fact is that Germany and Japan were already industrialized nations that had to be rebuilt, India on the other hand was primarily an agricultural nation, transitioning to an industrial nation. Always a much tougher task, add to it, being a democracy, meant unlike China, we could not just ride roughshod over the population, to do whatever we wanted to.\n\nGermany and Japan were pretty much homogenous, regional and class differences apart, the people there spoke one language, had the same value system and were of the same ethnic stock too. India on the other hand was a continent by itself, with it\'s multitude of languages, races, ethnicity, value systems and cultures. What it meant that was we had to take a whole lot of conflicting class, caste, religious, regional interests that we had to cater to. And being a democracy meant we just could not thrust a decision down the throats of people, we had to balance out between the demands of various interest groups( and we still do to date). It also meant we had to grapple with a whole lot of issues regarding to river water sharing, inter state rules, variation in tax structures, which to date are yet to be resolved.\n\nWhile the above points, are valid, it does not take away the fact that an incredibly corrupt and inefficient system has prevented India from realizing it\'s true potential. Now corruption is an issue, that is prevalent among the world, but there is a difference. In Germany and Japan, the corruption is there at top most level, of linkages between politicians and businessman. Every year, politicians in Japan are routinely indicted in some scam or other. The difference though is that in India, the corruption is prevalent from the top to bottom. There is no way, you can try to bribe a cop in Japan or Germany, to let you off for a traffic offense. Nor could you afford to get away with violating building regulations by bribing the officials, in Germany or Japan. Germany has the autobahn, Japan has the bullet trains, India on the other hand was saddled with something called Public Works Department, which can\'t even build a decent housing complex. It is not that, we can\'t do it in India, we have seen the Konkan Railway, the Delhi Metro, all of them projects that were executed well. But fact is the top to bottom corruption in India, meant we really could not build in the way we wanted. What it meant was that we had to put up with substandard roads, because the contract was given to some guy who managed to grease the palms and who knows zilch about roads( it has not changed much, our roads still continue to be as pathetic). What it means is that our malls, theaters, office buildings are as unsafe as they can be, because the builder greases the palms of officials, so that he need to bother about wasting time on implementing safety regulations. What it means is that we have old, rickety vehicles, plying on the road, loaded with more than permissible limit, because the owner managed to grease a few palms.\n\nThat was just one example, but for any nation to progress, it needs to invest in infrastructure, education, healthcare, India failed badly on that count, Germany and Japan invested heavily there, and the difference can be seen. And the attitude of the people too counts, people in Germany, Japan were more disciplined, responsible and most important of all had much better civic sense. We on the other hand, lack civic sense, we consider it our birth right to cut corners( kya farak padta hai), litter roads, public spaces. We consider it our birthright to break traffic rules, are too impatient to stand in a queue and take pride in defacing our monuments. Try scribbling something on the Brandenburg Gate or Cologne Cathedral, you sure would have wished you never did that. And it is not that we are like that, the same Indians who litter the roads here or indulge in all kinds of smart ass\\*\\*\\*ery, become model citizens in Germany or Japan, they would not dare not do it there. In the recent World Cup, the Japanese team supporters cleaned up the stadium, after the match was over, it was not really necessary for them to do so. But then that sense of civic responsibility was drilled into them from a young age, and it soon became a part of their value system. That is something we in India, failed to create a culture of discipline, civic responsibility and pride for one\'s nation and it\'s assets.\n\nIndia is not Germany or Japan, it is diverse, it had to face wars, it never had assistance from the West for a major part of it\'s modern history, but the fact is our corruption, attitude of anything goes, lack of civic responsibility, lack of a national pride, and a tolerance for inefficiency meant we have not been able to realize our potential to the best of our ability.'<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'uy637e'<br />Score:56<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uy637e/why_german_and_japan_managed_to_rebuild_their/</li>

On the afternoon tension mounted in the village over the arrival of the Pakistan Army on May 25,1971. The local village head Injad Ali, announced a peace committe, and peace cards were distributed to assure the Hindu residents. Residents assembled in the local high school ground around May 26, more than a 1000 gathered.\n\nThe Razakar collaborators Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque arrived around 9 AM at the school, with the Pakistani army unit led by Capt Nur-Ud-Din.

The others were not so fortunate. The tied up Hindus were bought to the school ground and made to stand in 3 columns of 30 each. Capt Nur Ud Din, ordered the Pakistani army to fire on them, and 90 of them lay dead. The dead bodies were later burnt.\n\nRam Ranjan Bhattacharya a prominent lawyer in Sylhet was shot from behind. The Razakars led Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque looted the village and molested the Hindu women. What was happening was nothing short of terrible. The Pakistani army arrived the next day, and burried the burnt, half burnt corpses of the Hindus in a pit. Some like Srinibas Chakraborty, Jitendra Baidya and Adhir Malakar survived the massacre.

      <li>Title::: 'What do classifications like Athirathi, Maharathi mean?'<br />Body: ' \n\nBasically all these are the different levels of warrior excellence, taking into account the mastery over weapons, and combat skills.\n\n**Ardha- Rathi**\\- The lowest level, considered half a rathi. This was what Bhishma had classified Karna as, though he was a Maharathi. An upset Karna, swore not to fight under Bhishma, as long as he was commander of the Kaurava forces. It‚Äôs believed though that Bhishma did this deliberately, as he knew the secret of Karna‚Äôs birth.\n\n**Rathi**\\- Capable of attacking 5000 warriors at once. All the 97 brothers of Duryodhan including Dusshasan, Shikandi, Jayadratha, Shakuni, Nakul, Sahadev were of this category.\n\n**Ekarathi**\\- Capable of fighting 8 Rathi class warriors. Bhim is the best example of this, single handedly killed all of Duryodhan‚Äôs brothers, as well as Dushashan. Duryodhan on the Kaurava side, was his counterpart.\n\n**Athirathi**\\- Capable of fighting 12 Rathi class warriors or 60, 000 warriors at once. Some of the more well known ones in this class were Kritavarma, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna, Vikarna, Kripacharya.\n\n**Maharathi**\\- Right in the top echelons, the deadliest of all the warriors, who could fight 12 Athirathi class warriors at once or the equivalent of 72,000 warriors. Mastery over all forms of weapons and combat skills. Bhishma, Karna on the Kaurava side, Arjun, Abhimanyu on the Pandava side.\n\n**Ati Maharathi**\\- A very high warrior class capable of fighting 12 Maharathis simultaneously. There were only 3- Indrajit in the Ramayan, Krishna and Parashuram.\n\n**Maha Maharathi**\\- The highest class capable of fighting with 24 Ati Maharathi warriors at once. As there never has been a situation when we had 24 Ati Maharathis, no one belonged to this class, but Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Brahma, the highest powers can be considered. The only one who came closest to this category was Ashwathama, considered to be an incarnation of Shiva himself. But he could assume this level, only when he was fully angry enough to unleash his potential. Much like Hanuman, he was unaware of his true potential, and only Drona, Krishna and Bhishma knew this.'<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'uxykjq'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uxykjq/what_do_classifications_like_athirathi_maharathi/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'What does the Mahabharat represent?'<br />Body: " \n\nMahabharat deals with military strategy, war craft, politics, administration, life, human pyschology. And then there is the Bhagvad Geeta within it, that is virtually an entire treatise on life, Dharma, Destiny, duty. It is far more complex, layered, not to mention the numerous sub stories within it. And that makes it much more relevant to modern times. The entire Kurukshetra war, the strategies and formations used on both sides, are pretty much similiar to what has been applied in latter day battles. The tactics used by Shakuni and Duryodhan against the Pandavas, and the counter tactics used by Krishna, pretty much sum up today's political world. The Vidura Neeti, deals with administration, duties of a king. Mahabharat to me is not just an epic, it is a virtual repository of wisdom and information on life and the world.\n\nNo character in the Mahabharat is perfect, including Lord Krishna, as every one follows the end is greater than the means principle. Every character in Mahabharat has their own grey areas, no one is fully good or bad. Arjun does not hesitate to kill Karna when he is totally helpless, likewise the latter has no compunctions in teaming up with Duryodhan to kill a defenseless Abhimanyu. The Mahabharat in that sense, is more closer to the modern world, a world where only survival matters, where the end is greater than the means, it is much more closer to reality.\n\nThe tales within the Mahabharat by themselves are fascinating, Karna's tale of misfortune, his friendship with Duryodhan. How Bhishma's vow of not being the ruler of Hastinapur, in a way contributes to it's own downfall. The Pandava's exile in the forest, and their living incognito in Virat during the Agnahtha Vaas, the entire Kurukshetra War. The tale of Drupad and Drona, friends turning enemies, and how the former uses Arjun to get back at his own Guru. The plots hatched by Shakuni against the Pandavas, and his own back tale.\n\nThe Mahabharat is about how ordinary human beings react to the situation, of how everything is fair, when it comes to the cause of Dharma.\n\nSource- My answer at Quora\n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-Mahabharata-represent/answer/Ratnakar-Sadasyula?\\_\\_filter\\_\\_=5&amp;\\_\\_nsrc\\_\\_=notif\\_page&amp;\\_\\_sncid\\_\\_=27182905647&amp;\\_\\_snid3\\_\\_=36982547469](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-Mahabharata-represent/answer/Ratnakar-Sadasyula?__filter__=5&amp;__nsrc__=notif_page&amp;__sncid__=27182905647&amp;__snid3__=36982547469)"<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'uxygnd'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uxygnd/what_does_the_mahabharat_represent/</li>

I have suffered a series of mental illnesses, complex trauma and a childhood diagnosis of aspergers. My functioning is pretty normal as an adult other than my inability to hold a job. My whole adult life here has been completely isolating, even my parents barely have any friends, none of our neighbors interact with each other, and we don't have any relatives here. My future here is bleak and I am on the verge of homelessness without parental support, rents are extremely high and the cost of living is only going up. I have never once felt at home here and always considered myself Indian. I feel constantly depressed and suicidal in this environment. My hope is that by moving there my situation will improve. I hope I will find it easier to socialize there, will have more of a chance to travel and experience life, and won't have to worry about working and be able to live off passive income. I'd like to know what the challenges of living in India are and if I am going in with unrealistic ideas?

I guess there may be more , but this state has laws to preserve their local languages, culture and are vocal critics of Hindi adaptation.\n\nHindi speaking belt or so called Hindi speaking belt, as majority of them have primary local languages, like Punjabi, Haryanvi, bhojpuri, marwadi, gujrati, bihari. Listing popular languages with considerable population and active politics. That's why not including north east languages as they also don't have much language politics. \n\nIn allegedly Hindi speaking belts, there are no law about using regionals languages for signboards, and shop names. You can use English, Hindi or your local language. Also most foreign language speakers are very much welcomed, no gujrati, Rajasthani or Punjabi will threaten or look down upon you for not knowing their local language. Trade and buisness is not hindered for not knowing local language. For that matter not even political Ambitions. \n\nFor example, pm modi used gujrati before being nominated to pm. Kejriwal belongs to haryana, who is cm of Delhi, and manmohan singh was sikh of Punjab who preferred English. Rahul Gandhi I don't know but I am sure his native language is not Hindi or English. I am not sure Yogi ever spoke bhojpuri, or Ashok Gehlot speaking marwari. As only madhya pradesh can claim it's local language as Hindi. My point being, in the alleged Hindi belt it doesn't matter where a person is born or which religion/caste he belongs to, or which language he prefers.he can generally win elections. \n\nBut when I see the rulling party of these language belts, except Karnataka with many struggles. Belongs to a very anti India and pro corruption party. \n\nAimm owaisi, is popular in Andhra, apparently the defender of telgu and Hindu tradition(in its movies). CPI(left) and PFI orginates from Kerala and has deep connection in Tamil. Bengal let's just not say what happens there. Maharashtra has joint goverment of corruption. Stalin was recently filmed garlanding a terrorists while being friends with Gandhi family. \n\nI guess all the state i listed has strict laws and political parties, claiming to preserve history, values and local language. Are you really happy? With your current government stands on various issues and how they preserve your tradition and nationalism. \n\nThe sad part about all this is, apparently this are most intelligent and educated belts of India, struggling to even get some type of pro Hindu party as legitimate opposition. \n\nIt's really sad to see them, btw everyone who has a feeling against Modi/bjp being pro Hindi. \nJust check out his tweets for regional languages. \nMann ki baat encourages questions from every language and is being aired with 20 local languages. He is praised every local languages, and local newspapers.\n\nDisclaimer: mother tongue of Amit Shah and Pm modi is Gujarati, they never gave speeches in Hindi before becoming national leaders/outside gujrat."<br />Author: 'Dry-Expert-2017'  id: 'uxkk6g'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uxkk6g/language_politics/</li>

The most powerful of the Chalukya kingdoms.\n\n**Eastern Chalukyas**\\- Following Pulakesin‚Äôs demise, and decline of Badami Chalukyas in 8th century, they became an independent kingdom with capital at Vengi(near to Eluru) covering the Krishna-Godavari delta in Andhra Pradesh. However they were mostly subordinate to Rashtrakutas, and it was only under Bhima I they became somewhat independent, ruled till 11th century.\n\n**Western Chalukyas-** Ruled from Kalyani( present day Basavakalyan in Karnataka), from late 10th century to end of the 12th century. They took over on the decline of the Badami Chalukyas, and were in constant conflict with the Cholas. Vikramaditya IV was the most notable ruler of this empire.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThey were known for their magnificient temples, monuments and buildings.

Nannayya the Adi Kavi, author of Andhra Mahabharatam, the first Telugu version, who also wrote the first treatise on Telugu grammar called Andhra Shabda Chintamani, belonged to this period.\n\n**Administration**\n\nThe Badami Chalukyas had a well organized Army, as well as a powerful Navy, that played a major role in Pulakesin II‚Äôs success beyond the Vindhyas.\n\nTheir administrative system was adapted from Magadha, Satavahana empires, divided into Maharashtrakas( provinces) which in turn were divided into smaller Rashtrakas( Mandalas), Vishaya( district), Bhoga( group of 10 villages). They had a system of local assemblies that primarily looked into local issues and merchant guilds. Different taxes were levied, herjunka( loads), kirukula( retail goods in transit), bilkode( sales tax), sidayya( land tax).\n\nThe Chalukyan era, was marked by a fusion of the North Indian Nagara Style and the Dravidian style of architecture, creating their own Vesara style of architecture. The Mitakshara, one of the most significant works that laid down the foundation for Hindu legal system was written during this period.

The majority of our current global problems are typically attributed to religion. I, on the other hand, consider cult mentality to be the issue. The mindset of proving one\'s superiority and attempting to convert others to one\'s "opinion." If they do not comply, they are morally and socially shamed. So, trying to get on top intellectually. Real religion formerly served to unite common people through a nonexistent higher power. It served the purpose of encouraging greater vulnerability and optimism among individuals.\n\nReligion no longer exists in the modern world. The majority of purported religions are dominated by avaricious individuals seeking to advance their cults through proxy cult wars. Consequently, a large number of people now lack hope and faith. I am aware that science and logic are the best approaches, but the majority of people are not so mentally robust. Whether we admit it or not, even those of us who believe in our intellectual superiority by looking down on those who believe in a supposed higher power are susceptible to hope and despair at various times. Therefore, religion served as a useful social tool for connecting people and fostering a shared faith.\n\nThe cult mentality has imbued believers with a sense of isolation, while those who look down on them are isolated by their supposed superior intellect. It appears bleak, but if we spare some effort to comprehend the common folk and attempt to overcome the isolation that we are all infected with, perhaps we will be able to overcome the prevalent despondency and hopelessness in the current society.'<br />Author: 'forprofitkiss'  id: 'uxixje'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uxixje/religion_is_not_the_problem/</li>

But every time, just get some kind of thrill, when the train gets on to the bridge. And I guess it has to do with the view of the Godavari River, from the bridge. Spreading out wide, stretching into the horizon, the sight is just spellbinding. The Godavari River is at it's widest stretch near Rajahmundry, and watching the river serenely follow under the bridge, while you are in the comfort of your rail cabin or in your car, travelling by the road bridge.\n\n**Pamban Bridge, Rameswaram**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uaieh0gvdm191.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fa405bbdbf0c913cd4d061f5e307afb3e75630\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtpvk38wdm191.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8960b3611f2f46c17f58b310e62fe549cfa96c93\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Pamban Bridge connecting the holy town of Rameswaram on Pamban island with the mainland is an engineering and architectural marvel by itself.

And while Rash Behari had his own escapades from the British, remember he changed his residence 17 times in Japan just to avoid detection, nothing like Bose journey in a German U Boat, half away around the world to Japan, or his trek across Central Asia. And yet in a way both men had the same burning desire for freedom, both nationalists, who believed that only an armed revolution could liberate India.\n\nTo know more about this great hero, do check out my article and podcast on him here.\n\nArticle- [https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/rash-behari-bose/](https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2015/05/29/rash-behari-bose/)\n\nPodcast-[https://anchor.fm/ratnakar-sadasyula/episodes/Rash-Behari-Bose-eaalmn](https://anchor.fm/ratnakar-sadasyula/episodes/Rash-Behari-Bose-eaalmn)\n\n[https://gaana.com/song/rash-behari-bose](https://gaana.com/song/rash-behari-bose)'<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'ux9ll5'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ux9ll5/rash_behari_bose/</li>

First impression that people have about Marathas that Marathas used guerrilla warfare against enemies and Rajput used Convention Warfare but I think Having this kind of view about both Armies would be completely unfair.\n\nWhen Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj  started Movement of Hindavi Swarajya with his few followers at that time he didn't have any kind of resources and personnel like a mature military, So as he started from scratch it was obvious that he will use guerrilla tactics against his enemies because there was no chance of building a proper army during his era as compare to Rajput who had Mature armed forces, Military infrastructure, other resources and well maintained live stock. But As Empire Maratha got Matured they actually engaged with invaders in proper conventional military warfare on battlefield( best example 3rd war of panipat).\n\nIn a same way when kunwar Maharana Pratap and Akbar faced some serious casualties during battle of Haldighati then Kunwar Maharana Pratap re- organized his army and fought with Mughal army by using guerrilla tactics in battle of dewair and for several years he fought like that.\n\nSo in my personal opinion we should understand the situation of both Empires... We can see that both Armies used same military tactics as per the situation. So saying that both Armies fought in different way would not be correct. You can share your opinion down below.... I would really like to read your opinion... Thank You...

The Japanese steamship carrying Indians trying to migrate to Canada in 1914, majority of whom were Sikhs, along with a fairly good number of Hindus and Muslims, all from Punjab. Only 24 of the 376 passengers were admitted, while the rest were turned back and the ship had to return to Kolkata. The British police tried to arrest the group leaders, leading to clashes and firing which left around 20 dead.\n\nThe incident bought into focus the discriminatory laws of US and Canada, that excluded immigrants of Asian origin during that time. But more than anything else, this event led to the rise of the Ghadar party as it's leaders used the incident to recruit more members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l651icyf46191.png?width=247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6be7ab07ab98f1362d2b9c3bdf0fb0e4e149ab1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBaba Gurdit Singh, the man behind this event, was born in Sarhali, located in Punjab‚Äôs Taran Taran district on August 25, 1860 to Sardar Hukam Singh. His grandfather Sardar Rattan Singh, a high ranking military officer in the Khalsa Army, had fought againt the British, and declined their offer of a jagir. Though Gurdit Singh dropped out of school, more due to problems with his teacher, he was able to educate himself privately. In 1885, he came to Malaya, where his father was working as a contractor.\n\nHe soon began to be involved in many businesses, importing cattle from India, operating a dairy, supplying milk to a Sikh regiment stationed there. As well as contracting labor for railway work, the rubber plantations, and dealing with real estate too. He soon became one of the well known Indian businessmen in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, and an influential member of the Sikh community there. Apart from Punjabi, he was fluent in Chinese, Malay and English which he learnt while working there.\n\nA devout Sikh, he regularly visited his native Punjab, and used to follow a mystic preacher called Ram Singh whom he invited to Malaya too. He also encouraged villgers to rebel against the practice of forced labor by Govt officials there. His influential status in the Sikh community abroad, got him in touch with many Sikh emigrants trying to migrate to Canada, US or Australia, and he often listened to the problems they faced.\n\nIt was one such meeting at a Hong Kong Gurudwara in December 1913, that motivated him to undertake the Komagata Maru journey. He presented himself as a businessman seeking to develop passenger trade between Asia and North America, to get around the Canadian exclusion laws.\n\nCanada had passed the Continuous journey regulation order on January 8, 1908, as per which any immigrants who did not make a continous journey from their country of birth or citizenship, were prohibited from entering the country. The order was clearly aimed at India, as ships travelling to North America usually made a stop over in Japan or China due to the large distance covered. Also Anti Oriental riots had broken out in Vancouver in 1907, against the Chinese, Japanese immigrants who had settled there.\n\nAround the same time, he also began to openly espouse the Ghadar Party ideology, a movement founded by expatriate Indians in US and Canada, to liberate India from British rule. The journey of the Komagata Maru began on April 1914, which he renamed as Guru Nanak Jahaj. The Canadian Government was aware of the fact that many of the passengers were Indian nationalists, intending to create disturbance there, which made it more determined to stop them.\n\nThe ship was originally scheduled to depart in March, however legal troubles and also the fact that the British had Gurdit Singh under surveillance, delayed the voyage. Finally the ship departed Hong Kong on April 4, 1914 with around 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai and Yokohama, where it made a stop over. Leaving Yokohama on May 3, 1914 with 376 passengers the ship reached Burrard Inlet near Vancouver on May 23rd. Bhagwan Singh Giani the head priest of the Vancouver gurudwara met the passengers.\n\nGiani Singh distributed pamphlets, books about the Ghadar ideology to the passengers of Komagata Maru. On arrival in Canadian waters, the ship was not allowed to dock, and met by Fred Taylor, an officer with the Immigration department. Though the Canadian PM Robert Borden was still deciding on the course of the action, British Columbia‚Äôs Conservative Premier, Richard McBride categorically stated that no passenger would be allowed to disembark.\n\nAnother Conservative MP H.H.Stevens, began to instigate the public against the immigrants, leading to their mistreatment on the ship. Meanwhile a Shore Comittee was raised by Rahim Hussain and Sohan Lal Pathak, to help the passengers. The comittee categorically declared, that if the passengers were not allowed to disembark, there would be an open revolt or Ghadr on Canadian soil. And also managed to raise $22,000 for chartering the ship along with a lawsuit.\n\nHowever the British Columbia Court of Appeal delivered an unanimous judgement that it had no authority to interfere with decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization. The passengers were now completely stranded. The furious passengers relieved the Japanese captain of comand, but the Canadian Govt,ordered the tug boat Sea Lion to tow it out, amidst angry protests. Finally by July 23, the ship was forced to return back to India, escorted by the HMCS Rainbow.\n\nKomagata Maru arrived in Kolkata on September 27, and was stopped by a British gunboat. The British Govt saw it as a serious threat, and when it docked at Budge Budge port, police were sent to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and 20 others whom they saw as the leaders behind the event. As Gurdit Singh resisted arrest, firing broke out, and around 20 were shot dead, while many escaped. He himself escaped, went underground, for a long time, till he voluntarily surrendered at Nankana Sahib on the advice of Mahatma Gandhi in 1920.\n\nHe was later released in 1925, and adopted the Gandhian route. Though the Congress tried to disown the Komagatu Maru incident, the Ghadr party used this well to instigate expat Indians in US and Canada. And also planned for a massive uprising along with Rash Behari Bose, which however failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Memorial in Budge Budge for those killed in the firing.](https://preview.redd.it/wcgrk35h46191.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c989f6c6f169a390976b5594d39268a676d30d5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource- My post on it at my blog.\n\n[https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/baba-gurdit-singh-komagata-maru/](https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/baba-gurdit-singh-komagata-maru/)"<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'uvtsx5'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uvtsx5/komagata_maru/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A review of Left, what they say and what they practice: Left behaves like Rudalis i.e. professional mourners'<br />Body: 'A quick question to you all. What do you do in the evenings, during dinner? I think we have a good custom in our home. We invite someone, usually elders, usually who spent some time in public life over dinner. When I say, we, it actually means my dad (and my bua\'s family) who has diverse contacts because of his long public life. But still, this custom is good. So, dad and the guest usually discuss few ideas while I am , let\'s say on "the sides". Their understanding of society is very deep and usually I don\'t have much to contribute, unless the topic is someway related to science. We usually have 2-3 guests a week and I take care of cooking good and tasty dinner, sometimes I listen in.\n\nSo, the following is a part of a discussion in which my dad presents his view on how left degenerated, not just in India but throughout the world too. BTW, he was an erstwhile communist leader, was in active politics for a while but quit after disillusionment.\n\n---\n\nLeft claim that they care for the poor and downtrodden. It claims to give a voice to those who don\'t. Left claims it has intellectuals who have a deep understanding of the society, knows how to develop a designed society, has ready made templates and prescriptions for problems that ail the society and the world at large.\n\nAt some point it so happened that other political ideologies have taken over and made the left redundant. Those political parties have started to offer what left says it does and then few more too.\n\nNow the role the left plays is very much like an uninvited Rudaali crying over a dead horse that no one cares about in hopes that some idiots might throw a few coins at them.\n\nThe imagery of a Rudaali is quite important here. A Rudaali has no gripe of her own. A Rudaali plays out a "a festival of grief" drama for the audience. If any coins are thrown at them in such a festival, they\'d be happy to collect them. Left behaves exactly in this fashion.They specialize in sympathy market. In order to monetize this sympathy market, they need an object of sympathy. And anyone who is disenfranchised is a Kamadhenu they could milk, as long as they can. So leftists are always on lookout for "downtrodden" for avenues of making money,fame,publicity, visibility.\n\nAnd in a world in equilibrium, leftists create a chaos that they can profit from. This is very similar to a Rudaali participating in a murder so that she could collect coins of tears. And this is manifested in left\'s alliance with Muslim causes in which they feel deprived or disadvantaged, real or imaginary and champion for them. If not, they research into issues which Muslims should take offense and then tell them to take offense. The irrelevance of left has pushed them searching for a suitable victim that they can rally around and make money and fame around them. Political parties like BJP and regional parties have encroached into the traditional terrain of the left and have offered them something much better. Finally left seem to have been left with a vague Muslim cause which no political party supports. And most of these causes are either anti national, or anti majority, pro separatists... in other words anti state and anti national.\n\nIt\'s interesting to understand why left has arrived at this place. When left identifies disadvantaged group, it immediately lends its voice. And that\'s it. Nothing much. What they offer is a publication, an article, a news clipping and a sensation. And it happens in cycles. Until someone comes along who figures out that they could do more than just a news byte, or a slogan and a rhetoric. Left doesn\'t believe in "Give a man a fish versus Teach a man to fish". This is because left doesn\'t know what to do or what it\'s role would be once people learn how to "fish". This is because left tries to collect it\'s votes on promise that people can "fish someday" in future and sells that hope. And this is because left doesn\'t believe in or experience democracy i.e they don\'t believe that people would vote them if they were empowered to "fish". And this is because left is inherently anti democratic.\n\nIt\'s a lot more interesting and important why  left has turned to this perversion. It is because left doesn\'t value people who are problem solvers. If a problem is solved, perhaps with some policy decision, then the leadership of left feels it as a loss of terrain on which they hunt. Problem seekers, creators are OTOH are entrepreneurs. \n\nAnd this is because of understanding of who constitutes a leftist intellectual. Any idiot can talk shit about the current government. Or any leftist can talk negative of the current government policies. But there is a difference between a left intellectual who with his deep insight into human behavior and society who is criticizing the rulers VS those who talk similar language and pretend to be a leftist intellectual. This is akin to a donkey with painted stripes pretending to be a zebra.\n\nA leftist intellectual in past had great connect with the society he lives in, it\'s inadequacies and a deep understanding of how it could be improved. He was a scholar. Because of his breadth and depth of understanding of society he was valued and so are his views. Because he had this kind  of understanding, he was quite critical and offered genuine solutions. One of the easiest ways to pretend to be a leftist intellectual is to just criticize anything or everything just like an intellectual does. For a common citizen it becomes difficult to differentiate between a genuine leftist and a pretend leftist.  \n\nIn context of India, the reasons of this degeneracy is our association with Soviet Union. To give an example, ~ 2 days ago, there was a conclave called "Ideas for India" and who was invited to speak there? Surprise surprise, all the opposition leaders who fail in mainstream elections. Why aren\'t leaders from ruling party,chosen by electorate who actually provide policy directions, whose ideas actually affect India economically,socially, internationally invited to speak at "Ideas of India"? Why are people who were deemed irrelevant by Indian electorate are being asked to present "Ideas for India", whose ideas will anyway won\'t see the light of the day? Ask this question and seek answers. You\'ll get many uncomfortable answers.\n\nDuring 70\'s 80\'s Soviet Union actually nurtured good for nothing idiots, elevated them ignoring people who are a lot more valuable with their ideas in Universities and politics. So people like D. Raja, Sitaram Yechury, who are bankrupt with any productive ideas are bought into mainstream politics by "selection".

      <li>Title::: 'PV Narasimha Rao: A leader who made us all proud'<br />Body: 'Places of Worship Act 1991 - P. V. Narasimha Rao - Review.\n\nTwo days ago, some idiots and unclean widows made a vile address to former Prime Minister Shri Pamulaparthi Narasimha Rao, a multi-talented and extra-Chanukya. This post is for them.\n\nBy the time Shri PV Narasimha Rao took over as Prime Minister in June 1991, the economic situation of the country was very bad.\n\nDuring the reign of Chandrasekhar Gari, the Prime Minister before PV Narasimha Rao \\[January, 1991\\], the economic condition of our country was such that we had only three weeks\' worth of dollars to pay for emergency imports. The dollars reserved for crude oil imports, however, are only enough for a week. Oil reserves already in our country are only enough for another two weeks while crude imports are just another week away but we have no dollars to pay. There are enough dollars for two weeks for imports of other essential goods. In that situation, overnight, 47 tons of gold near the Reserve Bank was flown to London on a special charter flight and dumped in the Bank of England, borrowing $ 2.2 billion. Another 20 tons of gold was mined at the Union Bank of Switzerland and another $ 600 million had to be borrowed. The news caused a great stir at the time. Despite all this being done in secret, the van used to transport the gold to the airport burst and stopped on the middle of the road, prompting the police to inform the public that the van was being taken to the airport to be held hostage, with special police being deployed for security at the time. At that time there was no other option but to borrow dollars to pawn gold. The Chandrasekhar government was unable to introduce an annual budget because of the exorbitant fiscal deficit on the other hand due to borrowing from domestic and international institutions and rising interest rates by the then finance minister. The IMF, on the other hand, refused to grant a bail-out package due to non-introduction of the actual budget. On the other hand the arrears to be paid inside and outside the house continue to rise like hills. In fact this is not a problem that came up at the time. Beginning in the 80s and gradually it became a similar situation by the 90s. It\'s the result of a decade of financial mismanagement.\n\nThe big problem facing PV Narasimha Rao, who took over as Prime Minister in June 1991, was to repay the pledged gold and bring it back. Seeing to it that such a situation does not happen again before. None of this is something that happens overnight. Each knot must be untied very patiently. On the other hand he has to protect his minority government which means all this has to happen. PV has heard about Manmohan Singh, who is already a member of the Planning Commission. PV has not yet appointed a finance minister. One day he came out of his office in the Parliament building and was walking in the corridor and suddenly called his aide and told him to come and meet Manmohan Singh. Manmohan Singh, who had already come to the Planning Commission meeting, was in the same building. The matter was told to Manmohan Gary by PV Gary\'s aide so Manmohan came to PV Gary in surprise. Nothing to sit on or the first word PV said to Manmohan Gari while sitting on a small bench in the corridor of Parliament; Manmohan ji wants to appoint you as finance minister whether you are ready. Manmohan Singh replied that I can only give financial advice but not as a politician I do not have the strength to withstand criticism in politics. Instead, I will bear the brunt of the criticism and stoning of you by PV. You do not want that fear. PV assures you that you will not have any trouble unless I take responsibility for what is good or bad. After the meeting which lasted for about 10 minutes, PV appointed Manmohan Singh as the Finance Minister. Gold pledged $ 2.8 billion, half of which was spent by June.\n\nPV Narasimha Rao gave full freedom to Manmohan Singh saying that India should be freed from debt and the economy should be strengthened. That freedom led to economic reforms.\n\n1. On July 1, 1991, the Reserve Bank of India devalued the rupee by 9% against the dollar as a first step. On July 3, the Reserve Bank cut another 3%, or 11% over the three-day period. Just how the response will be is that the Reserve Bank has devalued the rupee in two tranches.\n\n2. There was a good response from the market. The depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has boosted revenues for exporters and the value of exports has begun to rise. This is a good sign but at the same time imports have not declined but the index has stopped rising and remained stable.\n\n3. License Raj system: The license raj system was abolished by Narasimha Rao. Until then, if anyone wants to set up an industry, they need permission from a dozen government agencies.\n\nThe industry needs permission from a dozen government agencies to do so. The same rivals however would not have been an industry box opportunity. Sonia, along with fake Gandhi supporters in Congress, did not like the abolition of the license raj system. This was seen as an impediment to their monopoly. With that, they started conspiring against PV Narasimha Rao within the Congress party. The PV government at the time was in the minority. Opposition groups called for an end to the protests.\n\n4. Gradually foreign direct investment began to grow. But at the same time the BJP Mandir Masjid movement is on a good swing. On the one hand, the BJP has become a problem with its own party trying to oust it.\n\n5. PV Narasimha Rao introduced the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 with the intention of preventing the BJP from improving the country\'s economy. According to the law, places of worship of all religions will remain as they were before independence but will not be allowed to sue in court but will not apply to places of worship under the Archaeological Department. Also, this law does not apply to cases filed in court before it comes into force.\n\n6. PV has done this with the intention that there should be no disruption while restructuring the country‚Äôs economy. No country will come forward to invest in our country when there are religious tensions in the country. The problem we have now with Sri Lanka is that we had it 32 years ago. If not Sri Lanka we have no leader like PV Gary we are comfortable now!\n\n7. Due to the economic reforms introduced by PV Narasimha Rao, our GDP reached $ 266 billion in the financial year 1991-92. We owe $ 2.8 billion in gold. By 2019, our country\'s GDP has reached $ 3 trillion, an increase of 1100 percent. In the case of PPP \\[purchasing power parity\\], it was $ 1 trillion in 1991 and $ 12 trillion by 2019, an increase of 1100%.\n\n8. At present our country\'s foreign exchange reserves are $ 634.287 billion \\[January, 2022\\].\n\n9. The facilities we enjoy in our country today are alms given by PV!\n\n10. Speaking of the Indian economy, it has to be said that it is before PV and after PV.\n\nDon\'t those who have a grudge against the Places of Worship Act 1991 know that our Constitution has already been amended and changed 43 times? Has Article 370 been repealed indefinitely? How long will it take for the BJP government, which has an absolute majority in both the houses, to repeal the Places of Worship Act 1991? That law is essential to the situation in our country as PV takes over as Prime Minister! That law is like Section 144 which is enforced as per the requirement but Section 144 is not applied every 366 days, right?\n\nEven someone who is proficient in 14 languages \u200b\u200bwill say that you have come to your mouth! Deciding to become a dean of the Courtallam in Tamil Nadu after accepting sanity, he approached himself in search of the post of Prime Minister himself while moving his household belongings from Delhi to Hyderabad. Venkanna Swami, whom he always worshiped, accepted the post of Prime Minister thinking of Ajna Kabolu. He performed the task entrusted to him by the Swami as a trinitarian purifier. Would he have had to sell his assets for court costs if he had finally been sued by those in his own right?\n\nPolitics aside .. None .. Can you read and analyze a single page in the poet Samrat Viswanatha Satyanarayana\'s \'\' Vei Padagalu \'\'? If your mother tongue is not Telugu, you can not speak it properly.\n\nDuring a visit to France during PV\'s tenure as Prime Minister, France Television, France\'s national television station, immediately agreed to allow PV to be interviewed. The channel officials set up cameras in the hotel where PV was staying in Paris and set up an interpreter to translate from French into English. PV came and sat in his chair and asked if he could start the interview in French. Plain-spoken, he remained silent for a few seconds as he spoke directly to French television officials in French, doubting whether they could speak English properly, and then applauded. Would you then criticize the great man who greeted the people of France in French and answered the questions in the next interview in French without anyone\'s help?\n\nMy experience:\n\nHis full name is not known but he was known as Joshi Garu in 1991. Joshi is a retired Indian Foreign Service \\[IFS\\] officer. The wife died and the children settled abroad. Introduced in a good deed \\[in 1990\\]. In the first introduction, there was a discussion between us on literature, music as well as current political issues. When I found out that he was a former officer of the Indian Foreign Service, I asked a lot of questions about the reforms \'Glass Nost\' and \'Peristroika\' introduced by President Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. He answered my questions. From then on I used to meet him every time he went to Khairatabad where he was staying.\n\nJoshi is a Maharashtra Brahmin and a Congress fan naturally! I\'m naturally an RSS fan but none of this has hindered our discussions. After the demolition of the Babri Masjid I went to Khairatabad and asked Joshi Gari if PV had failed in the Babri case. Joshi replied, "I put in front of him an article written by India Today on the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Laughing it I had already read Parthasarathy now does not want to read specifically. And I asked him what his analysis was on this, and he said, "Here is an old man from your RSS who is more than my opinion.\n\nThe RSS has Brahmins from various branches of the country like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat but Narasimha Rao, a Telugu representative Brahmin, was the only one to check the rest of the Brahmins in the RSS.\n\nHow?\n\nThe BJP has always been doing something in the name of Ayodhya Rama Mandir but it is important but the time when the movement is in full swing is not good for the country. The country is economically and politically weak. Chanakya\'s morality: Only when the country is prosperous and the people are strong can those people defend their country and culture and fight the enemy strongly. All will be well when the decisions of the king of that country are strict and righteous without prejudice.\n\nPV Gary\'s idea was similar to Chanukya\'s idea then. A problem should not stop until it becomes severe or the severity of the problem should be reduced. Anyway, lakhs of maids reached Ayodhya from all over the country. They had to be fired to keep them in custody but the maids were not in a position to back down for fear of police firing. What is there to do next? The demolition took place. That\'s it! At that time, the BJP had no issue for 25 years! This is the analysis of the 78-year-old RSS veteran! If not he is in Congress that is the only difference!\n\nEven after the demolition of the mosque, the RSS strategists were taught the real thing. That it was no longer gone without any issue in their hands. From 1991 to 2018, that is, until the court verdict on Ayodhya, the BJP went without an important issue. In the meantime, the country has been able to sustain itself economically.\n\nOn the one hand he was rapidly implementing economic reforms while on the other hand he had completed the work required to carry out a second nuclear test and was ready for re-election. If he wins again he will conduct a nuclear test in Pokhran because of the nuclear The code \\[password\\] for the nuclear test was written on a piece of paper and handed over to the new Prime Minister Vajpayee. Credit goes to Vajpayee.\n\nAfter the retirement of PV Narasimha Rao, neither the RSS nor the BJP leaders spoke a word. PV Chanakya has an incomprehensible respect for patriotism to the RSS and the BJP. Does politics mean rising above heights? Work done by PV without causing harm to the country Act of Places of Worship Act 91.\n\nRecently the Supreme Court has made it clear that the law made by PV does not deny the right to determine which religion the place of worship belongs to. The area where the present Kashi Gnanavapi Masjid is located can be ruled out by anyone as the court has not obstructed it by any law.\n\nPV Narasimha Rao is a great man with all the qualifications to hold the court pedestal.

      <li>Title::: 'I had no idea how bad CIA infiltration into China in the 2010s was until today'<br />Body: "So, like any good William Blum-reading leftist, I knew about how the CIA was bad to China in the 1950s. [Arming Tibetan rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Tibetan_uprising), [supporting anti-China drug traffickers illegally occupying another country,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang_in_Burma) AND [potentially trying to assassinate a high-ranking Chinese politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Princess). But I decided to read [this](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/) article today, and good lord let me quote some of the key bits for you.\n\n&gt;Around  2013, U.S. intelligence began noticing an alarming pattern: Undercover  CIA personnel, flying into countries in Africa and Europe for sensitive  work, were being rapidly and successfully identified by Chinese  intelligence, according to three former U.S. officials. The surveillance  by Chinese operatives began in some cases as soon as the CIA officers  had cleared passport control.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In  2010, a new decade was dawning, and Chinese officials were furious. The  CIA, they had discovered, had systematically penetrated their government  over the course of years, with U.S. assets embedded in the military,  the CCP, the intelligence apparatus, and elsewhere. The anger radiated  upward to ‚Äúthe highest levels of the Chinese government,‚Äù  recalled a  former senior counterintelligence executive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Exploiting  a flaw in the online system CIA operatives used to secretly communicate  with their agents‚Äîa flaw first identified in Iran,  which Tehran likely  shared with Beijing‚Äîfrom 2010 to roughly 2012, Chinese intelligence  officials ruthlessly uprooted the CIA‚Äôs human source network in China,  imprisoning and killing dozens of people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Within  the CIA, China‚Äôs seething, retaliatory response wasn‚Äôt entirely  surprising, said a former senior agency official. ‚ÄúWe often had \\[a\\]  conversation internally, on how U.S. policymakers would react to  the  degree of penetration CIA had of China‚Äù‚Äîthat is, how angry U.S.  officials would have been if they discovered, as the Chinese did, that a  global adversary had so thoroughly infiltrated their ranks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  anger in Beijing wasn‚Äôt just because of the penetration by the CIA but  because of what it exposed about the degree of corruption in China. \\[OP  note: this isn't an argument for or against the CPC, since it's been  acknowledged by them to be a serious issue.\\] When the CIA recruits an  asset, the further this asset rises within a county‚Äôs power structure,  the better. During the Cold War it had been hard to guarantee the rise  of the CIA‚Äôs Soviet agents; the very factors that made them vulnerable  to recruitment‚Äîgreed, ideology, blackmailable habits, and ego‚Äîoften  impeded their career prospects. And there was only so much that money  could buy in the Soviet Union,  especially with no sign of where it had  come from.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the time, CIA assets  were often handsomely compensated. ‚ÄúIn the 2000s, if you were a chief  of station‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the top spy in a foreign  diplomatic facility‚Äî‚Äúfor  certain hard target services, you could make a million a year for  working for us,‚Äù said a former agency official.  (‚ÄúHard target services‚Äù  generally refers to Chinese, Russia, Iranian, and North Korean  intelligence agencies.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Over the  course of their investigation into the CIA‚Äôs China-based  agent network,  Chinese officials learned that the agency was secretly paying the  ‚Äúpromotion fees‚Äù ‚Äîin other words, the bribes‚Äîregularly required to rise  up within the Chinese bureaucracy, according to four current and former  officials. It was how the CIA got ‚Äúdisaffected people up in the ranks.  But this was not done once, and wasn‚Äôt done just in the \\[Chinese  military\\],‚Äù recalled a current Capitol Hill staffer. ‚ÄúPaying their  bribes was an example of long-term thinking that was extraordinary for  us,‚Äù said a former senior counterintelligence official. ‚ÄúRecruiting  foreign military officers is nearly impossible. It  was a way to exploit  the corruption to our advantage.‚Äù At the time, ‚Äúpromotion fees‚Äù  sometimes ran into the millions of dollars, according to a former senior  CIA official: ‚ÄúIt was quite amazing the level of corruption that was  going on.‚Äù The compensation sometimes included paying tuition and board  for children studying at expensive foreign universities, according to  another CIA officer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 2013  leaks from Edward Snowden, which revealed the NSA‚Äôs deep penetration of  the telecommunications company Huawei‚Äôs China-based servers, also jarred  Chinese officials, according to a  former senior intelligence analyst.  ‚ÄúChinese officials were just beginning to learn how the internet and  technology has been so thoroughly used against them, in ways they didn‚Äôt  conceptualize until  then,‚Äù the former analyst said. ‚ÄúAt the  intelligence level, it was  driven by this fundamental \\[revelation\\]  that, ‚ÄòThis is what we‚Äôve been  missing: This internet system we didn‚Äôt  create is being weaponized against us.‚Äô‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For  U.S. intelligence personnel, these new capabilities made China‚Äôs  successful hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that  much more chilling. During the OPM breach, Chinese hackers stole  detailed, often highly sensitive personnel data from 21.5 million  current and former U.S. officials, their spouses, and job applicants,  including health, residency, employment, fingerprint, and financial  data. In some cases, details from background investigations tied to the   granting of security clearances‚Äîinvestigations that can delve deeply   into individuals‚Äô mental health records, their sexual histories and  proclivities, and whether a person‚Äôs relatives abroad may be subject to  government blackmail‚Äîwere stolen as well. Though the United States did  not disclose the breach until 2015, U.S. intelligence officials became  aware of the initial OPM hack in  2012, said the former  counterintelligence executive. (It‚Äôs not clear precisely when the  compromise actually happened.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  Chinese now had unprecedented insight into the workings of the  U.S.  system. The United States, meanwhile, was flying with one eye closed  when dealing with China. With the CIA‚Äôs carefully built network of  Chinese agents utterly destroyed, the debate over how to handle China   would become increasingly contentious‚Äîeven as China‚Äôs ambitions grew.\n\nIf you're curious about another western-Asian spying thing, check this out: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia-East\\_Timor\\_spying\\_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%E2%80%93East_Timor_spying_scandal)"<br />Author: 'laundry_writer'  id: 'uuly7o'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uuly7o/i_had_no_idea_how_bad_cia_infiltration_into_china/</li>

These three nations could be easily described as the most egregious sponsors of worldwide Islamic terrorism (INPO) . Thus naturally making his main adversaries India , Israel &amp; Saudi Arabia (INPO) . To get an idea of his motives , one needs to carefully analyse his base of operations and his target market  . While his initial base and target where the Brits , more recently with the advent of Trump his operations have moved to the United States . He recently left his previous employer the Qatari based and funded Al Jazeera and has now moved to the liberal leaning American based  MSNBC . But wherever he worked , his main messaging has mostly been more or less the same . To target the so called "Islamaphobia" and fight it wherever he sees it . And he recently seems to have added some like minded folks like Hassan Minaj to his coiterie . The target being more or less the same - to battle "Islamaphobia" . But Mehdi to no one\'s surprise has gone to defend through association , extreme Islamists . Be it the Muslim Brotherhood , Hamas or Al-Qaida he has always been the first one to defend them . Though , cunningly . His close associated acts - Ilhan Omar , Linda Sarsour and Rashida Tlaib point to the same . While these are the most high profile associates there are several more we can get to in the future . He also has ties to Islamic terrorist affiliated organizations like CAIR which is an un indicted conspirator of the largest terror financing case in U.S history . CAIR to this very day also continues to support Hamas and ISIS terrorists to the present day . While CAIR mostly works in the United States , their partners also have presence in other Western nations like Canada , Germany , Italy , United Kingdom &amp; France . It is high time Hindu groups prepare a fight against these organisations . While RSS already operates internationally , with their primary base being in the US . Thier operations in other regions leaves room for growth . Their activities in other nations are highly scattered - this leaves them vulnerable to outside forces . The other vulnerability being that RSS can only do so much . Hindu groups need to build ties with like minded organisations in the West . We need to fight on several fronts - Either politically , through media warfare or throught the arts . Our predecessors have already done the heavy lifting for us . It is now our responsibility to expand the base .'<br />Author: 'dingusfisherr'  id: 'uuh9l4'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uuh9l4/mehdi_hassan_the_fraud_exposed_also_how_to/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Review of Chicken and Biryani after a life of pure vegetarian for ~ 1 year'<br />Body: 'For over 1 year I have been a vegetarian, mostly because people around me are mostly vegetarian. I was too busy and haven\'t had much time to go visit restaurants outside and eat. So its more than an year that I haven\'t touched any non-veg. So recently I had chicken, Gongoora Chicken at one of the most popular places in Tirupathi called "The Village Firewood Biryani". I, and lots of people rate this better than Blue Fox or Bhima\'s Paradise. And then I had Egg Biryani at one of the most popular places near my home, which many reckon is the best and much better than anywhere you get in Tirupathi city.\n\nSo here is my review.\n\nGongoora chicken is quite tasty, there is no doubt. But after taste and after "smell" after each bite felt bad. It like the smell of blood hitting back into your mouth. I don\'t think I felt like this earlier when I used to have Chicken or meat every other day. So the experience is really ruined with every bite. And I had to atste achar (pickle) often to quell the discomfort. And add to it, the sight of bones was pretty uncomfortable. So I don\'t think I had more than 25% of it. I called my cousin and asked him if he\'d want it. He replied yes and I dropped the pack at his home.\n\nAnd then two days ago, I had Egg Biryani. Even this experience isn\'t that good. Even with egg, I didn\'t like the after taste of yolk and also some weird kind of smell. It was off-putting. The Biryani was quite tasty tough. But then it quickly got boring. Look here you are eating a lump of rice, with curd raita and some gravy as sides. After a few bites, the taste became monotonous. OK, I think this will need explanation.\n\nCompare this with a regular Andhra Thali. You\'d have cucumber dal (doskai papu), Tomato dal (papu), bhindi fry, few pickles (avkai, gongura, lemon), podi (2-3 types), papad (andhra papads are very different), a sweet, pickled mirch, pulusu ... quite a few I miss. Its a bomb of spectrum of tastes exploding in your mouth for every bite. In other words "taste density" per bite/morsel is extremely high with Andhra Thali. With both Gongoora chicken and Biryani, the "marginal" taste in your mouth decreases with every next bite/morsel of the food.\n\nOne of the best rice dishes one can have IMO is Tirumala style chitranna or lemon/tamarind rice. When you visit Balaji temple in Tirumala, you get different varieties of prasad and one of them is chitranna. Eating it is, I\'d say, is an emotion. You can taste number of spices which mutually congruent with every bite. If you draw hypothetical engg drawing projections of this, it would contain multiple orthogonal views of -  "Sambar rice", "Rasam rice", "Puliogare", Bisibele bath, curry leaves podi (karvipaku podi), cooked turmeric, some elachi, cloves and even some mustard. It\'s a one of a kind of a preparation. And having it on the Tirumala hills out in open with cool breeze flowing over your face is just an amazing experience. \n\nI think my conversion into a vegetarian is complete.'<br />Author: 'blackrock-orange'  id: 'uuglbm'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uuglbm/review_of_chicken_and_biryani_after_a_life_of/</li>

Slogans of\xa0 ‚ÄúSimon Go Back‚Äù rent the air, and black flags were shown wherever the commission members entered. With Mumbai being the epicenter of the protests, the British Government banned any strikes, demonstrations all over the country.\xa0 Considering the rather explosive situation, the Government banned all protests, rallies in Chennai. However a large crowd, gathered at Parry‚Äôs Corner, opposite the Madras High Court, and began to chant slogans of ‚ÄúSimon Go Back‚Äù. The police fired on the crowd, to disperse them. A youngster named Parthasarathi, fell a victim to the firing, and his lifeless body was lying on the square. The police warned that that anyone trying to carry the corpse, would also be similarly shot dead.\n\nWhen the crowd was scared, one man stopped in with an imposing physique, sharp eyes, to take the body. As the police turned their guns towards him, he tore open his shirt in fury, bared his chest to them. And in a loud voice, roared , ‚ÄúShoot you cowards, if you have any guts‚Äù, his chest bared to the police guns. The police taken aback by the defiance, and understanding the situation, gave way to him. That act of courage and defiance earned\xa0 that man, the appellation of ‚ÄúAndhra Kesari‚Äù( The Lion of Andhra).\n\nThat man was **Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu**, one of the great freedom fighters from Andhra Pradesh, and also the first Chief Minister of the newly created Andhra State.\n\nMy article on his death anniversary today, do check out to know more about his life.\n\n[https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/andhra-kesari/](https://historyunderyourfeet.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/andhra-kesari/)'<br />Author: 'LoneWolfInCyberia'  id: 'utkuib'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/utkuib/andhra_kesari/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'My problems with India, today.'<br />Body: ' \n\nJust a rant to get this out of my head.\n\nI\'m a Hindu, and I want to preserve my culture and heritage because I recognise the several positive aspects of my culture and I don\'t want them to lose as a result of time and actions committed against it in the past, or today to malign and defame it.\n\nHowever, this is not what my communities so-called leaders call for when they talk about preserving Hinduism and Indian culture. I understand how these 2 topics are entangled, but to me, I believe that our nationalism is perceived best when it comes solely to the love of our nation, and not through the means of religion (more on this).\n\nI\'ve heard constant yapping from these leaders saying Mughals destroyed several temples and how Hindus today are second-class citizens in their own country. Also about the replacement theories, etc. So they go and rally in front of mosques, etc. They also talk about how many mosques are popping up in places where there didn\'t use to be mosques.\n\nMy questions to these leaders (and I know they won\'t answer, so if you align yourself with them, please feel free to quote me statistics):\n\n1. How many temples did you construct, or rather, even lay foundations too, in 2021?\n2. How many litigations did you enter, asking for reparations of broken temples in 2021?\n3. How many people did you teach the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata in 2021? How many people, aside from CBSE students, learnt Sanskrit? How many people were taught about the knowledge preserved in our ancient texts?\n4. How many times in your rallies did you ask your followers to prepare for a race war and called for pre-emptive strikes, making you no better than the people you claim to be a threat to you?\n\nNow, some of my questions to the people in general (regardless of their political alignment). Please note that my intention behind these questions isn\'t malicious, rather it is just in my nature to question things that are widely accepted.\n\n1. Why is a Hijab, which is most definitely a patriarchial tool employed to hold women back, (same idea as the ghoonghat) being supported? Even though we might say that "it\'s a woman\'s choice to wear a hijab" the conservatives will only employ the same logic to push women down. Isn\'t it a paradox that we\'re demanding the same thing as the conservatives who say that a woman should act modestly and always wear a hijab? Even though our notions are different, the result remains the same.\n2. Despite all the fanaticism on the right and the left, when a matter goes to court, don\'t both parties have the right to be heard? Just as the right does, I\'ve seen a lot of early dismissals by the left of the opposite argument. How can we call ourselves better if we employ the same ignorance as they do? Of course, our take on the arguments is different, at times more valid and relevant, and I don\'t mean to say that one should tolerate hate speech, but in civil discourse, meh, just doesn\'t come off great.\n3. How often are our arguments constructive? How often have you seen a political debate, be it among politicians or between two friends or even between a parent and their kid? Our political debates are always about who caused what issue. It\'s never about the actions that either side or any party is undertaking for resolving particular issues. It\'s those things that we should be truly debating about. The approach to the issue. That\'s what the political spectrum is the basis of. A particular group of people\'s approach to specific issues. Do you as an individual engage in constructive debates, or do you too descend into chaotic arguments that lead nowhere?\n\nNow I know these questions are very pin-pointy, but this is what I had on my mind. Given that it\'s a Wednesday night, I\'m hoping that the small number of people who really see this understand that these aren\'t things to comment about immediately. While typing this post\'s draft, I\'ve questioned my own biases, and I\'m going to continue to do so until I feel enlightened about these things. You can save this post and come back when you feel like you\'ve got answers, or you could maybe just use these questions to think about your own ideas of Indian politics.\n\nAll I know is that I feel a lot lighter sharing these thoughts and questions with this sub.'<br />Author: 'AZstuff36'  id: 'usl6m8'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/usl6m8/my_problems_with_india_today/</li>

As you all know that Anthony Blinken (state secretary of USA)commented on the Hanumanpuri incident that they are concerned about Human Rights violation in India, and S Jaishankar gave a befitting reply to him saying that he is also concerned. In my opinion this response couldn\'t have been any better, but what Foreign Minister implied was that he was concerned about hate crimes committed on Indian origin people (at that time a Sikh man was beaten by an African American man).\n\nIt seems like some Indians have taken it personally, and took it to extreme. You will find comments like "As an Indian I am concerned about Human Rights violation in USA". And for some reason I find it annoying . \n\nHere\'s my opinion about America and believe me when I say that I don\'t particularly love or hate America, Imo it\'s a beautiful country just like ours and others, and if they have problem within them good luck for them solving it. And as far as their international dominance is concerned, Indian diplomacy will act accordingly to serve their interest.\n\nSo after the buffalo shooting the entire US is mourning, the least one can show is empathy and offer condolences. But no, even at this time some naive people have to play petty politics, commenting about the concern they have for US. Even if you have concern about the human rights in USA then why don\'t you show it in the form empathy rather than mocking them. Even Blinken was ready to shed some fake tears.\n\n Remember when the Boeing incident happened 2 months ago, the entire Rajya Sabha observed silence in order to give Chinese people their condolences, even though India-China relations are at all time low.\n \nThe thing is some Indians have a toxic relationship with America.

I want my kids to be like me and grow up with my culture at-least till they reach 22\n\n3) I see this leave India as a sheep race , like IIT when we were 17 , where people just go because others go and is more related to status rather than passion because I clearly know I would be the same mediocre guy there too and if I were to change I would change here too and would receive more benefits as I would have more access to a business/startup here in Bangalore than in Chicago etc, my cousins are Directors and MDs to IT companies in their 30s , which I think will be impossible in USA and all.

My background is in design; I design products, cars, buildings, and so on, and I believe that modification is an art form in and of itself; you must have a certain ability to see things in a different way to create those modifications because modification tells a story about the owner, their background, their creative mindset, and so on.\n\nI am aware of those who intend to attack me. I understand the drawbacks of it being a public nuisance or whatever, but it's really like limiting yourself from being your creative self. For an artist, it can be a canvas, but for others, it's their cars or bikes that inspire them to do their work. If you look at western countries or even countries in Asia like Thailand or Japan, the reason why they have amazing car or bike designers is because certain levels of modification are encouraged, people go out of their way to do it.\n\nPeople who are creative are willing to put their creative ideas to work and create something wonderful.

You are building this country with your tax money and in return you get NOTHING in return, the taxes you pay today are being used to fuck you over in the future &lt;3 if you arent mad about this, then you should be, nothing else matters, cars, phones, stocks, cash, the numbers in your bank account, everything is superficial and more of it can be made. Land is limited, they cant make more of it, and you dont own any of it.\n\nbtw before anyone thinks im being bitter because i am poor, nah, i am set to inherit a lot of property in major parts of the city and i am in the process of acquiring acres of agriculture land in the outskirts of my city with my own money but the whole thing has opened my eyes, how fucked up the system is and how fucked over the tax payers really are. Something has to change, someone has to empower the tax payers of this country, the tax payers have to stand up for themselves, and that is only possible when we start planting these ideas in tax payer's minds.

      <li>Title::: "An Indian-American's opinion of the Indian boy's harassment in an American public school."<br />Body: 'Little backstory about me: I used to live in Portland, Oregon, a city in northwest USA until I moved to India for my 11th grade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing through the posts about the Indian boy getting bullied by a white kid in highschool, one can see that there is a lot of unintelligent and boisterous hate towards unrelated issues in the US. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, bullying happens everywhere and to anyone. There are so many more videos of indian kids getting bullied a lot worse, but it doesnt look this subreddit cares about it unless it fits their agenda. It happens to all kinds of kids from chinese to blacks to whites (yes white) and us, indians. In my own experience, there used to be a small group of black students who would bully a white kid with glasses and a scrawny build, no one did anything about it. After awhile it got to much for him and he started to spiral into depression, a few of my friends and I were kind of close with him and we were able to force our principal to take drastic measures to stop the harrasment. So yes, ANYONE can bully and be bullied irrespective a gender, religion or race. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo Indians do not face racism on a daily basis, you would be surprised that the US is very racially diverse, unlike india. Here racism is going to be prevalent in any way, when there are so many different races. There are large communities of Indians that publicly celebrate Indian holidays, some schools that were in m district used to acknowledge diwali and give a holiday on that day. If someone finds better opportunities in another country, whats stopping them from going, just one video of an Indian kid does not mean the country is specifically intolerant to Indians, no it does not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing, bullying like that does not mean they will become a school shooter. (WTF) How can someone say this if they only follow news on MSM? MSM is always going to provide the craziest, most dangerous and horrible crimes commited on their shows, they wouldnt want to broadcast something that shows a better view of another country. Yes, I agree that school shootings are a serious problem in the US and it should be taken care of at utmost urgency, but its not a commonplace thing, a lot of happens gets overtly exaggerated and the country is as big as Europe. If you were someone who lived in the UK would you be so worried to not live in your country if a crime like that occured in greece?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my own experience, I was never bullied in school. One of Indian friends used to get bullied by a chinese kid in middle school, but after telling the principal, he was expelled. Many public schools are not as corrupt as shown on MSM, a lot of them do better than high ranking schools for free.  I would go so far as to say students India are more brutal at bullying for my indian-american accent than the people I have met in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to tell you that I am an avid lover of the country of India, I love this country for what it is and I believe that we as a country can do a lot better as a whole. But at the same time, its heart breaking to see hate to another country that also has so many beautiful things, not just what MSM deliver to their international audience.'<br />Author: 'SiRex750'  id: 'urk361'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/urk361/an_indianamericans_opinion_of_the_indian_boys/</li>

I did my research on internet and figured that I was manipulated since day 1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said many things like "I talk to you because you are young and I am selfish, do you have rape fantasy, are you really young because you sound older than your age, you look maal/item bomb, implied I run sex business and asked for discount, ridiculed my career and called me cheap whore/bitch, would put me down so that I would try to prove myself to him, said I would have stopped talking to you already if you were no  funny - so I started telling him a lot of jokes due to fear of abandonment, he hid his relationship from me until I asked, said things like aapne nasha kar diya vash mein karne wala, I feel like your owner, want to punish you, you give off slave vibes; i used to tell him my problems and seek advice - he would manipulate things in his favour; he coerced me ro date him by saying things like I have firmly expectations; he shamed me for not being able to drink/smoke because I lived with my parents." \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou would wonder what was I doing when he abused me? I was really funny and talkative. I had a history of mental illnesses that I had told him about like maladaptive  daydreaming, extreme mood swings and later figured out I had BPD and depression. I used to think that I was "mind reader" and had cognitive distortions. At that time I thought I could not do better than that. He pretended to be my caregiver and quoted philosophy to look intellectual. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is neither poly nor open; he does this to many other young girls by fooling them with buzzwords. He is 35 now and admitted to dating very young girls only. Later he started gaslighting me, did not acknowledge anything and blocked me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to see read other people\'s opinions on incidents like these. I have healed from this trauma and everything else.'<br />Author: 'HelpAccidentIndia'  id: 'uriqh8'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uriqh8/i_was_groomed_abused_and_manipulated_by_a_phd/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Some Info about Indian kid being bullied at Texas!'<br />Body: "#Plot of Incident -\n\nOn Wednesday, May 11th, during lunch, Shaan Pritmani was physically attacked and choked by another student at his middle school. The school called his parents and informed them that their son had been in an altercation with another student. The school stated that the victim (Shaan) was at fault and received a 3-day ISS, while the aggressor only received a 1-day ISS.\nShaan's friends shared the video of the assault with parents and reached out to inform them that Shaan wasn't at fault. Shaan's parents reached out to school authorities, shared the evidence and requested a reassessment. The school informed the parents that they have seen the video and that there will be no change in the course of action. The Coppell ISD SRO officer refused to file a citation because school administration asked it not be written, as there have been too many bullying complaints lately. \xa0The Coppell PD also dropped the ball. The parents tried in vain for over 2 hours to get a complaint filed, but were refused.\nShaan's aggressor in the video is on the wrestling team and can be seen carrying out a very dangerous carotid restraint on Shaan's neck. This technique restricts blood flow to a person's brain by compressing the sides of the neck where the carotid arteries are located. Shaan appears to briefly lose consciousness at the end of the neck choke maneuver.\xa0\n\n#CALL TO ACTION:\n\nDue to lack of support from the Coppell ISD and Coppell PD to correctly handle this assault, we are demanding that the aggressor be removed from my son's school immediately. \xa0Shaan should never have to take a class, interact, or pass the hallways with this aggressor ever again. \xa0Shaan should be able to continue his school experience, friendships and extra-curricular activities with zero worry of ever having to cross paths with this student again. \xa0He does not feel safe. \xa0\n\n\n\nPlease support the signature campaign petition by someone online - https://www.change.org/p/assaults-at-schools-protect-the-victim\n\n*please it is requested if anyone can support the signature campaign by supporting the victim I did be happy*"<br />Author: 'Deactivated_Channel'  id: 'ure6gg'<br />Score:613<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ure6gg/some_info_about_indian_kid_being_bullied_at_texas/</li>

Entirely self created fiasco by all state pillars which is pushing Pakistan down the road SriLanka is treading today.\n \nNo one is in charge in the country right now.\nNot the so called political govt nor the GHQ nor the Supreme Court or the ousted IK. There is a power tussle which has sent the country &amp; its economy as well as governance into a tailspin.\nIt is complete confusion &amp; fog of war..\n \nThere is total panic in the Shahbaz Shareef govt. Their coalition partner Zardari has played a fast one on them, handing over the controls of the country to the Mafia house of Shareef knowing that they cannot handle the political &amp; economic mess created after the ouster of IK\n \nNow, the PM SS is in a crisis. He cannot run the govt. He cannot dissolve the parliament. He cannot go for the elections. He cannot let IK win but cannot control the crash himself. If he goes for the elections, the angry voters will surely vote for IK. PMLN cannot risk it.\n \n**Gen Bajwa is also facing an unprecedented crisis** himself in the last few months of his Command. Not just that the country is in turmoil &amp; the image &amp; respect of the army is hugely dented within the nation for the first time since 1971, his own person is under attack from PTI.\n \nSince 2018, when the army brought IK into power, PTI was the only party supporting Army in the national discourse.\nNow when GQB is seen by PTI as instrumental in ousting them from power, **Army is all alone &amp; getting bashed.**\nPMLN &amp; PPP are actually enjoying this army bashing.\n \n**This is a geopolitical &amp; historical fact that if Pakistan is staying united as nation state, it is because of a very strong nationalist army which had always pride itself in guarding the ideological &amp; geographic boundaries of the country &amp; was always loved by the nation.**\n \n**The biggest damage done to Pakistan in this crisis is that this core belief about Army being the custodian of the last resort has been violently shaken, sending earthquake into the very foundations of the state &amp; eroded the blind trust nation had on the institution.**\n \nSo now practically all political parties are against the army. Some openly, some pretending to be allies, yet enjoying the humiliation of the army leadership &amp; the institution.\nSerious &amp; rather desperate damage control measures are being taken by GHQ but headwind is v strong.\n\n\n**IK on the other hand is also clueless on what to do next.** His only demand is fresh elections within the same system, with the same failed team he had but this time without military support. He believes that he can force the pol govt &amp; GHQ to go for early elections.\n \nHe is upping the ante against the GQB directly &amp; military leadership in his speeches. Throwing camouflaged yet dangerous signs that "powers" are trying to get him eliminated. He believes that center of gravity still lies in GHQ &amp; they should be brought under pressure.\n\nIf there was a desire to remove IK by the US, the same powers have not shown confidence in his replacement either. The PMLN/PPP led coalition is seen to be too weak, corrupt &amp; facing extreme hostile reaction that no international power is willing to deal with them.\n \nThe economy is spiraling out of control. Inflation has gone through the roof. Rupee is devaluing rapidly, fuel prices are rising &amp; food is getting out of reach of ordinary man. Then the massive public resistance being given by IK is now creating serious doubts in GHQ &amp; PMLN.\n \nWhy is PMLN is not going for early elections despite knowing fully well that they have lost control &amp; country is crashing &amp; that soon their ministers may be dragged on streets SriLankans?\n\nIts the desire to appoint the next Army Chief. Every party want their man in GHQ.\n \nAnd this is the reason for IK to push for early elections. He also want to appoint his favorite General as the next Army chief. Present chief retires in November. Before that in October, many top Generals will retire &amp; the sitting COAS will decide future leaders of army.\n \nWho gets to appoint the next army chief is the real battle being contested between IK &amp; PMLN right now. That is why IK is in a hurry to go for elections, being sure that he will win &amp; become PM again &amp; thus appoint the next COAS in Nov.\nSS wants to drag elections after Nov.\n \nThis ONE desire &amp; contest to appoint the next Army Chief is tearing the country apart right now. As the time passes, IK is getting impatient &amp; raising the temperatures. SS govt is equally desperate, using more &amp; more harsh measures to contain the rising popularity of IK.\n \nThere is a global economic crash in the making &amp; the busted supply chain is disrupting the entire planet but the problems in Pakistan are magnified due to political chaos &amp; the state being clueless &amp; headless for all purposes.\nOnly chaos comes out of this bitter struggle.\n \n**So what next?**\n\nThere are two state organs who can still act as arbitrators in this self created madness. SC &amp; GHQ.\nSC has decided to distance itself &amp; is silently watching the state collapse.\nGHQ is in firefighting mode, defending itself more under very hostile fire...\n \nFor now, all sides, GHQ, Govt, IK.. are playing mind games....increasing pressure on the other, hoping they blink first. But this confrontation is rapidly raising the temperatures within the country &amp; opening the gates of civil disobedience &amp; in worst case urban war.\n \nBefore the situation gets totally out of hand &amp; the country slips into SriLanka styled anarchy, GHQ or the SC will have to step in decisively.\nPresent govt to be dissolved, a neutral caretaker govt to be installed &amp; dates of elections be announced. This would cool things.\n \nStill, even if the GHQ/SC decide to intervene in larger national interest, there are still many external wild cards at play which can explode the already explosive situation.\n**A new wave of terrorism...food &amp; fuel shortages....Indian invasion....everything is coming anyways.**\n \nNext few weeks will basically decide the fate of the country.

Getting a job is similar in the the umbilical cord attached to your parents is finally severed and you\'re finally on your own in the world.\n\nThis is also the first time people start contributing to society and transform from a resource hog to a productive member.\n\nBut a lot of this experience is spent whiling away one\'s money and youth with bad financial practises atleast for a few years before better sense prevails. Also living with parents being the norm, the effects of the said "independence" are limited or rather protected with no worries about food and housing in most cases. That is relegated to when the kids marry. I will not dwell on this further and come right to the question.\n\n**What would be your suggestion for people who have newly joined the work force ?**\n\n**With respect to finances and societal changes to be made**\n\nAs for me -\n\nA few things I learnt on the way, but you can say I am still in a fresher mindset, due to CoVID related time dilation :\n\nBeing a doctor my financial sense is a mess. I made no savings in the past couple of years. Don\'t know much about investments and hence most of my money just sits in the bank. Which is bad practise as I have learnt now, since you tend to spend it.\n\nI always believed that a car was the worst purchase you can ever make but owing to Delta CoVID last year, I panicked and spent most of my savings and bought a car, above my capacity.\n\nI also ironically do not have health or life insurance and cannot choose between the options available. Nor can I afford one right now but I am trying to save up for that.\n\nDue to CoVID and the inherent risk for both my wife and me, working under such conditions, there was a good chance we wouldn\'t have made it; this changed our mindset from a savings oriented one to living with what we have. Ended up spending most of our savings in the past few months and we are starting afresh for all intents and purposes.\n\nI know terms like "diversity your portfolio" but it doesn\'t make any sense to me. I only know of FD and Shares. But not much beyond that.\n\nAll this poor planning is not a great burden for us now, but it has pushed us to expand our family well into the 30s and the fear of giving our kids a good future, makes buying a car and all the excess travels feel like an unnecessary frivolous expense.\n\nWe as a household make a combined Rs. 2.3 lakhs and our expenditure is usually around 1 lakh per month. Most of what we save ends up in unnecessary expenditure so I want to park it somewhere.\n\nAny advise is appreciated'<br />Author: '11docdoctor11'  id: 'uqqnev'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uqqnev/suggestion_for_new_workforce_bees_from_veterans/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Few tips to stay relatively safe in India based on my experience'<br />Body: 'Sharing some tips to reduce your risk:\n\n1. Avoid being on the road on early Saturday and Sunday mornings - lot of drunken drivers are on the road (from late night parties)\n\n2. Walk on the side of the road opposing the traffic so you can see the oncoming traffic - reduce risk of being robbed from behind\n\n3. If you see two bike born men, with pillion also wearing a helmet, strangely roaming around, quickly find a safe spot (like the guard room of a nearby apartment). Most stuff happens early morning or during hot afternoons or chilly winter evenings.\n\n4. Never ever, leave your children alone with anyone outside of your immediate family. Especially for girl child, never leave them alone with uncles, house helps or even cousins.\n\n5. Pick up your kids from the school or on the deboarding point. Ask them about their day every day. \n\n6. Never drive during foggy mornings - the probability of accident goes up quite a bit\n\n7. Never fall asleep in a taxi and always keep your GPS on. Keep your doors locked. \n\n8. Never engage in road rage. Don‚Äôt look angrily or use cuss words at other drivers\n\n9. Never click on any link received in SMS and always check the URL when you need to enter password or personal details\n\n10. Don‚Äôt post pictures of your wife or kids to public platforms - miscreants download these pictures, morph them and use them for pretty crazy stuff on the dark web\n\n11. If someone calls you to an isolated place to meet, insist on meeting at a crowded public place and never give in\n\n\n12. Don‚Äôt hang out at abandoned parks and buildings, especially with your GF etc\n\n\n13. Carry pepper spray, even if you are a guy. But more importantly, practice using it every week. \n\n\n14. Change all your passwords every month and set up two factor authentication \n\n15. Never ever, in any circumstance, give your credit card expiry and CvV or OTP to everyone, even if you‚Äôve already lost money and they insist that they need it to refund you\n\n16. Get a psychographic test done on your maid/servant/driver. \n\n17. Install CCTV in your living room and front door. Ensure they are secured a your cam can‚Äôt be hacked \n\n18. The drinks at clubs and even reputed bars are almost always mixed with cheap stuff. Best is to buy cans and drink at home\n\n19. Restaurants don‚Äôt optimize for hygiene or health,they optimize for taste and profits. Minimise eating outside, especially non. Veg\n\n20. Don‚Äôt take personal loans from individuals or non banks\n\n21. If possible, try gargling with RO water. Most people don‚Äôt realise, but they fall sick from swallowing water while gargling or rinsing their mouth with tap water. Just go see your water tank once and you‚Äôll never put that water in your mouth \n\n24. Whenever you are driving or walking on the street, put your phone on no disturb mode \n\n25. Be wary of guys who seem too confident and seem like they got it. (Bhai sambhaal lega types). Never depend on them\n\n26. Don‚Äôt try adventure sports in India and other developing countries. They don‚Äôt follow security guidelines and operate by paying bribes. They maximise for profits and not for your safety\n\n27. Now that it isn‚Äôt awkward to wear masks, wear masks in public transport, malls etc. In India, TB is quite prevalent, but it‚Äôs not talked about as much\n\n29. Avoid participating in bataya when you need to dance on roads and highways\n\n30. Get yourself a full body checkup every 6 months and get online consultation. Based on the report\n\n31. If you ever feel rage or anger, just try to see the funny side of it, how funny you look. Most people ruin their lives in anger or rage \n\n32. Divide your money in 2-3 bank accounts so bank employees don‚Äôt get a clear sense of your net worth. Yes, they sell your information to all kinds of people\n\n33. Your maid or driver might not understand english, but they pickup keywords\n\n34. Never ever confide in your friends or relatives about the problems in your relationships, unless you are a victim of domestic abuse\n\n35. If you feel your sister or daughter might be a subject of domestic abuse, your most likely true you should tRy to rescue them asap\n\n36.

Even now, whenever I visit Delhi, I make sure to go worship at Gurudwara Shri bangla saheb. However, recent calls for Khalistan have really soured my relations with the religion. I feel like India can't survive without Sikhism and that we would lose a huge chunk of our culture if Khalistan was to become a reality.

But the norms that seemed attractive to an oppressed but backward people in Arabia at a time of civil strife should not be accepted as eternal; make a habit of sticking to only what is relevant in the modern age.\n\nOh Muslims! Just think what the Europeans reduced you to after they escaped from the clutches of the Bible, to master the sciences that are beneficial for our times. You were pushed out of Spain, you were subjected to massacres, and you were crushed in Austria, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria. Your control over Mughal India was snatched away. They are ruling you in Arabia, Mesopotamia, Iraq and Syria.\nJust as our yajnas, prayers, Vedas, holy books, penances, curses could not harm the Europeans, so too will your Quran, martyrdoms, namaz, religious lockets make no difference to them. Just as the maulvis sent armies to war in the belief that the men who fought under the banner of Allah would never lose, so did our pundits peacefully sit back to repeat the name of Rama a million times. But none of this prevented the Europeans. With their advanced weapons, they not only decimated the Muslim armies, but they even toyed with the fallen flag of Allah.\n\nAnd that is why Mustafa Kemal Ataturk has broken the bonds of all religious laws that have kept the Turkish nation backward. He has borrowed civil law, criminal law and military law from Switzerland, France and Germany, to replace the rules in the Quran. The literal meaning of what is said in the Quran no longer matters. The only question today is what is essential for national advancement in the light of modern science. Turkey can hold its own against Europe today because Kemal has given primacy to modern science in his nation. If Turkey had remained bound within the covers of the Quran, as it was during the reign of Kemal Sultan or the Khalifa, the Turks would still be licking the boots of the Europeans, as the Indian Muslims are doing today. If they want to advance as the Turks have done, Indian Muslims should abandon the religious fanaticism that has been nurtured over a thousand years, and accept modern science.\n\n-Savarkar, echoes from the forgotten past, Vikram Sampath'<br />Author: 'PhysicistAmar'  id: 'uqb4zw'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uqb4zw/veer_savarkar_on_modernization_among_muslims/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Gyanvapi Issue: Let's not go into denial mode"<br />Body: 'The excitement over a lower court order ordering a survey of the interiors of the Gyanvapi masjid-a stone\'s throw from the Kashi Vishwanath temple - in Varanasi has invoked concerns over a possible re-run of the Ayodhya dispute that dominated public life for more than three decades. The concerns are understandable, although premature. Although the mosques in Varanasi and Mathura, along with the erst while Babri structure in Ayodhya, are listed by some groups as the three shrines that should be reclaimed for Hindu worship, comparisons with Ayodhya are inexact. First, the legal proceedings over the Ayodhya structure were complemented by a huge popular mobilisation that touched nearly the whole of India. Such a mobilisation is, as yet, both unseen and unplanned. Secondly, while the claim in Ayodhya was for rights over the birthplace of Lord Ram, the dispute in Varanasi is over unrestricted Hindu rights of worship of deities lo cated both on the outer wall of the demolished temple and the inner wall whose access has to be through the mosque. There is, as yet, no demand for the removal of the mosque and the restoration of the status quo ante. Finally, the existence of the Places of Worship Act passed by Parliament in 1991, severely curtails the legal space for those seeking to undo Aurangzeb\'s acts of iconoclasm. The law does not allow any scope for the present religious character of a shrine to be modified. To that extent, the present tussle in Varanasi is aimed at securing greater elbow room for Hindu worshippers.\n\nIn the battle of public perceptions, however, legal proceedings play a minor role. In fact, during the Ayodhya dispute, judicial procrastination became a source of ex asperation. What seems more relevant is that the Gyan vapi controversy could become a starting point for re newed interest in the destruction of Hindu temples from the 11th to the 18th centuries.\n\nBy itself, this preoccupation with history isn\'t detri mental to any nation, not least India where an awareness of the past is at best patchy. India has such a rich surfeit of the past that there is a tendency to take it for granted. What complicates matters further is the marked ten dency of what Arun Shourie once dubbed as \'eminent historians\' to try and tailor the past to suit present-day sensibilities. This wilful falsification played a significant role in not merely prolonging the Ayodhya dispute, but creating an unbridgeable gulf between the intelligentsia and those who saw themselves as proud Hindus. The f rocity of kar sevaks in Ayodhya on December 6, 1991, was shaped by a pent-up desire to show the privileged opinion makers their place. The disingenuous interventions of \'eminent historians\' also fuelled Muslim victimhood and triggered intransigence.\n\nA factor in the Hindu-Muslim fault line that periodically is the conflicting perceptions of history. In the case of the Gyanvapi mosque- popularly so described after the sacred site on which it stands- there should, ide ally, be no disagreement. It is undeniable that in 1669, Aurangzeb demolished the grand Visveshwara (Vishwa nath) temple and built a mosque in its place. The demolished temple, according to Harvard scholar Diana L Eck "was grand in scale and execution, consisting of a central sanctum, the garbha griha, surrounded by eight pavil ions, or mandapas."\n\nThe temple was, however, not fully destroyed. Aurangzeb deliberately kept one wall of the old temple standing and merged it with his more austere shrine. Whether he sought to rub salt in the wounds of Hindus or projected it as a symbol of imperial arrogance is a matter of conjecture. Whatever the reason, the wall ensured that the memories of the destruction remained alive in the form of veneration of the adjoining well in which the Shivlingam had been thrown by a priest, anxious to prevent its desecration, and the worship of a depiction of the goddess Parvati that survived the vandalism. Nearly every pilgrim who has viewed Aurangzeb\'s handiwork in Varanasi has experienced both a sense of loss and profound anger. Left to fester, this could, in the context of a feeling of Hindu empowerment, escalate into a de mand for retribution and trigger other local disputes.\n\nTo merely fall back on the law to regulate public sen timent isn\'t enough. What is also needed is a historical narrative that tells Indians of all communities the honest truth about the ugly medieval inheritance. To fall back on obfuscation and denial often inclined -as secularists are will merely drive Hindu victimhood underground and make it ugly. It will also exclude the intelligentsia from an overdue re-evaluation of India\'s troubled past.\n     \n\n\nAn article by Swapan Dasgupta, Editorial, TOI.'<br />Author: 'Petrosexual_7391'  id: 'upxhnp'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/upxhnp/gyanvapi_issue_lets_not_go_into_denial_mode/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'V. Savarkar thoughts on nationalism is more secular than that of Gandhi and Jinnah.'<br />Body: '"One who considers this vast stretch of land called Bharat\n\nFrom the Sindhu to the Sindhu (Indus to the Seas)\n\nas his fatherland (or land of one‚Äôs ancestors) and holy land\n\nis the one who will be termed and remembered as a Hindu."\n\nIn this definition, there is an implicit challenge to the prevalent Gandhian philosophy of sacrosanct issues such as the Khilafat, going beyond the sacral geography of India by precisely defining its contours‚Äîfrom the Indus to the seas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe social coalition of Hindu religions naturally fulfilled all the criteria postulated by Vinayak. Vinayak‚Äôs hypothesis of identification for a Hindu was someone who looked upon this land of his forefathers as his holy land; someone who inherited the blood of the race of the Sapta Sindhus; and one who expressed a common affinity to the classical language, Sanskrit, someone who shared common history, culture, art, laws, jurisprudence, rites, rituals, ceremonies, sacraments and festivals. Common nation (rashtra), common race (jati) and common culture (sanskriti) were the definitive markers of Hindutva. But the construct was a secular paradigm as it distanced itself from religions, including Hinduism. He imagined the Indian nation as a spatial unity that linked distinct communities, regions and territories under the broad rubric of Hindu identity. Within that space of the primordial Hindu nation, the state must defend the integrity and sovereignty of the sacred motherland (Bharat Mata) from all foreign encroachment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"For though Hindusthan to them is Fatherland as to any other Hindu, yet it is not to them a Holy land too. Their holy land is far off in Arabia or Palestine. Their mythology and Godmen, ideas and heroes are not the children of this soil. Consequently their names and their outlook smacks of a foreign origin. Their love is divided. Nay, if some of them be really believing what they profess to do, then there can be no choice‚Äîthey must, to a man, set their Holy land above their father land \\[sic\\] in their love and allegiance. That is but natural. We are not condemning nor are we lamenting. We are simply telling the facts as they stand."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut did this definition preclude the Muslims and Christians from being a part of the ‚ÄòHindutva‚Äô fold? Here, Vinayak seems to contradict his own hypothesis by saying anyone can make it a ‚Äòmatter of choice‚Äô to love ‚ÄòHindu‚Äô culture and the land and thereby qualify to be a part of the fold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"Are you a monist‚Äîa monotheist‚Äîa pantheist‚Äîan atheist‚Äîan agnostic? Here is ample room, oh soul! Whatever thou art, to love and grow to thy fullest height and satisfaction in this temple of Temples . . . Ye, who by race, by blood, by culture, by nationality possess almost all the essentials of Hindutva . . . ye have only to render whole hearted \\[sic\\] love to our common Mother and recognize her not only as Pitribhu but even as a Punyabhu and ye would be most welcome to the Hindu-fold. This is a choice, which our countrymen and our old kith and kin, the Bohras, Khojas, Mamons, and other Mohamedan and Christian communities are free to make‚Äîa choice again which must be a choice of love."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNationalism was simplified to a choice to love and express that love, monogamously, towards one‚Äôs country. This was the highest form of love against which all other variations between humans appeared to pale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"Hindutva was a political argument made in a poetic register. It was an argument with and against an unnamed Gandhi at an opportune moment when he seemed finished with politics. Hindutva was also a political cry from behind prison walls, reminding the larger world outside that even if Gandhi was no longer on the political scene, Savarkar was back. He was still a leader, a politician capable of pulling together a nationalist community. But unlike Gandhi, he was offering a sense of Hinduness that could be the basis for a more genuine and, in the end, more effective nationalism than that of the Mahatma. The startling change for its time was Savarkar‚Äôs assertion that it was not religion that made Hindus Hindu. If Gandhi had officiated at the marriage of religion and politics, and Khilafat leaders were using the symbols of religion to forge a community, Savarkar argued that name and place were what bound the Hindu community, not religion . . . The fundamental (negative) contribution of Hindutva was to install a new term for nationalist discourse, one that was both modern and secular, if open to a secular understanding of religious identity. In place of religion qua religion, he secularized a plethora of Hindu religious leaders. In so doing, he did not create a sterilely secular nationalism. He did quite the opposite. He enchanted a secular nationalism by placing a mythic community into a magical land."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Savarkar, Vikram Sampath'<br />Author: 'PhysicistAmar'  id: 'upj4o8'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/upj4o8/v_savarkar_thoughts_on_nationalism_is_more/</li>

But still, they felt the need for a lingua Franca a language that is adopted as a common language between speakers whose native languages are different.\n\nRabindranath tagore said: ‚ÄúOf course Hindi is the only possible national language for inter-provincial intercourse in India,‚Äù Because the most number of people understand or speak Hindi And Even though a lot of Indians speak English, I believe that the link language must be an Indian language. That will be as stupid as making the Queen of England the President of India because all States want the president from their state and we cannot reach an agreement\n\nBut sir Tagore ji also believed that," I think we cannot enforce it for a long time to come  \nSo, Hindi will have to remain optional in our national proceedings until a new generation‚Ä¶ fully alive to its importance, pave the way towards its general use by constant practice as a voluntary acceptance of a national obligation\n\nAnd I think that the generation talked by Tagore is our generation due to which is support Hindi as a national Language\n\nI see people saying that Hindi will overcame and the regional language will disappear\n\nNo this does not happens and this is not the aim. Take example of north India\n\nWe have language and dialects such as Punjabi, Haryanvi , Himachali, Bhojpuri, , Kashmiri, Nepali, Sindhi and Oriya disappeared?\n\nNo Not at all, instead this has made north India as a very co-operative and a collaborative helping eac part but whereas as South India where still each state is very prudent and very pushing towards promoting their languages and very polarised towards it .\n\nAnd lets say Hindi is destroying the regional languages then why the same threat is not felt for English, which has in actuality destroys so many regional languages\n\nPersonally, I think the people are scared of so ‚ÄúHindi Imposition‚Äù because of reason like  \nLack Of Understanding: Not understanding the benefits of having a link language  \nGenuine but misplaced fear that Hindi will replace your regional language\n\nAnd a franca lingua is important\n\nCities like Bombay, Delhi and Bangalore reaped the benefit of exchange and familiarity with the lingua franca of Hindi, and hence attracted labor and talent pool from all across India, thus boosting the growth of the city. Basically Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai have the same advantage over other cities because of its comfortability with Hindi that India has over other countries because of its comfortability with English  \nNational Education Policy (NEP) 2019 states that multilingualism has great cognitive beneÔ¨Åts to students, children will now be immersed in three languages: Hindi, English and local  \nschools in Hindi speaking areas should also offer and teach Indian languages from other parts of India.\n\n**I highly suggest people to read the selected works and letters exchanges between Major figures like Ravindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi this will help you understand this concept better**'<br />Author: 'Siddharthafk'  id: 'uorz0d'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uorz0d/why_i_want_hindi_to_be_the_national_language_of/</li>

Since my mom is a north indian, i get to attend a lot of north indian weddings and functions with my family. Just as everyone would know, north indian women dress in a different way than us. Apart from lehenga, salwar kameez the one attire i find alien for functions and events is the saree with a bikini blouse. Not all north indian women wear that, only few wear them being bold.\n\nSince i\'m born and raised in Chennai as my dad is from here, i more of a southie chennai paiyyan than a northie. Out of curiosity i once asked my mom about why do they wear bikini blouses for sarees as it\'s not traditional or a function friendly attire. The reply i got was "You don\'t tell a women what to wear for occasions" \U0001f972, I got this irrevelant reply as my mom wears it too based on the scale of the occasion.\n\nBut this trend is spreading wider here now, where i saw a couple of women wearing it in chennai for a sangeet which i attended with my family. Even though my mom wears it too, i can\'t ask her about it coz she replies like a feminist and she\'s a kind of fashionista as she was a flight attendant before.\n\nThere\'s around 3 bikini blouse in my home where the new one was purchased in "Diva\' store located here. These are sold for hefty prices along with the charges for stitching which results around 9k-10k, yet women buy them. For example, in my home she has the replica of "Desi girl" song saree &amp; blouse from Dostana movie which was purchased in Manish Malhotra store in Mumbai. They are indeed very expensive but could be worn rarely. Then why do they get that?. It looks like it\'s on the edge between two sides, one is fashionably attractive and other side is seductively bit slutty if it\'s worn in a different way. So it\'s bit risky to create a look by wearing that.\n\nI don\'t consider them as bad clothes. It\'s beautiful, just wondering why it\'s special than normal saree type and it attracts people more than other type of sarees. I have seen mom getting a lot of attention whenever she wears bikini blouses for party wear sarees and the desi girl saree for events and functions. I\'m not entirely leaning on the attire as she also gets attention during other times as she\'s fit, young and a former flight attendant who looks similar to Esha Gupta.\n\nI\'m not at all against this as i don\'t mind or judge people based on their dressing, just curious to know the reason for wearing it and the purpose it has.'<br />Author: 'hastalavistabruh7'  id: 'uoresy'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uoresy/why_do_women_wear_bikini_blouses_for_events_is/</li>

After India gained independence in 1947, the state was under Assam Rule.\n\nMeghalaya formation came about on 2 April 1970. Thereafter, Meghalaya was only formed on 21 January 1972 after Assam imposed the Assamese language which angered the tribal areas and the tribal areas demanded that their culture and language should not be ignored. Therefore, to fulfil the wishes of the tribal, Meghalaya was formed in 1972. The population of the state is around 3 million (2021). But based on the census, it is around 2.651 million.\n\nThe state subsequently held its first ever legislative assembly on 9 March 1972 with All Party Hill Leaders Conference winning the majority.\n\nThe state has a Christian majority (74.59%) with Hindus being the minority (11.25%).

      <li>Title::: 'Purveyors of SLIME (Self-Loathing Indian MEntality) Pt. 1'<br />Body: '\n\nIn his book "India: Vision 2020," our President Dr. Abdul Kalam mentions an episode during his visit to Israel. On that day, there was a suicide bombing and many people were killed. Yet the frontpage headlines in most Israeli newspapers concerned a new drip irrigation method. Pres. Kalam contrasts this optimistic view of society adopted by Israeli newspapers with the relentless negativism purveyed by our own English media. In recent months and years, I have begun to ask myself just why our English media is so negative. When I contrast the negativism of the English media with the much more balanced viewpoint adopted by Eenadu, the Telugu newspaper from which I get most of my news nowadays, I feel that there must be some inherent reasons for the negativism of our English speaking, self-styled "elite."\n\n...\n\nIf today we associate a convent-educated English accent with being "refined" and a down-home English accent like mine with being crude, we cannot blame anyone but ourselves. No one imposed that choice on us -- we made it ourselves. Part and parcel of being a Macaulay\'s child is that one has to be deeply and irremediably ashamed of everything Indian. And let us face it. While India was stuck in the grip of "Nehruvian socialism" with its all-pervasive bureaucracy and oppressive state control of all aspects of one\'s daily life, it was difficult for even patriotic Indians to counter the doom and gloom dished out by these Macaulay\'s children. But even after India has made a decisive (and I hope, irreversible) turn away from its Nehruvian past, our Macaulay\'s children refuse to see anything good about India. Given that they define themselves by their relentless negativism and low self-esteem, one should not expect them to change, if left to their own devices. \n\n\nWhy is it so easy to slander India and get away with it? My suggested answer is: Because one does not pay any price for doing so. \n\nLet me elaborate. I mean that the Arundhati Roys, the Dilip D\'Souzas and the Praful Bidwais of this world do not pay any penalty at all for purveying their own peculiar brand of venom. No one will pass a "fatwa" against them, ordering that they be killed, as happened in the case of Salman Rushdie. Indeed, if one tries counter such negativists through any sort of rational argument, they deflect the argument to how "brave" they are to bash India while still living in India. In short, India is a very soft target, and Hindus are a soft target. People like Arundhati Roy, Dilip D\'Souza etc. are are purveyors of what I call the Self-Loathing Indian MEntality, or SLIME for short. They are modern-day Macaulay\'s children, full of self-loathing, and the only way in which they can bear their own miserable existence is to heap scorn on everyone around them. There is no point saying that what they say is "true". In a huge and heterogenous society like India, one instance of almost every kind of deviant behaviour can be found, especially if one goes looking for it. The issue at hand is one of perspective. When Catherine Mayo brought out her notorious book "Mother India," Mahatma Gandhi called it a "drain inspector\'s report." (I prefer the expression "gutter inspector\'s report," but then who am I to argue with the father of the nation?) The purveyors of SLIME are modern day Catherine Mayos and modern day gutter inspectors. Their day to day living depends on purveying trash. Look at Arundhati Roy for example, a woman who seems to be suffering from the writer\'s block of all time. How does she keep herself in the limelight in the absence of any creative output for years? By maligning her country of course. Look at Praful Bidwai, a communist whose ideology has been discredited everywhere, even in its cradle. How does he keep pretending to be an authority on everything, even when Indian leftists have achieved nothing of note besides keeping India poor for decades? By maligning his country of course. The list goes on. \n\nWhy is it important to counter SLIME? As stated above, in his book "India: Vision 2020," our President Dr. Abdul Kalam contrasts the negative attitude of the Indian (English) media with the optimistic attitude of the Israeli media. Since unfortunately much of the Indian the middle class reads and is influenced mostly by English media, SLIME causes us to lower our expectations of ourselves, and to believe the worst about our society and country. SLIME leads us to discount and deprecate our own achievements, often realized against great odds, while lauding the often trivial achievements of other societies, and of our compatriots who have emigrated.\n\nWe make a very basic mistake if we delude ourselves into thinking that the purveyors of SLIME are well-meaning but somewhat misguided critics of India, and an even more serious mistake if we believe that they are well-wishers of India, however much we might disagree with their conclusions. We must face the truth, namely: These people are enemies of modern India. If Pakistan is the enemy without, they are the enemy within. \n\nn short, we cannot afford to treat the purveyors of SLIME as people just like us, who merely happen to hold different views. They are out to undermine, even destroy Indian society. And we cannot eradicate SLIME unless we take radical measures. Rational debate won\'t do the job, for reasons mentioned above. Moreover, this is not a "dharma yuddha" -- The purveyors of SLIME are fighting a dirty war in which they don\'t follow any rules, so we need not either. In short, we have to fight fire with fire. It behooves us, the patriotic Indians, to find a way to make the purveyors of SLIME run for cover -- and all\'s is fair in (love and) war! \n\nFrom a blog written by an Indian scientist almost 20 years ago.'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'uoq4js'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uoq4js/purveyors_of_slime_selfloathing_indian_mentality/</li>

      <li>Title::: "An Important Discussion: Let's Create New Bharat! (Let's Do Something Really Good For The Country!)"<br />Body: 'One thing that Kashmir Files movie did is it exemplified how we the people and especially Hindus (or any people who love and care about this great land) can reclaim our power back through the means of great fact sharing movies about what is actually happening or happened in this country. Vivek Agnihotri is making many other Files films which will put the power back more where it belongs - in we the people. And because Bollywood formula films are no longer attractive for millions, many other producers are shifting more to Vivek\'s formula, just to survive. This is very good!\n\nThere is also a great renaissance happening where Hindus are finally waking up and reclaiming our power back. I have created a sub titled "Let\'s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0" ([r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)). The purpose of this sub is to Unite and Empower and foster nationalistic and Spiritual movements in this country. I have been Spiritual since a young age and have lived abroad, mostly in the US, most of my life. Currently I am living in Delhi. The reason I started this sub is because I was very moved about the story of Wasim Rizvi who did ghar wapsi to Hinduism and became Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi, and is currently in jail due to corrupt politicians.\n\nA few days ago I had written a post on IndiaSpeaks about a film that Mr. Tyagi made when he was still Wasim Rizvi. The movie is called "Helpless" and is about Pakistani Muslims. It\'s an excellent movie and in many ways it\'s as powerful and hard-hitting as Kashmir Files. It\'s a Must See! In my sub we are brainstorming about how to take this film viral, just like Kashmir Files went viral, because it was promoted only through word of mouth. Kashmir Files had no money when they started. The Helpless film is free to watch online here: [https://youtu.be/DRf7fqhmbT4?t=344](https://youtu.be/DRf7fqhmbT4?t=344)\n\nI also recommend that you read a post that I wrote on IndiaSpeaks a couple weeks ago about Mr Tyagi. It\'s below (please read the full post - it will only take 5 mins or so to read). And if you really Love Bharat and want to interact with like minded people, I highly recommend that you join our sub after reading the post below. Let\'s do something really good for the country! (We are brainstorming many other projects, not just one!)\n\n\\------------\n\n**Do you Love Bharat, India and Sanatani, Please read this post fully! This is a Must Read post for all Hindus and others who really Love and care about Bharat and our future! Please Help Make this post go viral!**\n\nNamaskaram,\n\nMost people here may know who Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi is. He had done ghar wapsi to Hinduism - he was previously the chairman of Shia Waqf Board and held a very high post in Shia muslim religion. His muslim name was Wasim Rizvi. He is currently in jail. Because he has done more for Hinduism, Hindutva and Bharat in current times than I think anyone else I know of, to awaken us all and to warn us about what he feels is coming in Bharat. And a very powerful lobby of Muslim politicians, the D gang and foreign money want him locked up forever or dead. His chances of getting out of jail anytime soon are very slim due to this lobby and politicians.\n\nAfter seeing many videos about him on Youtube, I was feeling very sad because no one was doing anything for him. I wanted to do something. I was thinking of a way to spread his story, to educate many people about who this amazing person is and what he was trying to do for us. I was thinking, is there a way for this to go viral so it can reach ??? maybe Vivek Agnihotri, Kangana Renaut, maybe wealthy Indians in other countries who care and want to do something.\n\nI sincerely believe that a renaissance or Spiritual awakening is happening and is very essential in Bharat. People need to wake up now and get involved (which is happening due to Kashmir Files movie, etc). We have got to wake up the Hindu masses and the national and spiritual consciousness. Because if we don\'t, I sincerely believe that we are heading towards civil war in this country. And a lot of hardship, misery or suffering for tons of people.\n\nI also wanted to share a few words about myself. My name is Bobby Luthra. I love Bharat and I thank God that I was born in a Hindu family. I am so, so grateful. I have been Spiritually minded since a young age (although not religious). I have lived outside of India since a young age, mostly in the US. Now I am in Delhi, taking care of my 92yo mother. I don\'t know and have never been involved with Jitendra Tyagi or the Hindu saints (Swami Yeti Narasimhanand, and Swami Amritanand) who appear with him in his videos. I have only been watching the videos online.\n\nI also know that a major shift in consciousness is happening in humanity in current times. All these accelerated global events that are happening since 2019 (pandemic, Ukraine war, being on brink of ww3, etc). Then all these events happening in Bharat such as Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots, the attacks on Hindu processions in 7 states and I have heard in over 100+ locations. And so so much more. What the heck is happening? I believe this is all part of the Spiritual awakening of humanity. The awakening is happening and so needed! I will talk more about this further down below.\n\nI am providing some must see videos about Jitendar Tyagi below. I believe Mr Tyagi has done everything out of Love, Truth and morality, to awaken all of us to the truth about Islam and Mohammed. He wrote a book about Mohammed when he was still Wasim Rizvi, by pulling together all the facts about Mohammed from authentic muslim sources such as Hadith, etc. Then he called all the Muslim religious leaders to debate with him about what was written in the book. Not one person came forward. He has never done anything out of malicious intent, only for the sake of truth. And for true caring and compassion and brotherly Love for everyone in Bharat.\n\nI also think that most Hindus and Sanatanis are asleep. We have little power left. No one in Bharat knows about Mr. Tyagi or cares to do anything about it. The Uttarakhand AAIMS doctors have said he is suffering from heart disease and needs to be out of jail because they can‚Äôt operate on him in jail. There is very good chance he may die in jail. He is still very young, I think in his late 40s. If no Sanatani comes forward and helps him, I think this will be a great injustice. And great shame on us! The 2 Swamis who are trying to help him have almost run out of money. We need people to step forward and act - and fight for justice!\n\nI am not involved with Mr Tyagi or any of these people. But I am a Spiritual person and I felt I had to do something. That is why I started working on a plan and writing this post. I did this only out of Love for Hinduism and Bharat. I received a Spiritual plan which I believe is magnificent. It will change tons of people‚Äôs consciousness in a massive way in Bharat. It‚Äôs an enormous vision! That‚Äôs why I urge everyone to read what I have written here totally. Especially if you are open to Spirituality or are being called to do something. Do not skip over anything I have written here. I believe this can reach a lot of people, and cause massive awakening in people. If you like this, please help this post and message to go viral! I am creating a blog, FB groups, Reddit groups, Twitter, Youtube channel, Instagram, etc, etc. I sincerely believe we all need to do something, otherwise Bharat is in trouble. I went within and asked for a solution, and this is what I received from Spirit!\n\nIf you are not too familiar with Jitendra Narayan Tyagi\'s story, then please watch these videos below.

All the great discoveries of mankind came from Bharat! Without the number 0, there could be no science, technology, engineering. Do you know that? Now I believe this country may go down the drain or be engulfed in civil war. That is why I am writing this and will be involved with this mission and to fully create this vision. To awaken as many people as possible! Please follow what I am doing and like my post!\n\nPlease join my Subreddit - Let‚Äôs Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0 (link is at bottom of this post)! I see New Bharat or Bharat 2.0 as Full of Love and Spirit! Our Power will come from that!\n\nI believe All the problems in our world and in Bharat stem from the fact that there is not enough Love in our country and world. Humanity has forgotten how to live in Love! Look at everything that is happening - the Pandemic, all the war and destruction. It has one root cause - not enough Love. Not enough Love. Can you see that? In my Subreddit on Bharat 2.0 we will impart simple ways all of us can restore Love or Divine Love back into our lives! I urge everyone to spend some part of every day focusing on something, anything you really Love! Something you can work on selflessly from your Heart because you truly Love it! Soon your life will start flowing with Divine Love! And our communities and nation also will start flowing with Divine Love like a massive river!\n\n(This is exactly how I started working on this mission to help free Jitendar Tyagi and wake up the masses! I am also a very busy guy. I initially hesitated. I felt what can I do? How can I do anything? But I felt I need to do this out of my pure selfless Love for Bharat and for Hinduism. This is like the Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Arjun and Krishna happened inside me. And I eventually surrendered to Krishna‚Äôs play or Divine Will.)\n\nWe are born out of Love and we are returning back to Love! Love is who we are! Love is our true nature! God is Love! Have you heard people say my religion is Love! This is what Bharat and our world is returning back to more and more now. All the chaos you are seeing currently will soon be gone! But we‚Äôve got to do our part. And fill our lives and mind and heart with Love! We have to do this daily! Work on something daily selflessly. Please, please do that! (If you can‚Äôt think of anything to work on selflessly from your heart, just spread this post! This can spread the Love and Light!)\n\nHow many Hindus have the courage to stand up for the Truth, Justice and the Love in their Heart? Jitendar Tyagi stood up for them. That is why he made his movie and did what he did. Why can\'t we create a group of people who want to follow in his footsteps?\n\nI urge you now to do 3 things (please do 1 and if you have more time do 2 and 3 also)\n\n**1** Spread my post to others - Everyone, please do this! This is the only part that I want everyone to do. Because we need everyone to start waking up now and start understanding what\'s really going on in Bharat! #2 and #3 are optional. Do them if you have the time.\n\nDon\'t worry if you don\'t understand anything right now. Just read it a few times and you will start getting it very soon.\n\n**2** If you have time, start going through more of what I am writing in my Subreddit ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0‚Äù Just start reading more and seeing the videos. Then you can learn more. Here is my Sub: [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\n**3** Start learning more of the methods I am teaching. They are very simple and powerful Spiritual methods. Like the 4 min meditation. This meditation is only 4 mins and it has changed my life! And I know this will change your life also if you learn it! (This helps in all areas of life - relationships, work, job, money, health.)\n\nPlease help the Swamiji‚Äôs to help Jitendra Tyagi! Just see the videos in this post above about how they can be reached! Please help them in any ways you can!\n\nI will soon be having zoom calls weekly also! And start talking about this type of stuff.I am feeling that currently we in Bharat have 2 choices. Either we move forwards towards total Love. Or total chaos and destruction. It‚Äôs our choice! My mission is to help people understand how we can move forwards towards total Love! (And joy and happiness and all good things!)\n\nIn my Subreddit, we also focus on spreading Sadhguru‚Äôs SaveSoil movement! That is also very essential! So please spread this post so more and more people join our Subreddit!\n\nThank you!\n\nPranam!\n\nBobby\n\n[r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)'<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'uofjtv'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uofjtv/an_important_discussion_lets_create_new_bharat/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Long Post] Common PsyOp tactis used by the Indian LW'<br />Body: 'Jai Hind!\n\nI have briefly described the simplest tactics used during the anti CAA and anti farm-laws protest, by the LW of India. At the end of it, I have outlined the general process of such tactics during any protest. \n\n***\\*\\* TLDR towards the end \\*\\****\n\nDecember 2019 Anti CAA protests - all of the CAA protests were trying to convince that the center is not allowing "a certain religious minority" to take part in the indian citizenship. This, of course, was completely false. Section 3A of the amendment clearly stated that religious minorities out of pakistan and bangladesh, living in India as immigrants, will have their naturalization period reduced from 11 years to 5 years. No mention of preventing muslims from undergoing the citizenship process through naturalization at all. Even then, the protesters and the media houses pushed for the narrative of an anti-muslim CAA. This is blatant disinformation and disregard of the source of the amendment, specifically the section 3A. Also, the notion of "muslims being prevented to be citizens of India" led to an emotional and ethical victory of that narrative.\n\n2020 Anti Farm-laws protests - was there a mention of removing the minimum support price (MSP) at all? Even then those idiots protested against it. Shitheads like greta thunberg, not having even a basic knowledge about their functions, came out in support of the farmers and the shameful anti-national hoisting of khalistani flag on the red-fort. That idiotic greta even accidentally leaked a "toolkit", which included a list of people to tag in a tweet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[TLDR\\]** Outlining various steps of PsyOps in protests from the above examples: \n\n* **Identification of an Oppressor-Victim pair** for any given narrative, and complete **reduction of that narrative in terms of an oppressor and a victim**.\n* **Creating another narrative** out of the original one, by partially (Gray Propaganda) or completely disregarding (Black Propaganda) the source of the original narrative, in such a way that the **resultant narrative always depicts the "opperssor" tormenting the "victim"**. \n* **Use mass media houses** (the wire, ndtv, scroll and the likes) **to convey the created narrative** to a larger audience. Obviously, the majority of **audience sympathises with the "victim"**, winning the "ethical" side of the arguement.\n* **Gather support from known personalities**, extra-territorial organizations (like UN, human rights NGOs, etc.) and other agents of influence, which **demoralizes the audience in support of the original narrative** (remember, from the perspective of the fake narrative, **supporting the original narrative is supporting and validating the "opperessor"**).\n\nAnd it isn\'t just during the protests that we see the propaganda machine spew up - what congress did (what BJP is unwilling to do, and what AAP might certainly do in punjab) by **writing false history text books for schools is also a serious yet subtle disinformation tactic** (or a "cold propaganda"). There is an **amplification of the propaganda** when the target audience is young (which is further amplified by students\' memorization of the content for the sake of exams). What the punjab CM announced a few days ago - state sponsored training programs for teachers - is clearly a step in that direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts high time we used such tactics to make sure the original narrative gets through.'<br />Author: 'Cyberpsychic'  id: 'uo21pw'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uo21pw/long_post_common_psyop_tactis_used_by_the_indian/</li>

Not surprisingly, the results show the largest gains for previously isolated Russia, other former European communist economies, and China, and also for India, some African countries, and Brazil. Moreover, as a result of these shifts, **by 2017** the** global connectedness of China was as high as that of Japan; Russia‚Äôs rivaled that of Sweden; and India could be compared with Singapore**. If any of these pairings strikes you as questionable, just think of China‚Äôs place as the largest manufacturer of consumer goods, of Russia‚Äôs enormous exports of energy and minerals, and of the contingent of Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley.\n\nFrom: How the World Really Works: The Science Behind How We Got Here and Where We're Going *by Vaclav Smil*"<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'unqlxk'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/unqlxk/globalization_and_india/</li>

I will not be talking about anything like that, so if you are here looking for that, please scroll forward and read something else.\n\nNow Let\'s start.  \nThe goal here is to create an India that is completely secure(or as secure as it can get) from invasion and has the ability to project power outwards and play on the front foot without fear of security risks.  \nFirst let me talk about this concept known as Natural boundaries of a nation. A Nation\'s natural boundaries are clear geographic boundaries that demarcate a nation. Things like Mountains, the ocean, rivers, marshes etc. I\'ll be explaining this concept by example of a few countries and then talk about India\n\nIf my memory serves me right, the concept of Natural boundaries and expansion of a nation\'s borders to more secure National boundaries was devised in France under [Louis IV "the sun king"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV) and his chief advisor Cardinal Richelieu. Since it was the French who invented the concept let\'s talk about them first.\n\n**FRANCE**  \nIf we look at a [geographical map of France](https://about-france.com/photos/maps/france-physical-map.jpg), it is almost perfect in terms of defensible natural boundaries with the Alps mountains in the south east, the Pyrenees mountains in the south west, and the ocean on the west and north. The soft spot in France\'s armor was the flat north eastern regions which are part of the [great north European plain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/European_plain.png) which also happens to plague Russia which I\'ll come to after France. It has been quite easy to lead attacks against france from here, also happens to be the place from where the Frankish tribes which established France invaded these lands.  \nLouis Deemed that the [Rhine River](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b4/73/de/b473dec2c32a6d265e90ed37fbe92471.png) should\'ve been France\'s natural boundary and everything west of the Rhine river should\'ve been French hence [this being France\'s Natural boundary](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/83/eb/b6/83ebb695090674001d54013120e85a46--map-of-france-french-revolution.jpg). And France gradually pushed to secure these borders from [this](https://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/france/france1400s.gif) to finally [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Flag-map_of_the_First_French_Empire.svg/727px-Flag-map_of_the_First_French_Empire.svg.png) under Napoleon. But Napoleon lost his conquests by destroying his Armies in Russia. After that France could never secure it\'s natural boundaries and it has been invaded from that exact path thrice since Napoleon and been defeated all three times.\n\n**RUSSIA**  \nNow let\'s talk about Russia which dashed France\'s dreams. Russia suffers from the fact that it has so much extremely flat land to defend which is extremely difficult with it\'s low population and the fact that flat land is extremely easy to attack. Russia came to the conclusion that it needed to conquer all of this flat land set their natural boundaries at areas with mountains where it\'s easier to defend, hence why Russia is so big. They conquered all of Central Asia until they reached the Hindukush mountains in Afghanistan and all of the pontic Steppe until they reached the caucuses mountains. That leaves one more chokepoint, [the great northern european plains](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/European_plain.png) upon which the Russian Slavic heartland is situated. This is also the path Napoleon, Hitler, the Swedes and the Poles took to invade Russia. But if we look at these plains, we see that the plain narrows as we go west thus less flat land to defend and Russia knows this and since the times of Tsar Peter Romanov, a concerted push into taking more land of this region. The Russian empire pushed as far as Poland in trying to achieve this goal with [Empire at it\'s height under Tsar Alexander 1](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/640x539/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/johnmauldin/files/2016/02/Mauldin-Russian-Empire-revised-1.jpg?width=960) but the work finally got complete under [Stalin\'s USSR after ww2](https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/styles/wv_small/public/russia-warsaw-pact-text-update-032117.png?itok=7RcGw3Ph). But after it\'s breakup, Russia lost centuries of conquest and that\'s why Putin openly despises Yeltsin and Gorbachev and calls them Traitors to Mother Russia.\n\n**CHINA**  \nLet\'s come close to home to China, our friendly neighbour.  \nIn China\'s case, it\'s choke point is also it\'s greatest treasure, the silk road has been a road for trade and commerce but also a path for Turkic tribes to come and conquer China. Hence China has always tried to control the Silk road and the region of Xinjiang which is the gateway from where invaders enter China. China has always tried to conquer these regions and everything west of the Chinese heartland to create buffers.  \nIn fact a good way to spot if a Chinese Dynasty was strong or not is to see if it held these region or not. The strongest Chinese dynasties were [the Han](https://www.china-mike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Han-dynasty-Map.jpg), [the Tang](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/dc844dc8-1996-446c-b112-68b82a28e840/d83jt4y-f94d8fc4-620d-4466-a6c9-9bc9fa01cf43.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2RjODQ0ZGM4LTE5OTYtNDQ2Yy1iMTEyLTY4YjgyYTI4ZTg0MFwvZDgzanQ0eS1mOTRkOGZjNC02MjBkLTQ0NjYtYTZjOS05YmM5ZmEwMWNmNDMucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.UqYK7DQhvSAdV_UhguRsenkp34PMYvdZ-DtloOdSJwk), [the Yuan](https://images.chinahighlights.com/allpicture/2021/11/7bf92fd53c874d3a80abf820_cut_798x471_349.jpg) and [the Qing](https://cdn.britannica.com/38/64938-050-FA3FE2DD/China-Qing-dynasty.jpg).  \nAnd all the weak dynasties that got conquered were [the Sui](https://learnodo-newtonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Map-of-reunified-China-under-Sui-dynasty.jpg), [the Sung](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRX7VokQYDsweBeUUB1vpz0ziagwtYb8RYJ5g&amp;usqp=CAU) and [the Ming](https://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/image/mapofmingdynasty.jpg) dynasties which got conquered by barbarians(the chinese called them that I don\'t).\n\n*I think I have done a decent job explaining the concept natural boundaries, expansion of said boundaries and how countries set their goals as to what their natural boundaries should be.*\n\n*Now let\'s talk about our lovely country*\n\n***INDIA***  \nNow before I start, I\'ll recommend all the pacifists to stop reading, because redrawing borders is not bloodless and quite morally gray.\n\nlet\'s begin.  \nFirstly, [here\'s a geographical map of the Indian subcontinent](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2F7F99E/physical-map-of-south-asia-with-high-resolution-details-flattened-satellite-view-of-planet-earth-and-its-geography-elements-furnished-by-nasa-2F7F99E.jpg), take a good look at it.\n\n**The Southern region**  \nSo let us first look at the parts of the country that are good natural boundaries, which is southern India. Firstly, we\'ve got the sea. Even if enemies invade and land on the beaches, we have the eastern and western Ghats and then even inwards the Deccan Plateau. As long as Indians have the will to fight, the invader may keep fighting for the next 5 centuries but it won\'t be able to conquer India from the south, which is great. But we should strive to control as many Indian ocean Islands as we can so war never comes to Indian soil in the first place. Fantastic, so let\'s get to the more messy bits.\n\n**North East**  \nthe North east was invaded by the Japanese and we were able to hold the Japanese at bay only in the marshes of Bengal, such an arrangement is too costly on Indian lives. In this case we need to create a long buffer so that any invasion from this side can be stalled in the thick jungles of south east Asia in a war of Attrition that never actually reaches Indian homeland.\n\n**The Himalayas**  \nI have noticed a few times that a lot of Indians like to spout nonsense like the Himalayas are our defensive wall. However if more than 90% of your wall is occupied by your enemy, is it really your wall? Or is it his? That is why I think that for India to secure it\'s Himalayan border, it needs to take Tibet in it\'s control. It could be an Indian puppet but ideally a proper state of the Republic of India. This gives us another advantage. If we control Tibet, we can always threaten China with Invasion and our threats would be way more worthwhile than the Chinese. The Himalayas are at it\'s Highest in India and Nepal, gradually decreasing in height as we go inwards into China. Hence even with having only a small portion of the Himalayas our defenses are not too bad. But for China, it would be a catastrophe. A constant threat of Indians descending to attack thus making them more submissive to our whims.\n\nWe could probably set up a puppet state in the taklamakan deserts well, an ethno state of Uyghur turks. Would be good for PR to be the liberators of the long oppressed Uyghurs.\n\n**The Hindukush**\n\nIf you have read your Indian history, you know that most invasions of India have happened from here. These mountain ranges are relatively easy to cross and enter India through the khyber pass for example. In this case case we need to conquer and control the entirety on the Hindukush mountain range and gain a stable base in the [Iranian Plateau](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmadreza-Malekpour-Alamdari/publication/317053582/figure/fig15/AS:642924345835522@1530296517112/Simplified-geological-map-of-the-Iranian-plateau-and-its-structural-domains.png) as well as as the [Central asian Steppe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Central-Asia-map.PNG).  \nThe expansion into Central asia also has another benefit. It would propel us directly in the middle of Asia. By Controlling the Indian ocean as well as Central Asia, we would become the middle men between Europe and the far east which has it\'s own benefits as well as we would be directly threatening Russia which has other benefits of it\'s own. Overall it\'s really amazing powerplay.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow a thing to keep in mind is I am not saying India should become a Nazi Germany style country, go on a 5 year long Grand Crusade to conquer everything, cause then what happened to Nazi germany will happen to us. The world will gang up on us and crush us.\n\nThis is gonna be a multi century nation building project, fighting small wars, taking small bites of territories, making and breaking treaties. Many of you will say this is delusional and there is no chance of this happening. I accept that it\'s an extremely tall task and making it happen in 2 centuries is difficult, agreed. But it\'s not impossible. Other countries have also done it, I already gave three examples. Another good example is the German Empire. The german Empire was once the little Margraviate of Brandenburg Prussia, and paid homage to both the Holy roman Emperor and the King of Poland. But Prussia wanted more than this and through study conquests, better organisation of government, innovative tactics and systems this little Margraviate which wasn\'t even a kingdom initially and had to earn that right, became the strongest Empire in all of Europe by the time ww1 came around. Unlike Prussia, India does not lack resources or man power, what India lacks is political will which Prussia had in spades.\n\nBut what I am getting at is India needs to reform, fine tune and clean it\'s systems of government, make the state effective, bold and fast in taking action before we can take this project seriously. Another thing India needs is innovation, copy pasting Prussian, Russian or French military doctrine to India is no solution cause their circumstances were not the same as India. India needs to work on it\'s very own military doctrine and do RnD. Just mindlessly buying French or Russian equipement isn\'t good enough. The purchase of equipment should be done according to military doctrine. Just purchasing cool stuff won\'t win you wars. But with political will, intelligent leadership and good luck we can pull this off.\n\n***TL;DR:*** **India should strive to secure it\'s natural boundaries to keep it safe and allow it to project power outwards.**\n\n***NOTE:*** chances are what I have written is stupid, factually incorrect, logically incorrect or false. I am not a defense analyst. I am just a cocky 17 year old who likes to read a lot and listen to podcasts and is overconfident(perhaps because of my youth) to think that I can draw up plans for the whole damn world.

While he is correct that a common person would not be able to understand, so this is a humble attempt from my side explaining the two timestamps on this video also cautioning how one should be extremely careful while listening to pseudoscientific people like Dr Vedam (who happens to be an engineer and not credentialed in the relevant field).\n\nLets go to 44:00\n\nThe paper that Vedam is referring to is attached below: (Damgaard 2018) [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7711)\n\nThis is the paper by Narasimhan that he quotes before this paper that supposedly gave a "diametrically opposite" result.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822619/) (Narasimhan 2019)\n\nFor simplicity\'s sake, I will be referring to them as Damgaard and Narasimhan respectively.\n\nTwo points that I need to make about the Damgaard paper.\n\n1. The Damgaard paper erroneously stated that steppe influx in South Asia was little to none. Yet in the same paper they also posit that these steppe people forced a language change in India. Keep in mind, the language change is what is vehemently argued against by these pseudoscientific nationalists. Let me paste a relevant excerpt.*Our findings reveal that the early spread of Yamnaya Bronze Age pastoralists had limited genetic impact in Anatolia as well as Central and South Asia. As such, the Asian story of Early Bronze Age expansions differs from that of Europe. Intriguingly, we find that direct descendants of Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers of Central Asia, now extinct as a separate lineage, survived well into the Bronze Age. These groups likely engaged in early horse domestication as a preyroute transition from hunting to herding, as otherwise seen for reindeer. Our findings further suggest that West Eurasian ancestry entered South Asia before and after, rather than during, the initial expansion of western steppe pastoralists, with the later event consistent with a Late Bronze Age entry of IE languages into South Asia. Finally, the lack of steppe ancestry in samples from Anatolia indicates that the spread of the earliest branch of IE languages into that region was not associated with a major population migration from the steppe.*\n\nThis paper is clearly saying that even though genetically Yamnaya had limited impact in India, they did force a language change, which introduced a language change in India, but why did this paper make such an error? The answer is simple, Yamnaya ancestry, which is considered to be the OG steppe ancestry is low in Indians, because Indians dont exactly get ancestry from Yamnaya, indians get ancestry from a daughter culture which is known as Sintashta Culture. Sintashta has 60-65 percent ancestry from yamnaya only. When you use this on qpAdm, direct yamnaya will fail most of the time because its a bit too archaic for Indians. Sintashta passes, and it passes with flying colors. 2. The paper used a small number of samples, and a lot of samples were not even relevant for ascertaining steppe ancestry in Indians. Case in Point: What i referred to point #1. Sintashta samples were not chosen as reference ancestry for steppe in Indians. There were only 74 samples from the steppe, the data hence was not so robust. The way qpAdm, the tool for calculating ancestry weightage works is that you need to have a very robust set of reference population groups, which was unfortunately not the case here.To simplify it even more, we obviously all come from Africa, but its impossible to directly link all of us to africa without considering the population that were around in the transtion phase from africa to eurasia.\n\nSo in short: this paper is not supporting Raj Vedam\'s conclusions, its infact opposing it. The lack of yamnaya ancestry is there because of irrelevant sample chosen.\n\nThis mistake was corrected by Narasimhan 2019 who then published 523 ancient genomes, and was successfully able to link indians with Sintashta conclusively. The data is available freely for anyone to verify the claims, if they have the time, every tool is available open source.\n\nNow lets go to 48:00 and see whats going on there.\n\nHe is chalking the non usage of Lucotte G (or Gerarld Lucotte) and his paper not being used because "there is snobbery in research". Lets investigate this claim, shall we? find the "paper" attached here:\n\n[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reduced-variability-in-Y-chromosome-specific-for-Lucotte-G%C3%A9rard/d2197c64fc2c69764e8de7034c6374f7a8bd6264](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reduced-variability-in-Y-chromosome-specific-for-Lucotte-G%C3%A9rard/d2197c64fc2c69764e8de7034c6374f7a8bd6264)\n\nLets ignore the paper for a minute, we will come back to it later.

This is what users and fellow academicians have to say about Longdom Publishing\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is\\_Longdom\\_Publishing\\_a\\_predatory\\_publisher](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_Longdom_Publishing_a_predatory_publisher)\n\nSome choice feedback:\n\n*Dear Mohammad, I looked for it on the web, and everything seems to point it out as a predator journal.

In December 1996 , he was notably the speaker of the Club de l\'horloge at a symposium entitled "On the existence of human races and their hereditary basis" 11 , 12 .*\n\n*In 1997 , during an interview with National-Hebdo, he considers that the denial of race certainly arises from a ‚Äúlaudable, but somewhat naive motive. We think that if we say that races do not exist, racism will disappear‚Äù, in particular so-called ‚Äúzoological‚Äù racism, ‚Äúthat is to say that based on the biological reality of race. It is obvious that if races do not exist, there can be no biological basis for racism‚Äù However, ‚ÄúBiology as a whole is against this notion that races do not exist. On the contrary, and many works go in this direction, we study ethnic particularisms (we have the right to speak of ethnicity, not of race). In all the works, taken up by all the major medical periodicals, we demonstrate, for example, a different susceptibility to most diseases, including infectious diseases, depending on the race. " " For example,cystic fibrosis is a very common disease that black people do not have, or very little. Conversely, blacks suffer from sickle cell anemia which is due to a mutation of hemoglobin , Ashkenazi Jews have Tay-Sachs disease , a terrible neurological impairment of children. For Mediterranean populations, it is thalassemia , another hemoglobin mutation. We can therefore say that the races are unequal in the sense that each of them has a genetic burdenparticular that does not exist in others. G√©rard Lucotte also noted that ‚ÄúEach breed is the culmination of a long biological history from which results genetic adaptation to climate and living conditions. Each race is of course adapted to the biotope in which it lives. There is indeed only one human species, and not several as some believed at one time. Within this single species, there is diversification, that is, different adaptations that are the great races. And in my opinion, it is very important that this diversity ‚Äì a real delicate treasure of differential adaptation ‚Äì is maintained‚Äù 13 .*\n\n*Beyond these positions, it is the scientific value of G√©rard Lucotte\'s research that is called into question*\n\nThis is an excerpt from the French wiki page of Lucotte, translated in english.\n\n[https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lepoint.fr%2Fsociete%2Fjesus-la-bataille-de-l-adn-10-11-2005-23736\\_23.php#federation=archive.wikiwix.com](https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lepoint.fr%2Fsociete%2Fjesus-la-bataille-de-l-adn-10-11-2005-23736_23.php#federation=archive.wikiwix.com)\n\nFor further reading.\n\nSo in summary, a paper that is :\n\na. Old\n\nb. Published in a shitty journal;\n\nc. Published by a weird man\n\nis not taken into consideration by a top university, and its somehow snobbery? The results would be far more robust had they been peer reviewd by Nature/Science/Cell. But they have not.\n\nFurther studies have proven TMCRA of z93 to be 4600 ybp. If its 18000 ybp, why dont we have any ancient DNA anywhere close to that range? 2836‚Äì2573 BCE is the date given for oldest available r1a-z93 that we know of which is NAU001 from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817100/) paper. So again, whats the basis of it? Ancient DNA makes it obsolete. TMCRA calculations do not seem accurate at all when you take aDNA and modern methods into account.\n\nThis is just a criticism of 2 points. I can write a book about why Vedam\'s video is exceptionally poor.

      <li>Title::: 'A Request to the mods and the users of this subreddit'<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe recent news that 800 Hindu migrants from Pakistan have gone back due to their delay in their citizenship process got me thinking that we should use the large platform of this subreddit to crowdfund organizations dealing with migrants or help them directly with their citizenship process. I understand that the online government portal for citizenship doesn't accept expired passports from Pakistan. Since most of these people are poor, it's hard for them to pay around 10,000 INR per individual to the Pakistan High Commission to get it renewed. The majority of these people are escaping the repeated forced conversion attempts and daily torture to come here, and they are now returning to the same place they are running from. We, as a community, should try to help, as I know there are a lot of like-minded individuals here who are also thinking of helping but don't know how. So, it's time for this community to unite and do something good."<br />Author: 'kazstar101'  id: 'un2b58'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/un2b58/a_request_to_the_mods_and_the_users_of_this/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Important Discussion on "Let\'s Create New Bharat". And yesterday\'s Discussion on "If you Love Kashmir Files movie, you will LOVE Helpless movie also". What is currently going on? ALL who Love Bharat and Hinduism and care about our Future MUST READ This!'<br />Body: '**What Is Let\'s Create New Bharat?**  \n\n\nNamaskaram,\n\nYesterday we had an important discussion on Kashmir Files movie and Helpless movie (which all people must see - Many Love Helpless as much as Kashmir Files!)  And I talked about Mr. Wasim Rizvi who created the Helpless movie.  Mr Rizvi did ghar wapsi to Hinduism and became Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi.    Anyone who has not read yesterday\'s discussion must read it.  (It got almost 250 upvotes on IndiaSpeaks)\n\nI think it may be better for you to read yesterday\'s discussion first, if you have not read it yet.  It is here (then please come back here - it\'s very important!):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/um5lw4/if\\_you\\_loved\\_kashmir\\_files\\_movie\\_you\\_will\\_love/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/um5lw4/if_you_loved_kashmir_files_movie_you_will_love/)\n\n(I urge everyone to see the Helpless movie as soon as you can!  It\'s an excellent movie about Pakistani Hindus!  Please see yesterday\'s discussion for the link to the movie.)\n\nNow I want to get as many people as possible interested in this idea "Let\'s Create New Bharat".\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say I don\'t really care if you join my group, start reading my sub (r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0)  or join the Swamijis who are trying to help Mr. Tyagi.  But it\'s very important to get involved!  And do something daily (work even 10 mins a day doing something selflessly from your Heart).  Don\'t just focus on making money.  \nMoney is very important to give our family a good life.  But nation is also very important.  I am also a very busy guy.  But I work on this project daily, selflessly, without fail.  I make no money  from this.  But my Heart is here!\n\nI believe that Hindus have a false sense of security.  They falsely believe that they are 80% of the country and so nothing can happen to them.  Mr. Tyagi says that our adversaries are trained since childhood to hate us and focus on our destruction.  I believe him.  He has been part of the other side.  Now he\'s on our side.  (And we are not 80% anymore.  That is a lie according to Swami Yeti).\n\nI sincerely believe that if we don\'t take steps to Unite and Empower ourselves, we are heading towards a lot of Civil unrest and Civil war in this country.  We are ununited and our adversaries and many of the Politicians are united against us.  \n\nEveryone needs to see this important video by Swami Yeti:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04) It\'s about the current state of Hindus in this country and what we are heading towards!  Must See!\n\nPlease, please take steps to do something daily selflessly, from the Love of your Heart.  Even if 10 minutes per day.  If we don\'t do that, we will perish.  I sincerely believe that.  Get involved with us or get involved with the Swamijis.  Or find some other project that your Heart is drawn to.  It doesn\'t matter what you do, but do something from the Love of your Heart!  This is the path to creating New Bharat!\n\nI said something important yesterday:  "How many Hindus have the courage to stand up for the Truth, Justice and the Love in their Heart? Jitendar Tyagi stood up for them. That is why he made his movie and did what he did. Why can\'t we create a group of people who want to follow in his footsteps?"\n\nI sincerely believe that if we work together,  there is no reason that the Helpless movie will not go viral also.  Just like the Kashmir Files movie went viral.  And if millions of people in Bharat see the Helpless movie and understand Mr. Tyagi\'s story and understand what is really going on.  That will create New Bharat!  It will totally change this country!  So please, please do not be asleep.  Help us!  Help us take this viral!  Spread my yesterday\'s discussion post and urge everyone to see the Helpless movie and read Mr. Tyagi\'s story!  Please do it!  Please email it to everyone you know!\n\nIt\'s no longer time to keep sleeping.  It\'s time to wake up now and get active.  It\'s time to Unite!  And Empower ourselves.   We cannot be weak anymore!  The time for that is long gone now!\n\nDo what I am saying.  Work even 10 mins a day doing something selflessly from your Heart!  It can be anything!\n\nThank you!  Thank you!  \n\n\nPranam,\n\nBobby'<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'umxp4n'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/umxp4n/important_discussion_on_lets_create_new_bharat/</li>

In small amounts, it often leads to increase in productivity.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY: marijuana has incredible uses in pain management, where it can be used as a substitute for opioids to prevent addiction. People who were given cannabis as pain relief actually felt lower levels of pain and general relief and comfort, as compared to the withdrawal effects of drugs like morphine, febtanyl etc.\n\nMoreover, regulating ganja not only reduces crime, the quality can also be controlled to make sure it is not cut with other harmful drugs.\n\n\nSo my fellow indians, should we make ganja legal?'<br />Author: 'awkward_the_fish'  id: 'uma02m'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uma02m/what_are_your_views_on_legalising_marijuana/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'If you loved Kashmir Files movie, you will LOVE "Helpless" movie also! (on Pakistani Hindus!) You can See it here for Free! Absolutely Super movie! Please Make This Go Viral!'<br />Body: " Helpless movie was made by Wasim Rizvi, who did ghar wapsi to Hinduism and became Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi. He is currently in jail in Uttrakhand due to corrupt politicians.\n\nPlease first see the Helpless movie here (1.07): [https://youtu.be/DRf7fqhmbT4?t=344](https://youtu.be/DRf7fqhmbT4?t=344) (This is starting at 5:44 to skip the intro speech)\n\nThen please read the following post that I wrote a few weeks ago on IndiaSpeaks sub about the person who made this movie. This post is very important, so please read it fully (it will take only 5 mins to read!)\n\n\\-------------\n\n**Do you Love Bharat, India and Sanatani, Please read this post fully! This is a Must Read post for all Hindus and others who really Love and care about Bharat and our future! Please Help Make this post go viral!**\n\nNamaskaram,\n\nMost people here may know who Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi is. He had done ghar wapsi to Hinduism - he was previously the chairman of Shia Waqf Board and held a very high post in Shia muslim religion. His muslim name was Wasim Rizvi. He is currently in jail. Because he has done more for Hinduism, Hindutva and Bharat in current times than I think anyone else I know of, to awaken us all and to warn us about what he feels is coming in Bharat. And a very powerful lobby of Muslim politicians, the D gang and foreign money want him locked up forever or dead. His chances of getting out of jail anytime soon are very slim due to this lobby and politicians.\n\nAfter seeing many videos about him on Youtube, I was feeling very sad because no one was doing anything for him. I wanted to do something. I was thinking of a way to spread his story, to educate many people about who this amazing person is and what he was trying to do for us. I was thinking, is there a way for this to go viral so it can reach ??? maybe Vivek Agnihotri, Kangana Renaut, maybe wealthy Indians in other countries who care and want to do something.\n\nI sincerely believe that a renaissance or Spiritual awakening is happening and is very essential in Bharat. People need to wake up now and get involved (which is happening due to Kashmir Files movie, etc). We have got to wake up the Hindu masses and the national and spiritual consciousness. Because if we don't, I sincerely believe that we are heading towards civil war in this country. And a lot of hardship, misery or suffering for tons of people.\n\nI also wanted to share a few words about myself. My name is Bobby Luthra. I love Bharat and I thank God that I was born in a Hindu family. I am so, so grateful. I have been Spiritually minded since a young age (although not religious). I have lived outside of India since a young age, mostly in the US. Now I am in Delhi, taking care of my 92yo mother. I don't know and have never been involved with Jitendra Tyagi or the Hindu saints (Swami Yeti Narasimhanand, and Swami Amritanand) who appear with him in his videos. I have only been watching the videos online.\n\nI also know that a major shift in consciousness is happening in humanity in current times. All these accelerated global events that are happening since 2019 (pandemic, Ukraine war, being on brink of ww3, etc). Then all these events happening in Bharat such as Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots, the attacks on Hindu processions in 7 states and I have heard in over 100+ locations. And so so much more. What the heck is happening? I believe this is all part of the Spiritual awakening of humanity. The awakening is happening and so needed! I will talk more about this further down below.\n\nI am providing some must see videos about Jitendar Tyagi below. I believe Mr Tyagi has done everything out of Love, Truth and morality, to awaken all of us to the truth about Islam and Mohammed. He wrote a book about Mohammed when he was still Wasim Rizvi, by pulling together all the facts about Mohammed from authentic muslim sources such as Hadith, etc. Then he called all the Muslim religious leaders to debate with him about what was written in the book. Not one person came forward. He has never done anything out of malicious intent, only for the sake of truth. And for true caring and compassion and brotherly Love for everyone in Bharat.\n\nI also think that most Hindus and Sanatanis are asleep. We have little power left. No one in Bharat knows about Mr. Tyagi or cares to do anything about it. The Uttarakhand AAIMS doctors have said he is suffering from heart disease and needs to be out of jail because they can‚Äôt operate on him in jail. There is very good chance he may die in jail. He is still very young, I think in his late 40s. If no Sanatani comes forward and helps him, I think this will be a great injustice. And great shame on us! The 2 Swamis who are trying to help him have almost run out of money. We need people to step forward and act - and fight for justice!\n\nI am not involved with Mr Tyagi or any of these people. But I am a Spiritual person and I felt I had to do something. That is why I started working on a plan and writing this post. I did this only out of Love for Hinduism and Bharat. I received a Spiritual plan which I believe is magnificent. It will change tons of people‚Äôs consciousness in a massive way in Bharat. It‚Äôs an enormous vision! That‚Äôs why I urge everyone to read what I have written here totally. Especially if you are open to Spirituality or are being called to do something. Do not skip over anything I have written here. I believe this can reach a lot of people, and cause massive awakening in people. If you like this, please help this post and message to go viral! I am creating a blog, FB groups, Reddit groups, Twitter, Youtube channel, Instagram, etc, etc. I sincerely believe we all need to do something, otherwise Bharat is in trouble. I went within and asked for a solution, and this is what I received from Spirit!\n\nIf you are not too familiar with Jitendra Narayan Tyagi's story, then please watch these videos below. Please take the time to see them. Then please read below the videos about the powerful vision that I received for Bharat.\n\n**FIRST PLEASE WATCH THESE VIDEOS**\n\nWasim Rizvi becomes Jitendra Tyagi - What made him convert (10 mins)[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg)\n\nWasim Rizvi sharing his views on Mohammad and talking about his book to a Muslim anchor named Amber Zaidi. (55 mins) Every person including non-Muslims need to read this book by Wasim Rizvi about the truth about Islam and Mohammed. Wasim Rizvi wrote this book to awaken all of us in this great land! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls)\n\nManushi India about most recent news about Jitendra Tyagi and how difficult it is to get him out of jail due to the powerful lobby. (1.36 min)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd1B0MDsU8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd1B0MDsU8I)\n\nThis is also a recent video. These are letters being received by Swamiji from Jitendra Tyagi from jail. This video touched me so much and this is the reason I was motivated that I had to do something about it. That is how I started working on this post and my full vision. (1.12 min) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4)\n\nThis video is an interview with Swami Yeti Narasinghanand ji. How he sees the situation of Hindus in India &amp; globally. (55 mins) This is a must see video of the Swami who was responsible for Jitendra Tyagi‚Äôs ghar wapsi.

Please take the time - your future depends upon it!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04)\n\nI sincerely believe that 99% of the Sanatani or Hindu community are asleep. Because no one pays attention to what is really important that is happening. We have lost our true Power. Because we have lost our innate Spirituality. Spirituality is the essence of Bharat. All the great discoveries of mankind came from Bharat! Without the number 0, there could be no science, technology, engineering. Do you know that? Now I believe this country may go down the drain or be engulfed in civil war. That is why I am writing this and will be involved with this mission and to fully create this vision. To awaken as many people as possible! Please follow what I am doing and like my post!\n\nPlease join my Subreddit - Let‚Äôs Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0 (link is at bottom of this post)! I see New Bharat or Bharat 2.0 as Full of Love and Spirit! Our Power will come from that!\n\nI believe All the problems in our world and in Bharat stem from the fact that there is not enough Love in our country and world. Humanity has forgotten how to live in Love! Look at everything that is happening - the Pandemic, all the war and destruction. It has one root cause - not enough Love. Not enough Love. Can you see that? In my Subreddit on Bharat 2.0 we will impart simple ways all of us can restore Love or Divine Love back into our lives! I urge everyone to spend some part of every day focusing on something, anything you really Love! Something you can work on selflessly from your Heart because you truly Love it! Soon your life will start flowing with Divine Love! And our communities and nation also will start flowing with Divine Love like a massive river!\n\n(This is exactly how I started working on this mission to help free Jitendar Tyagi and wake up the masses! I am also a very busy guy. I initially hesitated. I felt what can I do? How can I do anything? But I felt I need to do this out of my pure selfless Love for Bharat and for Hinduism. This is like the Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Arjun and Krishna happened inside me. And I eventually surrendered to Krishna‚Äôs play or Divine Will.)\n\nWe are born out of Love and we are returning back to Love! Love is who we are! Love is our true nature! God is Love! Have you heard people say my religion is Love! This is what Bharat and our world is returning back to more and more now. All the chaos you are seeing currently will soon be gone! But we‚Äôve got to do our part. And fill our lives and mind and heart with Love! We have to do this daily! Work on something daily selflessly. Please, please do that! (If you can‚Äôt think of anything to work on selflessly from your heart, just spread this post! This can spread the Love and Light!)\n\nHow many Hindus have the courage to stand up for the Truth, Justice and the Love in their Heart? Jitendar Tyagi stood up for them. That is why he made his movie and did what he did.\n\nI urge you now to do 3 things (please do 1 and if you have more time do 2 and 3 also)\n\n**1** Spread my post to others - Everyone, please do this! This is the only part that I want everyone to do. Because we need everyone to start waking up now and start understanding what's really going on in Bharat! #2 and #3 are optional. Do them if you have the time.\n\nDon't worry if you don't understand anything right now. Just read it a few times and you will start getting it very soon.\n\n**2** If you have time, start going through more of what I am writing in my Subreddit ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0‚Äù Just start reading more and seeing the videos. Then you can learn more. Here is my Sub: [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\n**3** Start learning more of the methods I am teaching. They are very simple and powerful Spiritual methods. Like the 4 min meditation. This meditation is only 4 mins and it has changed my life! And I know this will change your life also if you learn it! (This helps in all areas of life - relationships, work, job, money, health.)\n\nPlease help the Swamiji‚Äôs to help Jitendra Tyagi! Just see the videos in this post above about how they can be reached! Please help them in any ways you can!\n\nI will soon be having zoom calls weekly also! And start talking about this type of stuff.I am feeling that currently we in Bharat have 2 choices. Either we move forwards towards total Love. Or total chaos and destruction. It‚Äôs our choice! My mission is to help people understand how we can move forwards towards total Love! (And joy and happiness and all good things!)\n\nIn my Subreddit, we also focus on spreading Sadhguru‚Äôs SaveSoil movement! That is also very essential! So please spread this post so more and more people join our Subreddit!\n\nThank you!\n\nPranam!\n\nBobby\n\n[r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)"<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'um5lw4'<br />Score:245<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/um5lw4/if_you_loved_kashmir_files_movie_you_will_love/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Shivsena why live in the heaven when you can rule in hell'<br />Body: 'I am not a Shiv Sena supporter and never was but coming from a Marathi guy, I\'ll be honest and put something in their defense. The Marathi people in Mumbai during those times (1960s and onwards) were dominated by Gujaratis, Marwadis, southerners, northerners and other trading communities in businesses and white-collared jobs. Even if Marathi people wanted to go into trade, rest of the communities would use clever means to monopolize and snatch businesses out of Marathi hands. In a Marathi majority city, people had nowhere to look for and had to live like sub-standard citizens in their own home city. What\'s more is that all those traders/business owners would put up their business names in their native languages instead of a language that everyone could understand. The money kept playing within their own circles and the Marathi community were sidelined and treated as a mere market. The emergence of Shiv Sena was important for Marathi people to get their self-respect back. Once this was achieved, Shiv Sena shifted towards a "Hindutva" stance where they would be able to get more popularity. Now I would have supported Shiv Sena if they were honest about the development of whole of Maharashtra but that\'s not the case. The Thackerays never really gave a damn about other regions of Maharashtra like Vidarbha and Marathwada (ironic since they idolize Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj). Their power was concentrated only around Mumbai and some of the coastal parts of Maharashtra. Had they been honest about their pro-Maharashtra stance, they would\'ve garnered more votes but instead they resorted to hooliganism and vandalism to enforce their dominance. Therefore, I would have supported Shiv Sena of the past had I been born then but supporting them now is completely out of the question. They\'ve realized they cannot overtake BJP on the Hindutva front so they simply resorted to the "why serve in heaven when you can rule in hell" idea. They\'ve completely discarded the Hindutva stance now as Aditya Thackeray openly challenged to overthrow Yogi Adityanath from UP. To fulfill their agenda, they\'ll even try to make AIMIM win. Their Hindutva is as authentic as a cunning fox preaching about ethics. BJP in Maharashtra is no better either but they still have the best chance to come to power in the future rivalled with NCP. Congress basically blamed 26/11 on Hindus and deemed it as Hindu terrorism. They don\'t DESERVE to come back. Currently, I don\'t see any party in Maharashtra who genuinely thinks about its people. 2024 is the best chance BJP will have to come back in full strength in Maharashtra. Hope it doesn\'t undergo an alliance with Shiv Sena in the future or else it will be doomed.'<br />Author: 'shashi_tharooor_1'  id: 'ulx71v'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ulx71v/shivsena_why_live_in_the_heaven_when_you_can_rule/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'how to write a sucide note'<br />Body: "#How to Write a Great Suicide NoteMake sure you leave a lasting impression on the world before you go.\n\nWrote it for my Kota friends preparing for jee but you could also try it.\n\nDo you want to kill yourself one day? Of course you do! With this being the beginning of another academic year for college students, why wait for the pressures of finals to get here when you can get it over with now and open up an additional spot in that worthless class of yours.\n\nBut hold on just a sec, don‚Äôt go and take a bath with an electric blow dryer just yet you crazy bastard. First, it's considered poor form to commit suicide until you've called this number and talked with a trained professional stranger one last time: 1-800-273-8255 (or\xa0live chat online, or text TALK to 741741). It's the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and it's free, confidential, open 24 hours. They'll listen and talk with you, and if you're still rolling your eyes after that, you can always hang up, your choice.\n\nNow, assuming you've called or you're going to right after this article, you have some unfinished business to take care of, which of course is writing a good suicide note.\xa0Wait no, a\xa0great\xa0suicide note. This is of extreme importance because the note you leave behind to your roommates will be the standard to how they will remember you, and will be the lasting impression you leave on this world. Below are guidelines on how to write a suicide note that would make any English major proud.\n\nGuideline #1: Be extremely brief.\n\nNo one wants to read a drawn out letter that just drones on and on. And most likely, you're probably not that interesting. So, in the letter, simply get right to the point‚Äîyou‚Äôll always leave them wanting more, which will drive people absolutely\xa0crazy.\n\nGuideline #2: Be funny.\n\nJust because you‚Äôre writing a suicide note doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have a sense of humor about it. Incorporate a joke or witty remark into your note. Here is one I might go for:\n\nGuideline # 3: Be cool about it.\n\nHow awesome would it be to know that even though you ended your life, you could still be really smooth about it. Here's what you should go for:\n\nGuideline # 4: Be mysterious.\n\nChances are, the person reading your note is going to want to know where your body is. Do something cool, like draw up a treasure map to where your body is with ‚ÄúX‚Äù marking the spot. Or do something as simple as this:\n\nGuideline #5: Have your note serve a purpose.\n\nAfter a suicide, people inevitably start blaming others and themselves for the misfortune. However, you can free all of your close friends and family of the guilt that it might've been their fault, and at the same time, help better society.\n\nWhat am I talking about?\n\nI‚Äôm saying you need to blame your tragedy on specific people, places, and things in society in your suicide note. This way, the blame will be placed directly on whoever was mentioned in the letter, and people will take strict action and put a stop to it. For example, write in your letter that you killed yourself because Tom Cruise simply would not shut the fuck up, or say that you simply could not live in a world where the show\xa0That‚Äôs So Raven\xa0or\xa0Keeping Up with the Kardashians\xa0is able to remain on the air.\n\nHere is a list of other people, places, or things to blame your suicide on, and help rid the world of these nuisances:\n\nRosie O‚ÄôDonnellThe WNBAVegansKanye WestNew JerseyAny ‚ÄúBody By Jake‚Äù productThe Lifetime ChannelFranceWhite Chicks\xa0on VHSWhite Chicks\xa0on DVDGuideline #6: Leave the number for Domino's Pizza at the bottom of the note with tip money.\n\nLet‚Äôs say hypothetically that it was your turn to cook dinner that night, but now, you‚Äôve left your roommates in the kitchen hanging, while you‚Äôre out hanging from the tree in the back yard. At least now they have a plan for dinner and call the pizza man. You will be remembered and thanked for this. When your friend says a few words on your behalf, he will say, ‚ÄúI will never forget the day my friend took his life. It was a Tuesday and we were able to order the 5-5-5 deal from Domino‚Äôs. We all got different toppings and you wouldn‚Äôt believe how much it hit the spot. Wait, what was I talking about before?‚Äù\n\nGuideline #7: Specify how you want your funeral.\n\nYour funeral is like your last big party here on Earth. You should be able to have it your way, just like Burger King! I personally want an 80‚Äôs themed funeral, with the song ‚ÄúTake Me Home Tonight‚Äù by Eddie Money blasting as my casket is rolled out of the church. I can‚Äôt wait!

Most where the Hindus are the victims, some where they have fought back.\n\nHindus seem to think the state leaking power is good, as they are in majority, they will have the upper hand. This is just a shoddy excuse for the ineptitude and tardiness of the so-called "right wing" government that uses Hindu lives for tactical political gains(not even strategic).\n\nThe lack of state monopoly on violence may seem very appealing when the person getting lynched is not a Hindu. \n\nWe have to accept some harsh truths about ourselves- \n\nWe are human after all, we are hypocrites, we are communal, we have caste, we all indulge in Schadenfreude when we are not the victims, we all use ideology as a substitute for robust policy, we make mistakes, we fall down, we rise up.\n\nBut we have to tread on, we have to be consistent, we need to eliminate distractions and not allow policy which aims to deliver instant gratification to interfere in hardcore calculated strategic policy.\n\nInstances like that of the 101 pandits in J&amp;K conducting their Pooja without permission from the government may look like a short term victory but these are long term strategic blunders. The "Rule of Law" doesn\'t seem to exist anymore, power seems to be up for grabs for whoever that wants it, rendering the country completely defenseless to foreign subversion tactics. \n\nWe seem to be living in a La la Land where we think we are winning just one the basis of a few tactical victories (Ram Mandir, Kashi Vishwanath, K\'taka Hijab row). While some of these instances do show there are still some proactive people left in the administration, almost all show symptoms of a decomposing state machinery at the helm of breakdown.\n\nWe are at the stage where we prefer polarization as opposed to nuance, strife as compared to peace, anger as compared to happiness. It is not our fault, but circumstances have forced us pick sides, to compromise, to do or die.\n\nIt is in this heat of the moment where the flight or fight response is triggered, hasty decisions are made, futures of civilizations sealed. \n\nWe must remember that we stand on the shoulders of giants. It is because of them that we even exist, but that doesn\'t mean we constantly look to the past for validation, we need to look towards the future.\n\nIntense deliberation in cycles is required, not based on ideology or philosophy but based on policy. There is no point in reminiscing about a great past when you have no plans for the future.\n\nAt this important junction in our history we need to decide what we want, where do we belong, and most importantly ,\n\nWHO WE ARE.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.'<br />Author: 'Born_Winter3904'  id: 'ulkfnt'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ulkfnt/the_state_is_leaking_power/</li>

He is moved by the horrors of  besiege of Chittor by bahadur shah which resulted in a Jauhar of 13000 Rajput woman.\n\nHe is inspired by the stories of war and bravery of his Grandfather Maharana Sangram Singh Sisodia aka Rana Sanga.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chittorgarh fort](https://preview.redd.it/a80sxaccfdy81.jpg?width=4208&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15bdba3e77aeed635f45834a0654dbd2e356885b)\n\nPratap becomes the King of Mewar in 1572 after the death of his father Udai Singh II.

Or is a guru supposed to dictate that based on his *viveka*?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany Hindu homosexuals believe that they should have the right to get married according to Hindu customs, even though a precedent of same-gender marriage does not exist in Hinduism. \\[[A Hindu conservative argument against same sex marriages: Religious sanction, dictatorship of the minority, and where does it end? (OpIndia - September, 2020)](https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/a-hindu-conservative-argument-against-same-sex-marriages-lgbt-homosexual/)\\]\n\nAlthough I remember reading in Alain Danielou\'s translation of the Kama Sutra that many homosexual men did get married to each other back then.\n\nRegardless, according to Smritis, Dvija people are not supposed to have homosexual relationships; and if they indulge in sexual acts with someone of the same gender and fail to do penance (*prayaschitta*) for it, they would lose their varna and become outcastes.\n\nBut still, many Hindu homosexuals in the West, and even in India, perform Hindu rituals in their wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7uk009f0by81.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e69570b55de304184b1afb3c9987cce1153fe043\n\nIf this is acceptable, then is it also acceptable when feminists refuse to conduct the *Kanyadaan* ceremony because it is "patriarchal"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r06iezns0by81.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16725044c750bbbbef0197deea43526e3367ddc1\n\nIf yes, then are people free to change traditions at their whims, with the justification that it doesn\'t harm anyone?\n\nTill what point can one continue to change Dharma in the name of progress? \n\nIs it possible that by doing so Hinduism would be so far removed from what it is actually supposed to be, that it becomes   irrecognizable?'<br />Author: 'itrupkapeed'  id: 'ul9e0i'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ul9e0i/does_hinduism_need_to_change_with_time/</li>
