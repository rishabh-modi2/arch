      <li>Title::: 'I just found another movie based on Kashmir Genocide, back in 2014 and its called January 2014'<br />Body: "[19th January](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3585456/?ref_=ttls_li_tt). Does anyone know about this? Or have you seen it?\n\n&gt;The concept of Kashmiryat assumes its real meaning in the film which reveals the real story of Kashmir. It is a cry of mourning, the wail of a widow, the dumb shriek of a motherless child. The iron curtain has finally been lifted and a harsh reality lurks in front of us like a naked corpse. The film captures the socio-political reality of contemporary Kashmir and debates the causes of eradication of the ancient cultural heritage of this mini diverse civilisation. It also depicts Kashmir without her original children - the Pandits. The flight of migratory and wounded birds is the main motif in the film. The film is based on the documented account of the actual events which be occurred in Kashmir between 1989 and January 1998. It states that neither it was hindu nor the muslim who suffered on the unfortunate date of 19 January 1990 but it was the humanity which suffered. The story told through the eyes of a nationalist muslim professor, Bashir Ahmed, a professor, a humanitarian has got so moved with the psychosis of Kashmir valley that he doesn't have trust on his own kid. In the morning he refuted the fundamentalists and terrorists in front of his son but when finds that his son is not at home takes that his son is the informer of terrorists and thus spends the whole day in this fear that his son will bring the fundamentalists and will kill him"<br />Author: 'blackrock-orange'  id: 'tdqb36'<br />Score:75<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tdqb36/i_just_found_another_movie_based_on_kashmir/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Why India should embrace Hinduism and stop being secular nation. I am a big fan of Mr Balaji Vishwanathan who write on Quora. His answers are always mix of new insights and clarity. I am pasting one of his answers here with the reference.'<br />Body: 'https://balaji.quora.com/My-most-controversial-opinion-https-www-quora-com-Whats-your-most-controversial-political-opinion-answer-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9C%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B8%E0%AF%8D?ch=10&amp;oid=60994979&amp;share=69f85601&amp;srid=XKaT&amp;target_type=post\n\nMy most controversial political opinion is that if India stops being a Hindu majority country it would implode into a bloody civil war to create dozens of warring nations. If Hindus lose their grip, things could get worse for all other religions of the nation.\n\nIn 1947, India was divided into two nations — one with a Hindu majority and another with a Muslim majority. They shared the same genes, culture, language, history, geography. Despite all the commonalities most non-Muslims from the newly created Pakistan chose to move to India. Not just the Hindus, but the Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsees etc.\n\nPakistan not only became toxic for non-Muslims it also became embroiled in strong sectarian currents between Shias and Sunnis. India sees very little of Shia-Sunni conflict. The only key difference is that India has a Hindu majority.\n\nWhile India does see some communal clashes, the per-capita distribution of religious victims is lowest among the world.\n\nIf Hindus stop being the majority, they would have to be replaced by someone else. Atheism would not be that one. That experiment was tried in Russia, Cuba, China etc before the majority start moving to one or other religion. Other Dharmic religions also cannot take that, leaving only the Abrahamic religions to grow.\n\nIf the proportion of Muslims and Christians grow higher, there is a threat to that balance. As both religions are fast expanding by nature, they get into bloody conflicts — think Lebanon, Nigeria etc. If there is no Hindu majority in the middle, things could get worse for both communities as ambitious leaders on either side would try to get their domination.\n\nAnd it is also Hinduism that is the key force that connects Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Gujarat to Manipur. Without that our commonalities reduce substantially. And we stop being a nation. And any threat to it also would change Hinduism into a lethal one. We don’t want our mandirs to be taken over trishul carriers who use excuse of protecting the religion for their violent actions.\n\nThis why I see preservation of Hinduism as a national duty. Weakening of the religion would see dramatic dangers. We should preserve and respect the boundaries of each religion and pay a strong attention to any change in status quo.\n\nSometimes people these concerns are excessive. They say change in demographics is small. I see this akin to rising sea levels. The ocean could be 5000m deep. But, it rising by 1m can have grave consequences. The same way a 5–6% drop in Hindu demographics can have unpredictable consequences.\n\n\nThe population of Christians is quite understated and no one knows the real figures.\n\nHinduism has its own faults. We are in the age of kali — of corrupted religious ideas that must be constantly cleaned. We need to completely banish untouchability and other and aspects of the religion. Despite those faults, the religion is a desirable thing to have. The structure needs correction, not demolition.\n\nWhat I desire is a Gandhian hinduism — a religion that is firm, confident and non-threatening. You do your fasting, pujas, reading the Gita, while still respecting everyone else’s religious ideas. Like an elephant that doesn’t hunt other animals nor gets hunted.\n\nHowever, that version of Hinduism is under threat. You don’t see that sitting in a posh area of a major metropolis. Far from the main cities I have seen the demographic changes in action and that worries me. Indian elites don’t care about those, but if you don’t pay attention to those forces things can get ugly for everyone.\n\nOne Meenakshipuram incident turned Hinduism fairly aggressive. Deeper missionary activities in Indian villages — Odisha, Andhra and elsewhere — would squeeze the space of moderate Hindus like me. The hardline Hindus would take up arms and turn the religion aggressive, inward looking and devoid of spirituality. If we don’t have a honest, national conversation on this demographic change, we get to see an outcome that would be very violent.\n\nWhat is the way forward?\n\nI don’t want people to misuse the demographic change to bring their own biases. Here are some of the things I want to clear.\n\nMuslims have more children. While this fact is true, part of the factor is less to do with religion and more with economics. Many of the Muslims live in poorer regions such as Bihar/UP etc and lack access to proper education and healthcare. If you adjust for economics, the difference is not as pronounced. More education opportunities for the women and economic growth can partly arrest the growth.\nIslamic regions are violent. Again, it is a generalisation that is untrue. Middle east was violent before and after Islam. More to do with geography than religion. Outside that region, Islamic countries — such as Malaysia or Indonesia — are not any more violent than their neighbors.\nPeaceful resolutions works with Buddhists, but not with Muslims/Christians. This irrational fear must stop. Indian Muslims have been a fairly peaceful lot and there are various ways to resolve issues with traditional negotiation. The problem is that educated Hindus have often shunned their religion and didn’t help in these ways. Think of the Ayodhya issue. A brilliantly educated Hindu — lawyer Parasaran — was able to get through to the end of a centuries old conflict without further bloodshed. If urban, educated Hindus can understand the issues without prejudice, they can broker piece with the other communities.\nChristian missionaries change the tribals. The missionaries succeed because mainstream Hindus ignored the tribals. In Meenakshipuram the Dalits were making a statement by mass conversion. Can we Hindus look to address the upliftment issue of tribals and Dalits so that there is a lesser incentive for people to move out.\nThe key is to respect each religion, understand their insecurities and issues, and help solve the issue. The Gandhian method is that if you fix the problem within, you don’t have to pick a weapon.'<br />Author: 'theseeker299'  id: 'tdq2i9'<br />Score:128<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tdq2i9/why_india_should_embrace_hinduism_and_stop_being/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why USA is equally responsible, if not less than Russia for the war in Ukraine'<br />Body: 'TLDR: Ukraine fell into the hands of dirty politics of USA and Russia. \n\nPoland Slams US Reports As ‘Misinformation’; Says No Fighter Jets For Ukraine But Ready To Help Refugees. Poland has made it clear that it will not send any fighter jets to Ukraine, underscoring considerable ambiguity over the scope of the European Union\'s military assistance to Kviy and NATO\'s unity. \n\nSource from Polish ministry\'s Twitter handle :https://twitter.com/PremierRP_en/status/1500345167211114497?s=20&amp;t=3J4F20USovIfQuz5fXoweQ\n\n\n Poland has realised that this war hasnonly been started by provoking Russia. Had the US never implored ukraine to join NATO, this war would have never happened and peace would have prevailed. To add support to this analysis, a young Joe biden in 1997 himself said the same thing, that russia will only attack europe if nato starts aggressively expanding. Heres the link to his interview\n\n (You might want to download it before it "magically disappears" and becomes "misinformation".\n\n\n https://youtu.be/dNgCwoaT9u4\n\n\n FOR THOSE WHO DIDN T UNDERSTAND, JOE BIDEN IS SAYING THAT ADDING BALTIC NATIONS TO NATO WOULD BE A DANGEROUS MOVE FOR US-RUSSIA RELATIONS AND WOULD BRING ABOUT A HOSTILE REACTION FROM RUSSIA. \n\n\nAnd eventually baltic nations were indeedbadded to NATO under the Bush administration. What is clear is that Joe biden himself knew that if we keep expanding nato, if we keep adding countries that share a border with Russia to NATO, we will face some heavy consequences and today that very same Joe biden is going against his own beliefs when in power (almost as if its not him but his strings puppeteering him).\n\n\n And eventually, the Russian reaction came in 2022. However, this in no way implies that russia\'s reaction is justified. But we cant ignore the fact that US influenced NATO and biden\'s disastrous foreign policy is in part also responsible for this. AND now, poland, a nato country itself has started alligning itself towards a neutral stance by stating that US is spreading fake news because of fears of its own security, for it too shares a border with Russia and also because of USA\'s double edged policies.\n\n\n\n\n Had it been someone else, they wouldn\'t have let kabul fall, then kyiw and now record high inflation occur. Its almost as if this is being done on purpose. Remember, Biden was not elected as a democratic president, he was elected for removing Trump.\n\nWhy does west and Europe keep insisting ukraine to join nato when russia has clearly stated many times in the past that expanding nato threatens our security and peacefully requested USA to stop expansion until now when nato forces would be directly at the russian border if Ukraine is admitted, due to which Russia had no choice but to use force (which is not the right way to solve this issue btw). Why does the west only care about their self interest, just like they did in Afghanistan, middle east and Vietnam, Korea and Libya?\n\nWhen the same thing was happening in Cuba (where Russia would have had direct access to America), America forcefully overthrew the government of Cuba and got pissed off.  Now when it\'s Ukraine that\'s the epicenter, Russia can also care for its self interest, just like america did during the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nAmerica has always cared about its own interests, from Mujahideens to Saddam Hossain to Vietnam to Korea to attacking India in 1971 against genocidal pakistan to Balkan wars to so so much more.\n\nThe real answer is that all these countries, from Afghanistan, to Cuba, to Vietnam and today to Ukraine fell into the dirty and polluted power politics hands of USA and RUSSIA. Now one country is using voilence while the other is using sanctions that do nothing except make the common russian suffer, both of them trying to save face and blame the other side'<br />Author: 'randomdudeonthe'  id: 'tdhbuo'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tdhbuo/why_usa_is_equally_responsible_if_not_less_than/</li>

I left India in the early 2000s and haven’t returned since 2006.\n\nThis Russo-Ukrainian war has plunged the Indian community here into chaos. We’re naturally friendly towards the Russians and we’re also very non-communist in our social values. With India refusing to support the US at every level at the UN and news that India may work around the sanctions on Russia has generated severe “anti-Indian” sentiment.\n\nRecall the anti-French sentiment during the run up to Iraq when Villeneuve was the mascot against Powell and Co. We all know that turned out to be a massive lie/excuse to go destroy a country. \n\nI was raised in India for two decades - born and raised in Pondicherry. I’m a Tamil and ever since I was 3 I recall I was exposed to Russian romance - the first story I can remember is Ivan and the firebird. Then my family had subscriptions to Russian kids books and magazines like one that was called Misha (which I vividly remember)\n\nMy parents also grew up in post-independence India where the USSR was our “only reliable friend”\n\nTo me, India and USSR/Russia are like Karna and Duryodan. Karna knows Duryodhan and the Kauravas are the arch-antagonists of the good forces. Yet Karna continued and even died in the process. Not to say that the west is akin to the Pandavas because the West as corrupt and soulless as the Soviets.\n\nSo I cannot bring myself to be Russophobic, even though I feel for the people of Ukraine \n\nAnd I also find the anti-Indian sentiment comical because the US populace does not have a good grasp on history - it’s a largely a product of a severely backward and indoctrinated school system that does not teach real geography or history - the education is intended to keep their populace stupid and philosophically aligned to American imperialism. Like they truly believe it when Obama or GW say they are spreading “freedom”. \n\nWith this context, I want to know where the Indians stand. Are they aligned with Modi on his cautious approach (is the opposition, such as Congress, also aligned with Modi?)\n\nI have been following the Hindu, the print and Indian express and they seem to have a subtle western bias in their reporting. Much of their news is sourced from NYT and the Guardian and the WaPo which are mere echo chambers of the US state department.\n\nMy biggest concern is if the NYTimes propaganda somehow percolates down to the reporting of the Indian press.

      <li>Title::: 'My thoughts on The Kashmir Files'<br />Body: 'Watched it last night in Hyderbad. I got drunk and didn\'t finish this post. So publishing it now.\n\nIt is not a film in a traditional sense. The ending is abrupt. The camera work was decent at best. Even if you are the type that watches movies occasionally, you could tell that the film making was raw. After thinking it over, I felt it could be that there were some constraints to this endeavour. It is also a documentary that shows what happened and how things came to be into today\'s situation.\n\nThe story telling, however, shined and came through. This is the most important part in my belief. Every actor felt quite natural playing their part. There are already many praises for Anupam Kher, Mithun Chakravarthi and others. I have loved the actors portraying Pushkar\'s son and daughter-in-law however brief their part was. The actor playing Krishna was, IMO, peaking , with his acting, toward the end with his self-discovery and realization. That was what made me want more toward the end. I also wished they could show some more about article 370 and Pushkar\'s vindication, in a way of speaking. More of what happened to the professor or what the professor did could have been shown. No complaints though.\n\nBeing part of reddit for a long time, I have read about most of the incidents. Most of it was just validation of what I already knew. Still, it was a good way to imprint on the mind of what happened. This should not be forgotten. This is something that every Indian should watch. I am a south Indian with no connection to what happened. I used to identify as a "liberal" for the longest time. What use is being called a liberal, if you don\'t open your eyes to the truth. So, what does and south Indian "liberal" doing watching this film and writing about it? Ever since I realized that all these divisions are being created in the South, I had made the connection that eventually your history will be replaced and you will be laughed at for saying "I want to preserve our culture". It is happening now, but subtlely. There is one ( from my recollection of posts on telugu subs) emotional person who realizes "bhaiya mana culture enti asalu" and while there are people who support that guy, many others simply dismiss it as overthinking etc. So this all awakening and realization is very true, deep  and close to my heart.\n\nComing to the theater, I could see half of seats empty. Initially I was a bit disappointed then I realized, some might have bought and did not come to watch. I also almost gave up going, but just 30 minutes before the show, I took a bath and went straight. After watching the film, I resolved to buy at least three or more tickets. I will watch again.\n\nI see comments that \'we are scared now\' \'we don\'t want to watch\'. Despite some of our intellectuals calling them weak hearted and other words, I will say it is okay to be scared. There is gore, violence and unspeakable actions shown on screen. Remember to remember that this is a real history of Kashmiri people. If you chose to stay away, buy tickets and don\'t go. Or buy for someone else. Remember the history, else it will repeat. Stay home thinking this is hard to watch, it is fine. However I implore you, thinking this is all false propaganda. That is something as a character in the film says is an action of a coward.\n\nDon\'t make any comments on being "liberal", not that I don\'t want any negative comments, but because I abhor the notion of identities in favor or real humanism, you know Vasudhaiva Kutumbam and all. I only love the identity of "liberalism" in that human free will and choice of living their life must be protected. Not the type you see on SM and mainstream media. They are leftist-pseudoliberal-communist-m group(s) that just want to break us apart.\n\nI also wish to see the directors edition on Prime or other OTT.

      <li>Title::: 'What exactly is a naya paisa?'<br />Body: 'As many of you might know, there is a common phrase in Hindi, एक नया पैसा नहीं मिलेगा (*ek naya paisa nahi milega*; not one new paise will be given). The implication of this phrase was that naya paisa or new paisa was the tiniest unit of currency, with 1 naya paisa being really small. Have you ever wondered what exactly is a naya paisa, and what happened to the purana (old) paisa? Read on to find out!\n\nIn today\'s world, unless you are from the US, Liberia, or Myanmar, you are used to using powers of 10 to express everything except time and geometric angles. For example, 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 1 centimeter = 100 meters, boiling point of water = 100C, etc. This concept, of expressing all weights and measures in multiples of 10, is called *metrication*. The equivalent concept when dealing with currency is called *decimalization*. The idea of decimalization ("decimal" literally means "of tens" in Latin) originates in ancient India, where the decimal system of numbers was invented and from where it spread outward. In the modern era, in 1585, it was a Flemish engineer named Simon Stevin who advocated that weights and measures be expressed in multiples of 10 to make hand calculations less error-prone. However, it mostly remained an idea in the deep trenches of technical work for a long time. \n\nPrior to metrication/decimalization, everything was typically expressed in multiples of 12 or 16. For example, 1 pound = 16 ounces, 1 foot = 12 inches, etc. Two aspects of this are still widely used: a circle is divided into 360 degrees (a multiple of 12), while one minute consists of 60 seconds (again, a multiple of 12). Why these numbers? The answer is not clearly known, but it goes back to ancient history, where the Sumerians (perhaps the world\'s first civilization) used multiples of 12 and 16. This continued into the modern age, until the French Revolution. This marked a turning point in history, as the new French Republic aimed to change everything - including how people counted. They enthusiastically adopted metrication, with Napoleon further pushing it even after the French Republic collapsed. And indeed, once merchants and businessmen came to realize that metrication did indeed reduce calculation errors, the idea acquired a life of its own, culminating in the modern SI system of units. \n\nBut what does this have to do with a naya paisa? You see, it wasn\'t only weights and measures that benefited from metrication - so did money (in which case it is called decimalization). For a long time, money was also expressed in fractions, sometimes very strange ones. For example, until 1971, 1 British pound = 20 shillings, and 1 shilling = 12 pence. Australia, South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand followed an identical system. So for example, the cost of something in the old system may have been 2 shillings and 8 pence, so if you only had shillings, you\'d have to pay (2 + 8/12) shillings... you can see why it got complicated. In India also, during British rule, the Rupee was divided into 16 annas, one anna into four pices, and 1 pice into three pies (so 1 pie = 1/192 Rupees, I told you the numbers got strange). Although in practice, 1 Rupee was quite a big value and you could do a lot in just annas and pies, but in commercial and government-related areas where big values *were* used, it was a complicated system that led to a lot of accounting errors. \n\nDecimalization involved abolishing these sub-units of money and replacing them with something that was related to the main unit by a simple multiple of 10 (usually, but not always, 100). As far back as in 1704, Imperial Russia decimalized its currency, setting 1 ruble = 100 kopeks, and about a century later, after the French Revolution, Republican France introduced a new currency, the franc, which was subdivided into 100 centimes. The newly-independent American colonies adopted a new currency, the American dollar, and dived straight into decimalization, with 1 dollar = 100 cents (which is ironic, since metrication of weights and measures has mostly been abandoned in the US as of today). Over the next 200 years, country after country decimalized their currency. In the process, many of them created a new currency as well: the South African pound was replaced with the rand in 1961 after decimalization, while the Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian pounds were replaced with the respective dollars in the 1900s, each subdivided into cents. The British (and also the Irish), as usual, took their time: it wasn\'t until 1971 that they officially decimalized the pound, abolishing shillings and pence for the new pence; 1 British pound = 100 new pence. \n\nAnd that should give you an idea about the naya paisa. In 1955, Parliament adopted the Indian Coinage Act to decimalize the Rupee (the next year, it adopted the Weights &amp; Measures Act for metrication of everything else but time and geometric angle). By 1957, the stage was set and annas and pies were demonetized and replaced with a naya paisa, with 1 Rupee = 100 naya paisa. 1 pie was approximately 0.5 naya paisa (25/48 naya paisa to be exact). This is where the term we all know from movies and grandparents comes from. Seven years later, in 1964, the "naya" part was dropped and the official sub-unit became paisa, which we all know today. Most of you may have also seen 1 paisa coins in your lifetimes, although they were officially demonetized in 2011 and are no longer legal tender. \n\nOn a concluding note, why aren\'t angles and time metricated? Angles actually are to a limited extent, with a unit called a gradian being valid units in navigation, mining, and land surveying in Europe. 90 degrees = 100 gradians, so a full circle is 400 gradians. However, gradians haven\'t proven to be popular outside of Europe, and the SI unit for angle is actually a radian, which is almost never used outside of technical fields. As for time, the French did propose to metricate it: the base unit would be a day, with time expressed in (sub-) multiples of it: centidays, kilodays, and so on. But the idea never became popular. Why? Probably because, unlike everything else, the concept of time is inherently tied to the rotation of the Earth, and unfortunately, it doesn\'t work very well in multiples of 10. Indeed, the base-60 concept of time that we have goes back to the Babylonians from the written record, which is probably the second-oldest civilization after the Sumerians. So that\'s a *really* old system that nobody really wanted to give up - although Internet time and Julian dates are metric concepts that are used today in specialized areas.'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'tcyndr'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tcyndr/what_exactly_is_a_naya_paisa/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is there any way you see West Bengal make economic progress in the long run ? (from a frustrated bong)'<br />Body: "As a rare bong without 200 IQ and a chauvinist bent, it's increasingly becoming impossible to contemplate any future timeline where WB does not continue to be a national cancer in my lifetime and drag big and wholly innocent states down with it, especially so if Mamata lives on for five more years. Let's be honest here, what does WB offer (except the incredible spectacle of three-penny intellectuals and third-rate poets who fantasize on screwing each other's wives in open soc media platforms) ?  \n\nBig manufacturing : No, we are arty folks, we don't like factories much, and the public intellectuals who were the  opinionmakers of Bengali deindustrialization are the same ones holding up the current regime. Seriously though, Mamata's government is financially broke and can't offer sweeteners in large enough scale to move the needle, even if it suddenly wanted. For scale, the largest Indian company by mkt cap which has majority of production capacity (not corporate offices and legacy factories) located in WB is a $300m microcap company producing pipettes and petridishes for labs. For scale - their annual revenue is &lt; 0.03% of Reliance. Let that sink in please (and even that is wholly led by Punjabi entrepreneurs, but let's not get into that).\n\nBig service : No, India's startup capital has moved decisively to Bengaluru just as finance did to Mumbai in 1890s. Sector V is just a sweatshop, of which there are plenty already - and that's before accounting for wfh taking over.\n\nBig Agro : No, legacy of the great land-reform, land is locked in microparcels. Co-operatives were the only way you could, at least in theory, make anything off them. But given how Mamata is armtwisting precisely these existing co-operatives (already reeling from NPAs) into giving idiotic loans for student credit cards -  there's zero chance of that happening.\n\nTourism : Has there ever been a place with 10 Cr+ people that prospered with tourism as their main industry ? Besides, internal infra is not very good (no metro from airport yet fo example) and so is law and order. Darjeeling is a touristy place, but political disturbances, resulting from local groups demanding statehood and our govt playing them off against each other, routinely leads to stoppage of tourist flow to Darjeeling. \n\nHere's the most important thing though, generations of bongs has grown up used to throwing cheap racist slurs at UP-walas and Biharis while these were precisely the hinterlands that provided WB with trading depth. Now, with Western and Eastern DFCs done, western UP is rapidly industrializing in a way that leaves the entire logistics chain largely independent of WB and eastern UP will eventually tap into that channel within a decade.  That leaves only Bihar and NE to bully around. NE will eventually find a trade corridor with Bangladesh. That leaves Bihar as the only state dependent on WB - sorry Biharis, you're fucked. \n\nTo reiterate, I simply can't see no light at the end of this tunnel. This isn't a question of Hindu vs Muslim or CPM vs TMC in any of this - everybody had a chance, everybody made the situation worse and worse.  Yeah, we still have white youtubers praising Ray's movies to jack off to - but that's about it.  \n\nIs there anything that you see differently ?

Capex in 2014-20 was of 6.45 lakh crore which was higher than capex of 60 years from 2014-20.\n\nIt is also promoting Make in India by developing fully made in India trains such as Vande Bharat. 95 percent of of electric loco components are sourced from India. We are also exporting 7 diesel locomotives to Sri Lanka.\n\n Electric locomotive was fully made in India for first time in 2018 and since then 100s of such locomotives have been produced. \n\nCleanliness standards have seen a massive improvement. Over 1.8 lakh bio toilets have been built since 2014.697 stations have mechanised cleaning systems. Coach Mitra service allows passengers cleaning of coaches via SMS. \n\nSteps were taken to improve safety. For the past 2 years, Indian Railways achieved its best ever safety performance. \n\nIndian railways is also trying PPP model which I support.\n \nIndian Railways is a shining example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. \n\nIt is on its way to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2030.'<br />Author: 'MasterpieceUnlikely'  id: 'tcn78g'<br />Score:65<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tcn78g/transformation_in_indian_railways/</li>

Otherwise, we will just be stuck in a middle class economy forever. If you are a country of 1.3 Billion, you need processes and systems to make sure we can track the growth and move fast in decision making based on numbers. \n\nFor example, Aadhar is one of the best things that happened in India.

However, many are playing politics on this and conveniently blaming INC for this. There is much to blame (esp. Nehru\'s role early on), but this is a lie. KP genocide occurred on the watch of VP Singh, who was a Janata Dal candidate (S. Swamy\'s party), with the BJP as the junior partner. \n\nYes, where were these people when this was happening ? Don\'t tell me it didn\'t concern them - BJP leaders in Kashmir were one of the first to be the target of the killings.\n\nForget junior role, we\'ve seen BJPs castrated stance when it comes to Hindus killed be in Bengal, Kerala or in Delhi itself. Their inability to pass education reforms, while keeping anti-colonial intellectuals out of the system is itself a performance to behold.\n\nRemember the dialogue: "govt. may be theirs, but the system is after all ours". The system is what led to their genocide. Soon after the KP genocide, about 100,000 Hindus were driven away from Bhutan, and were not even granted asylum in India. The Bhutanese Hindus were forced to live in refugee camps in Nepal, from where they were flown into US (to fulfill refugee quotas), where their "souls" are harvested. Have you even heard of this ? \n\nThis is the true nature of the Delhi regime. Modi or not.

Had watched this first day but was waiting for the right frame of mind to put down my review\n\nKnowingly or unknowingly I have seen and followed most of Vivek’s craft over the years. I was a fan of Saturday Suspense show on Zee and some stories really struck me hard and would live long with me after the episode ended. I watched Cholocate when I was in college and I didn’t know initially it was inspired by Usual Suspects. By then I knew the end but still it was a very engrossing movie and all my friends who hadn’t watched Usual Suspects were amazed in the end reveal. I watched Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal because I liked couple of it’s songs and though the climax was cheesy, it was a very tight movie overall. I watched Hate Story for my own reasons, and there was neither good erotica or suspense. Later I watched Buddha in a traffic jam and was bowled over by the subtle messages and “show and don’t tell” approach of the movie and recommended it to everyone.\n\nThe Kashmir Files suffers from one issue which The Tashkent Files also suffered from. Vivek directs his scenes well, the narration is gripping, the movie holds you tight, but many times it seems to be reaching nowhere. The story is moving but with no purpose.\n\nThat said, that is the only problem I had with the movie. And because I have seen his Buddha in a Traffic Jam or Chocolate, I understand that probably his movies based on documentary like structure are more of an issue than his own shortcoming.\n\nPerformances are top notch. Mithun never disappoints, and Anupam Kher is the pick of the actors. He has put in all hid pain of so many years on celluloid. Pallavi Joshi is an actor par excellence but imo, Vivek gives his wife very monotonous roles, they follow one simple arch and have no character growths when she has a huge potential.\n\nChinmay Mandlekar is a great find, he is bone chilling as the cold and unapologetic Bitta Karate. There is an interview of real like Bitta Karate where he admits he killing many Pandits point blank on head and he would do it without mask, open in day light in full public view, with all the support of locals and that scene is translated very well in the movie.\n\nThere is a huge political tone in the movie but that is something which you cannot ignore or hide or pretend doesn’t exist. Before the exodus Kashmiri Pandit leaders also used to say “we are not Indians, we want our own land”, and after exodus, they all lost their own lands.

      <li>Title::: 'Personal Finance: · What is Budgeting?'<br />Body: 'Personal finance refers to how an individual manages his/her finances. Financial management is a skill which takes time to master. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp))\n\nAs personal finance is a big topic, this will be broken up into different parts. This second part we will discuss about budgeting\n\n# What is budgeting?\n\nBudgeting is the process of creating a plan to save your money. This simple plan is called a budget. This plan is to ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your expenses.\n\n[https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/budgeting/what-is-a-budget-planning-forecasting](https://www.mymoneycoach.ca/budgeting/what-is-a-budget-planning-forecasting) \n\nLet’s say (Example) :\n\nCar-AMD is an IT engineer. He earns Rs 100,000 per month. His expenses are as follows:\n\n· Food : Rs 5000\n\n· Shopping: Rs 1,000\n\n· Transport : Rs 3000\n\n· Loans and others: None\n\n· Rent: Rs 30,000\n\nDo you think he has enough money to cover his expenses?\n\nLet’s work out:\n\nExpenses = Rs (5,000 + 1,000 + 3000 + 30,000) = Rs 61,000\n\nIt is clear he has enough.\n\nLet’s have another scenario:\n\n· Food: Rs 5000\n\n· Shopping: Rs 90,000\n\n· Transport : Rs 3,000\n\n· Loans and others: None\n\n· Rent: Rs 30,000\n\nIn this case, he is having a negative cash flow of Rs 28,000. In this way, he needs to relook at his expenses.\n\nTo do budgeting, you need to do the following:\n\n \n\n|Step 1|Check your actual income and previous   months expenses|Let’s stick to Car-AMD example. He spent only Rs 3,000 on transport   and Rs 5,000 on food in January 2022. Then he should make a provision in the   following month i.e. February 2022. But this does not take into account any   future rise in costs.|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Step 2|Create a plan|Let’s say Car-AMD boss said you   will earn Rs 100,000 only. He will need to budget based on   previous months expenses. If we look at Scenario B, probably   he needs to find out what are his needs and wants. He could probably cut down   shopping to zero. No need to shop  |\n|Step 3|Monitor and take steps|It’s mid of Feb and realized that   he spent Rs 900 on food and Rs 1000 on transport. He decides to curb his   spending. Since his office is 15 minutes away   from his house, he decides to get electric scooter.|\n|Step 4|Check if you have met the   expectations from your budget||\n|Step 5|Repeat||\n\n# What are the wants and needs?\n\nWants are something you desire to have. For example, you want to buy Apple iPhone 13. But you can afford Samsung Galaxy S20FE.\n\nNeeds are something you need for survival like food and water. If you are doing fasting, then you still need food.\n\nSo in this series we discussed about needs and wants.\n\nThat’s all from me.'<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'tcc00s'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tcc00s/personal_finance_what_is_budgeting/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My message for the Sikh brothers'<br />Body: 'I browsed the Sikh subReddit and found that there’s a lot of hate against India, Hindu and the Indian government here. For instance, a video of a road rage (a kid dying in an accident) was posted where a Sikh man was being beaten by the crowd and it was labled as as “Hindus beating a Sikh because that’s in Hindus’ blood. If you are honest to yourself and somewhat aware, you know that when people get involved in accidents in India, they fight like idiots and a lot of times, the buses are burned and the drivers are assaulted by the public (if a death is involved, it’s inevitable that mob will go crazy). This happens regardless of the religion in India. But you can pick up any incident and put a religious lens on it, and use it to propagate hate.\n\nI grew up with Punjabis (Jains) and Sikh friends. There was a reasonable level of harmony and I never felt that we are from different religions. It’s only very recently that I discovered this hate among these communities. And I see it only growing! \n\nAll said, my heart pains and my head pounds with anger when I think about either Jaliahwala Bagh, or 1984 genocide. But you know it wasn’t a Hindu conspiracy against Sikhs. It was Rajiv Ghandhi and his men against Sikhs. Instead of killing Sajjan Kumar and Tytler, the Sikhs spent so much energy on killing some innocent Hindus. It’s not revenge! No innocent Hindu ever supported genocide. My dad, who was out on one of the days when the whole thing was unfolding and was stuck in the riots, still gets nightmares about the scenes he saw at the platform. \nWhy should there be haterate among common people for the actions of some goons?\n\nAnd clearly, there are a lot of anti-India elements who are enjoying and fueling all this hate.\nWhy Khalistan when India is yours? Why hate Hindus when we follow similar principles. Why can’t we go-exist peacefully and focus on getting the real culprits punished! \n\n\nI don’t know where it stops, but I know this will continue. Only a few from each religion will eventually reach enlightenment, the rest will anyways keep fighting for something or the other - that’s the game!'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'tcbzgz'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tcbzgz/my_message_for_the_sikh_brothers/</li>

Shamli - 3 seats - all 3 seats lost by BJP.\n5. Kairana - Rioter Nahid Hasan from SP won.\n\nWe have already seen this pattern in West Bengal. Kerala and other states in India.\n\n10 - 20 years later the above statistics will apply in all constituencies in India, unless we demolish the root cause of this. It is not only that Muslims have voted as a block in these elections, the muslim vote bank was increased as part of a conspiracy after the advent of CAA:\n\n1. There has been a multi-fold increase in birth registrations (almost all fraud) by Muslims.\n2. Once a fake birth registration is done, voter id card is made by fraud. There have been cases found where the same person had 20 voter id cards in Meerut.\n3. The muslim vote share has been doubled in many areas in the last 2 years.\n4. Many muslims from other states of India were specifically brought to UP for casting vote. Only a very few of them were actually from UP. \n\nTo see how this large scale racket operates watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdcUeUS\\_vT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdcUeUS_vT4)\n\nThis is the part 1 and the other two parts are on youtube too.

      <li>Title::: "How does one accidentally fire a supersonic missile? It doesn't make sense, here's why"<br />Body: '1. The firing of a missile system involves a preparation process, the identification of a target and toggling of multiple switches. It cannot happen accidently.\n2. And for top-end missiles like Brahmos which this is alleged to be, there will be even more things that need to be done before launching. It costs Rs 25 crores per missile. Very expensive. These are not left in the control of a single person ever.\n3. These type of missiles have a self-destruct button, which could be pressed incase it malfunctions or goes in wrong direction for exactly these purposes. Why was it not pressed?\n4. Then, the distance between launch site and the crash site is over 200 kilometers. And it course corrected in between too. What a coincidence that out of 360 degrees, it exactly went inside pakistan.\n5. The photos shared by Pakistan looked like the second stage of the Bramhos. Is it possible, that the actual missile went for much more distance and struct its objective. Something like Balkot? And only the second stage fell here. Even after the second and first stage gets separated, due to inertia, it will keep flying for lot of kilometers. Pakistan admitting this one doesnt have any warhead/explosives also indicate that it could be the booster stage.\n6. Even during Balkot, Indian govt had not come out and said we did such a thing. Instead it was Pakistan which came out and said. And then India went along with it. At that time it was said that if Pakistan had kept quiet, we would not have spoken of it either.\n7. The timing is also a bit of coincidence. It was done just one day before election result came out. Thus news of this incident can come on only the day after, and entire media will be focused on election result.\n8. The location from where it is alleged to be launched, doesnt have a Brahmos missile facility, but Brahmos is transportable by truck and can be launched from anywhere.'<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'tbub9i'<br />Score:133<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tbub9i/how_does_one_accidentally_fire_a_supersonic/</li>

And in the next election, BJP didn't have any choice other than offering the same free schemes to Delhities. BJP didn't won and the reason behind that could be better governance by Kejriwal even If I don't agree with it but what matters is Bjp was forced to change it's manifesto.\nThe point is simple. From now on, not a single party would be able to think about winning elections in Punjab and Delhi without these Free schemes. \nFrom now on, governance would be the second factor to win the elections and free schemes would be the first.\nFrom now on, even AAP would be losing the elections if they will think about getting rid of these schemes no matter how good their government would be in those five years. Just because BJP and Congress are going to offer the people what they want.\nSoon this will happen in every single state of India.\nCongrats."<br />Author: 'Beginning-Kick1946'  id: 'tavmqa'<br />Score:257<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tavmqa/honest_rant/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Kingdom of Kolathunad'<br />Body: 'https://imgur.com/gallery/pKzNwMr\n\nKolathunad was a post-Chera kingdom in medivial Kerala, India. \nAfter the disappearance of the Perumals or the Cheras of Mahodayapuram in the twelfth century, the\npolitical formation in Kerala took a different turn from the other parts of South India. The\nemergence of the institution known as the ‘swarupam’ as the focus of political power in Kerala after the twelfth century was a significant development in the history of Kerala.\n\n\nThe origins of Kolathunad\n\nThe Kolathiris(kings of Kolathunad) claim their origin from the legendary Mushika\xa0dynasty. The Mushikas ruled North Kerala and were probably the descendants of the ancient royal family of Ezhimala and were perhaps a vassal of the Cheras. Some scholars have expressed the view that Mushakas were not under the Cheras, since the ruler of Mushika does not figure along with the rulers of Eralnadu and Valluvanadu as a signatory in the famous Tarisappalli and Jewish Copper Plates. They intermarried very frequently with some of the Muvendhars(3 Tamil dynasties).\xa0The Mushika family has found mention in surviving Hindu Indian texts like the\xa0Vishnu Purana\xa0and also in Greek accounts like that of\xa0Strabo.\n\n\nRise of Kolathunad \n\nUp to the 11th century, the Mushika kings followed patrilineal system of succession. Its  said that after the Nāgar/Nāyar invasion(under Banaperumal) through Tulunad during the Rashtrakuta times, Nair male soldiers and accompanying females got settled there. Over time, the higher subcastes among Nairs started marrying into the Kolathiri dynasty. This eventually shifted their inheritance pattern into the Nair system of Marumakkathayam. \nWhen the competition was less, the Kolathunad grew to the zenith of their power in 15th century. They did trade with Arabs, Portugese, Dutch, Konkanis and Gujratis. \n  \nThe Royal flag of the Kolathiri family was a combination of\xa0, Naandakam Vaal(A type of Kerala sword)and Nenmeni-vaka(A type of native flower). Its said by their legends that Parashurama helped in their coronation(maybe an allegory) and gifted them the Naandakam Vaal.\n\nNow, after few centuries, the king of Kolathunad had a desire to reclaim their Kshatriya ceremonies and rituals, whose rights they had lost long ago when they married with Nairs\xa0and\xa0adopted\xa0matrilinear\xa0system. The Namboothiri priests refused to do anything for him. So the Kolathiri decides to undergo Hiranyagarba. For that he brought Brahmins known as Sagara-Dwijas, from Gokarnam. These Brahmins happily performed Hiranyagarbam for him, and over time they adopted Namboothiri customs and culture and settled in North Kerala. They are thought to be the ancestors of Embranthiris. \n\nSince then, the Kolathiri Rajas possessed the title Perumal as part of their imperial name. Also, the Kolathiris are praised as Vadakkan Perumals ("Kings of the North") by the noted "Keralolpathi.\n\n\nDecline of Kolathunad\n\nBy the seventeenth century, the Kolaswarupam had to share its political authority with two other\nlineages in North Kerala. The Nileswaram Swarupam and the Arackal Swarupam claimed independent political identity. Moreover, political power within the Kolaswarupam was also disseminated into different kovilakam. \nZamorins military conquests too played a part in reducing the size and stability of Kolathunad. But it was the Mysorean attack who sounded the death-knell for this kingdom. When Mysorean troops invaded, Kolathunad’s neighbour, the Arrackal Kingdom helped them. This caused many royal members of Kolaswaroopam to see temporary asylum in South Malabar. The ones that remained mostly fought to death or were captured and taken to Seringapattanam. Most of their royal mansions and palace were destroyed. Only a small portion still stands today, bearing testimony to their decline….'<br />Author: 'Cheralatron7'  id: 'tao9p9'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tao9p9/the_kingdom_of_kolathunad/</li>

They will end up joining Pak or China (either by choice or by force)\n\n2. They will become Kashmiri Islamic Caliphate (posts by most Kashmiris on several platforms confirms their dream of it) - the whole narrative of "Kashmiris are ready to welcome KPs back in valley", "Kashmiris are tolerant to non muslims" is bure BS only uttered by Indian liberals. \n\nSo, basically these so called progressive intellectuals are supporting either the secession of Indian territory to enemy countries or they are enabling the creation of Islamist anti-minorty Caliphate. (Worst part is they include Jammu and Ladakh in their evil plan)\n\nSo, I can never respect someone who support this Azaadi and self determination BS. \n\n\nIn my opinion, best solution is to make Kashmiris understand the futility of their fight, ask them to coordinate with the central government and then help the government in bringing peace and development to the valley.\n\n\nBut these "Kashmiri allies" should be held respect for supporting kashmiri bloodshed (of both civilians and army) when they can have peaceful existence in one of the most beautiful part of the world.'<br />Author: 'aarti1409'  id: 'tae7k0'<br />Score:63<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tae7k0/heres_what_it_really_means_when_one_supports_self/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I find it really strange that India (and Hindutva) are considered intolerant and anti minority when'<br />Body: "The problems are only against 1 minority (+0.5 Christianity). We invited the Jews in and peacefully lived with them. The fleeing Parsis were welcomed with open arms. There's basically no history of intolerance against Buddhism and Jainism (Shunga aside, who was the exception that proves the rule). Even the early Christians (before missionaries and British) like Nestorians were welcomed. Tribal religions have no problem.\n\n&gt;India has given refuge to followers of persecuted religions across its history. In the post-classical period, sanctuary was granted to\xa0Hebrew\xa0Jews\xa0who fled captivity in\xa0Babylonia,\xa0Aramaic Christians\xa0who fled the\xa0Islamic invasion of Syria\xa0in the 7th century, and\xa0Persian\xa0Zoroastrians\xa0who\xa0fled persecution\xa0in\xa0Persia\xa0in the 9th century following the\xa0Muslim conquest of Persia, as a result, India has the largest population of people adhering to Zoroastrianism (i.e.\xa0Parsis\xa0or\xa0Iranis) in the world.[6]\xa0In the 20th to 21st centuries, sanctuary was granted to Russian, Persian and Afghan Jews,[7]\xa0Christians, Jains, Sikhs, Hindus, and Ahmadiyyas who fled\xa0persecution in Pakistan, Hindus and Buddhists from Bangladesh. When the\xa0Dalai Lama\xa0fled\xa0Tibet\xa0and took refuge in India after it was invaded by\xa0China, many Tibetans followed his example and continue to seek refuge in India.\n\nMost Hindus have a live and let live relationship with religion.\n\nYet it is only with 1 religion that we have problems (plus missionaries, which I'll discuss later). This religion has since the 7th century gone on a rampage and destroyed every culture between Morocco and Afghanistan (A distance of 8,500+ kilometres), which includes some of the same people India gave refuge to. The religion subjected Hindus to a 700 year long dark age of brutality and oppression, nearly eradicated Buddhism and Jainism in the subcontinent. But even then during British period and after many of us were happy to live in peace with them. But they refused and killed us in genocides like Mopla and Direct action Day riots. After cutting off some of our most historic and holiest places, they cut off more than 1/3 of our nation. And even now they threaten to kill us in 15 mins like Owaisi.\n\nThe other religion Hindus have problems with is Christianity. And even then we have no problems with normal Christians, but with missionaries. The same missionaries which destroyed the Sub Saharan African, Native American and Pagan European religions. And they come to spread their poison here too.\n\nSo, after reading all that, why is it India, why are Hindus branded intolerant?"<br />Author: 'TheMountainRidesElia'  id: 'ta61pj'<br />Score:583<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ta61pj/i_find_it_really_strange_that_india_and_hindutva/</li>

Well, Konark is derived from “kona” (corner) and “arka” (sun). This temple is dedicated to Sun God. It's a well known UNESCO Heritage Site in Odisha.\n\nBut the question I had in my mind while writing was should I write about Surya or Konark Sun Temple? I will post about Surya in the later posts.\n\n**What’s so special about the Konark Sun Temple?**\n\nThis temple was built in 1244 by King Narashima Deva I. There are many stories which share one common thing that Samba, the son of Lord Krishna built the temple to worship the sun to worship Surya for 12 years. He believed in Samba because it cured his leposy disease.\n\nThis temple has some interesting stones engraved on it. Let me quote this from go2India:\n\n“There are 24 wheels fixed to the temple and is of 9 feet 9 inches in diameter and they are having 8 spokes. All stone wheels are full with engraved art works. Out of 24 wheels 6 are in either side of the main temple, 4 wheels are on each side of the Mukhasala and 2 wheels on each side of steps at eastern front. The 24 wheels signifies 24 hours of a day and the 8 spokes signifies prahars ( three hour period ) of a day.”\n\nThis is quite true. When I visited the Konark Sun Temple, I saw how shadows indicated the time of the day through the stones of the chariots.\n\n**Was Konark Sun Temple destroyed or collapsed?**\n\nThis question is very difficult to answer. The answers are conflicting. \n\n**Coincidence or not?**\n\nA few kilometers down, Puri Jagannath Temple was built also. Lord Jagannath and his other avatars were believed to be incarnation of Lord Vishnu, frequently identified with Lord Shri Krishna. \n\nThis is why Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, especially with ISCKON have put Lord Jagannath as one of the Char Dhams.\n\nBut many should visit the Konark Sun Temple as a tribute to Surya. Tribute to Surya is done in yoga through Surya Namaskar.\n\nBesides being in the currency notes, the chariots and horse statue of the Sun Temple is in the Odisha Government emblem.\n\n[From Odisha Government Site](https://preview.redd.it/c1p1kohk8am81.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698454328fbe26eb05251dfc8f2cef534d6369e1)"<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'ta3c82'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ta3c82/the_konark_sun_temple/</li>

In my view this should be promoted to sunnis in india.\n\nBahai was born in iran out of shia islam. They believe in the unity of all religions, in that all are true and each religious figure, be it krishna, zoroaster, Buddha, jesus etc were all 'manifestations of God'. They formed a new religion with close ties and practises to shia Islam since it came out of Iran, as in the way they pray, festivals etc all have roots in shia Islam. They believe hell is a state of mind along with heaven. They also believe in the unity of science and religion. They also believe that education should be promoted as much as possible. They were persecuted in Iran and today most of bahais live in india (example: Delhi lotus temple is for bahais).

I don’t want to talk to you.”, really touched a nerve. These thankless people are blaming the government for not being able to send officials into a war zone in a foreign country (earlier, now I see news that buses have been arranged to transport people to the border) to rescue them. Some of them were pissed why they had to travel to the border and why not evacuated from within Ukraine (saw a student interview on Zee). Assuming that Indian government can walk freely into another sovereign country at war and pull them out (sounds like a Rambo movie), makes me just wonder. Rather than being thankful that india is one of the few countries that actively worked towards bringing their citizens back safely, they are pissed that they had to sleep in a common room and that the embassy couldn’t manage food for all students, even though this was a crisis the embassies don’t deal on a regular basis?

But now that most people have been evacuated, I can’t stop myself anymore. \n\n1. each one of us knows who really goes to Ukraine to study. It’s the people who are absolute failures and can’t make it to countries with some standard in education after they fail to get either US, UK, Singapore or India. The next options are really so many developed countries in Europe, Australia, Canada. Ukraine is for absolute failures. Yet, the attitude and arrogance I’m seeing in their videos and interviews is appalling!\n\n2. I saw a vlog of a guy who, along with his fellow students was ridiculing the Indian govt and media on the advisory and warnings that were issued in early Feb. In his later blogs, he’s complaining about govt.’s incompetence in rescuing them.\n\n3. I also heard a student (the one whom Scindia welcomed) saying something like it’s India’s fault because we abstained from voting against Russia at the UN that their rescue became harder. Are they really expecting Indian govt to change its long term strategic position just to ensure that it’s easier for us to rescue a few students (long term position has a potential impact on billions of Indians living in India).\n\n4. I saw students returning from Ukraine with our minister trying to welcome them with a rose and them just straight out disrespecting him. I really felt that those folks should’ve been packed into the same flight and sent back to Ukraine.\n\n5. Clearly, the Indian govt. has made a lot of efforts to ensure the safe return of these students despite them not hearing their advisories to evacuate earlier. They shouldn’t expect us to send our military to rescue them from the cities - that’s akin to participating in the war. Some students are even suggested that we should have sent one representative per city to coordinate their evacuation. So they reckon their life is more important than those representatives.\n\nIt’s the time for Indian parents to realise that their kids basically fooled them in the name of “phooren” degrees by going to such countries as Ukraine and are basically low aptitude, arrogant brats who don’t deserve to burn their money!'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 't9g386'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t9g386/indian_students_in_ukraine_the_failures_who_are/</li>

While China is well known for its large economy and military in current times, that wasn't always the case. Back in the 1950's and 60's, China was a fairly poor country, and their isn't much evidence to suggest their military was significantly powerful back then. Similarly, while India was also a poor country that had just got independence during this period, the Indian military  would have surely had some experience or skill that they would have learnt from the British. Based on all these factors, you would think the Indian army could have put up a serious fight against the Chinese army during that time period. However, the war barely lasted a month, and was ultimately won by China.

And none of these countries are blaming their citizens even if their advisories showed far more urgency.  \n\nLet\'s take a look at just few of these  (these came 3-4 days before the Indian advisory)   \n\n- **The British Govt\'s advisory which came on the 11th Feb**   \n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-nationals-advised-to-leave-ukraine-immediately\n\n&gt; British nationals currently in Ukraine **should** leave **now**\n\n- **German advisory on 12th Feb**      \n\nhttps://www.thelocal.de/20220212/germany-calls-on-all-citizens-without-imperative-reason-to-leave-ukraine/\n\n&gt; Germany on Saturday advised German citizens without an "imperative" reason to stay in Ukraine to leave  \n\n- **Netherlands - Feb 12th**      \n\nhttps://nltimes.nl/2022/02/12/dutch-govt-tells-citizens-leave-ukraine-soon-possible\n\n&gt; Minister of Foreign Affairs Wopke Hoekstra is calling on all Dutch nationals to leave Ukraine. "The security situation, which was already troubling, has deteriorated further over the past few days. In consultation with various allies, I am now taking the step of calling on all Dutch nationals to leave Ukraine"\n\n- **Australia - Feb 12th**    \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/12/scott-morrison-urges-australian-citizens-in-ukraine-to-leave-immediately\n\n&gt;Scott Morrison urges Australian citizens in Ukraine to leave immediately as Russia conflict looms. Australian prime minister says advice to citizens in Ukraine is ‘very clear’   \n\n- **USA - 12th Feb**        \n\nhttps://www.state.gov/a-senior-state-department-official-on-our-diplomatic-presence-in-ukraine/\n\n&gt; Now these developments mean for private American citizens that it isn’t just time to leave Ukraine; it is past time for private citizens to leave Ukraine.\n\n\nAs compared to the Indian advisory that said students **may** leave if it\'s not essential that they stay, the American advisory which came 4 days before said - it\'s **past time** to leave Ukraine.  \n\n\n----\n\n**What happened next from Indian Government**    \n \n\n**16th February**    \n\nAnd several students wanted to leave but there weren\'t enough flights. The Embassy also knew this - \n\nhttps://twitter.com/IndiainUkraine/status/1493903111152455683\n\n&gt; The Embassy of India has been receiving several appeals about non-availability of flights from Ukraine to India    \n\n&gt; To meet the additional demand, more flights are being planned in the near future   \n\n\n21st February, Modiji Govt said they are going to arrange 4 additional commercial flights &amp; asked the students to book those flights - these flights were Ukraine International Airlines \n\nhttps://twitter.com/IndiainUkraine/status/1495820054482542604\n\nThese 4 extra Ukraine Air flights were scheduled to be on 25th Feb, 27th Feb (2 flights) &amp; 6th March. The war started on 24th Feb, so I don\'t think these flights happened. \n\ni.e. there seemed to be no urgency to the response even on 21st Feb. May be Modji should have been sent with a few Air Force flights or commercial flights atleast between 21st &amp; 23rd to evacuate them.   \n\n---\n\n**The second fake narrative which is being floated is that after the 24th, all other countries told their citizens that they are on their own &amp; abandoned them &amp; India is the only one who evacuated it\'s citizens**.    \n\n**Most countries including India evacuated it\'s citizens after 24th** - no country could because the airspace was closed after the 24th - that\'s what the other countries conveyed in their advisory after the attack started - that they cannot evacuate the citizens &amp; citizens should make their own efforts to get to neighbouring countries like Poland, Romania etc. This is exactly the same thing India said, except India started labelling people getting out of Poland, Romania to India as an "Evacuation". \n\nGetting people out of a war zone is "Evacuation". Taking people from non-war countries to India is "Ferrying".\n\n---   \n\nAnd even after the 24th, many countries still made a lot of effort to get their people from Ukraine to neighbouring countries by arranging buses, cars &amp; other transport.   \n\n\n- **Bulgaria evacuated it\'s citizens from Kyiv, Ukraine** (26th Feb) \n\n[Two More Busses Sent to Evacuate Bulgarian Citizens from Kyiv, Three Already Left for Bulgaria\n](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/227387-two-more-busses-sent-to-evacuate-bulgarian-citizens-from-kyiv--three-already-lef)   \n\n- **Malaysian embassy evacuated their citizens from Kyiv, Ukraine** (25th Feb)\n\nhttps://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2022/02/27/last-group-of-nine-malaysians-evacuated-from-ukraine-says-wisma-putra\n\n&gt; The group left Kyiv by road on Friday (Feb 25) evening and entered Poland on the night of Feb 26.

Initially, 13 Taiwanese citizens and their spouses boarded the bus to be transported to the western city of Lviv.\n\n\n- **China evacuated it\'s citizens from Kiev &amp; Odessa** (March 1st) \n\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1253558.shtml\n\n&gt; China evacuated the first batch of its citizens from Ukraine on Monday, including over 400 Chinese students from Odessa and 200 from Kiev.\n&gt; They traveled by bus to neighboring Moldova, with escorts of embassy staff and local police protecting them for the entire ride.\n\nSo, a few other countries actually evacuated/help evacuate citizens from Ukraine. And this is not an exhaustive list - this is just quick googling I did. And as far as I know, India hasn\'t evacuated or help evacuate anyone from Ukraine yet. \n\n---   \n\n**Previous evacuations**     \n\n**2006 Lebanon evacuation during 2006 Lebanon War**   \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sukoon\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, 4 ships from the Indian Navy sailed to Lebannon &amp; evacuated 2,280 people including 1,764 Indians were evacuated. 112 Sri Lankans, 64 Nepalese and seven Lebanese nationals with Indian spouses were also evacuated. They were taken to Cyprus &amp; from Cyrpus there were special Air India flights which brought them to India.    \n\nManmohanji was Prime Minister   \n\n**2011 Libyan Civil War evacuation** \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Safe_Homecoming   \n\nIndian Govt used Naval Ships, charter ships, Air India flights, Chartered flights to evacuate Indians 15,000 Indians from Libya (not from neighbouring countries). \n\nManmohanji was Prime Minister  \n\n\n**1990 Kuwait Invasion evacuation**  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_airlift_of_Indians_from_Kuwait\n\nAir India evacuated 1,17,000 Indians from Kuwait from Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.  \n\nI think PM was VP Singh  \n\n\nFor that matter even Modiji knows what an evacuation is - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Raahat  - done during the Saudi Arabia invasion of Yemen in 2015.\n\n\n-------------\n\nThis is not to say Modiji Government should have evacuated Indians from Ukraine. There wasn\'t a way they could do that. But  \n\n- They should stop calling the drama they are doing as Evacuation. They are ferrying people from peaceful countries. Could have been done by a travel agent from SOTC or Cox &amp; Kings with help from the Indian Embassies in those countries. SOTC would have even taken along an Indian cook to cook alu mutter for the students while they are waiting for the flight &amp; would have probably even taken them to see the Ram Narayan Mandir in Poland. And they wouldn\'t even behaved inappropriately with Indian female students. \n\n- They should have issued an urgent advisory on 12th Feb, like other countries did &amp; not a casual advisory like they did on the 15th.  \n\n- They should have helped organize buses for the students from Ukraine to neighbouring countries.'<br />Author: '_Standard_Pumpkin_'  id: 't8kvfe'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t8kvfe/operation_ganga_the_evacuation_that_never_existed/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Found this on Reddit. What do you guys think of this'<br />Body: '**Here is a viral WhatsApp message doing the rounds in India.** Just sharing ..\n\n_____________________\n\n\n**Vladimir Putin didn’t just invade the Ukraine on 24/02/2022, he officially ended the petrodollar system.**    How? Remember, Russians don’t do anything without a plan. They &amp; China have been prepping for this moment for years &amp; are now ready: \n\nRussia has stated NATO expansion \ninto Ukraine was a red line. \n\n-They knew their invasion of Ukraine would be inevitable and would have strategized that the US/West’s response would be SWIFT $ system exclusions/sanctions. \n\n-Reasonable to expect that Russia’s next step would have been to shut off oil/gas pipelines to Europe, as Russia has built up huge Yuan, gold &amp; commodity reserves. \n\n-This will cause massive price and supply disruptions (war level) to the western markets &amp; monetary system. \n\n- For years Russia &amp; China have looked for ways to re-monetize gold &amp; exit abuses of SWIFT system as a geo-political tool against them, but how to do it, how to exit, without West declaring it an act of aggression or war against West? \n\n- This Ukraine invasion just accomplished that end for them. \nAnd the West is doing it themselves. \n\n-Now, freed to declare themselves SWIFT system outcasts by the western govt hands, Russia can now say “we will turn oil pipelines back on, but not for dollars.” \n\n- Russia then declares that Europe or anyone that wants Russian oil (as 3rd largest global producer) or Russian/Ukrainian wheat (1/4 of worlds production) must pay in gold, or use the ruble-yuan gold backed payment system. \n\n- Their leverage as an oil producer (who cuts off supply) will cause almost immediate price shocks to the western world. A good part of the population could immediately be unable to heat their homes. \n\n- Almost equal to the oil shock they’d cause is their ability to cause food shortages and price spikes through the disruption of wheat production. \n\n-Unmentioned in all this is China. Who has been silent &amp; not condemned Russia.That means silent approval &amp; cooperation. \n\n- China will act to soak up Russian production of oil and wheat to soften the blow to their “strategic partner”. \n\n- This will again be through the Yuan-Ruble facility and at some point overtly-stated gold backing of that system by Russia and China. \n\n- The West will of course declare those last two bullets as acts of global aggression and direct threats to the “world monetary system”. \n\n- At this point that there will be a clear fracture of the world’s monetary system into 2 competing East/West\xa0 structures, circling back to the initial point that the 50 year global petrodollar system has just officially been ended by Putin. \n\nIf the above analysis is indeed correct, then the threat to the petro-$ is no different to the time of Charles De Gaulle or Gaddafi, but on a far larger scale. They can\'t remove Putin as easy as they did with previous leaders who challenged their fraudulent petrodollar monetary system.                   *Interesting analysis on removing Russia from SWIFT system:*\n\nWhat are the consequences of US &amp; EU kicking Russia off SWIFT System?\n\nWill it hurt Russian Economy? Economists like Raghuram Rajan want you to believe this.\n\nBut, Removing Russia from SWIFT could be exactly what Russia, China and India desire. \n\nWhy? Read on.\n\nSPFS (‘System for Transfer of Financial Messages\') is a Russian equivalent of the SWIFT financial transfer system, developed by the Central Bank of Russia. The system has been in development since 2014, after US Govt threatened to disconnect Russia from the SWIFT system.\n\nThere are plans to integrate the SPFS network with the China-based CIPS (Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System). \n\nIf either of those then interconnect to Bharat\'s SFMS …..\n\nCan you imagine the effect?\n\nIf Russia is removed from SWIFT, the blow to the US economy, and especially that of EU would be enormous.  The vast majority of SWIFT transactions are settled in US dollars, which helps solidify the US currency status as the global reserve currency.\n\nThis gives the US tremendous influence over the world economy, therein lies the real power.\n\nIf Russia + China + Bharat come up with an alternate system to compete against SWIFT that will be a competing currency transactional system and it’ll further weaken the US dollar.\n\nNot to mention Russia is the second largest exporter of energy and China is the largest manufacture exporter with Bharat fast catching up.\n\nThey could start their own economy &amp; adopt existing partners such as African countries (largest precious mineral producer) and Saudi Arabia (third largest energy producer) putting Europe and United States economy on back foot extensively.\n\nBy Removing Russia (one of the biggest oil producers) from Swift, USD will be DESTROYED as global currency as oil,most traded commodity in world, is paid in USD.\n\n If "forced to leave SWIFT", Russia will expand SPFS internationally, and nations that intend to keep importing Russian oil &amp; natural gas will have to join Russia’s new banking transaction system\n\nAnd you know that Russian Gas is cheapest which no-one can afford Not to have.\n\nIf Russia breaks from SWIFT, watch for China &amp; Bharat to announce same. We are actually watching the destruction of the USD taking place be4 our eyes.\n\nOther countries will be more than happy to assist with this New System which gives them a chance to improve their currency.\n\nStart looking for words “Eurasian Union” to appear in articles very soon. We are getting closer to the new digital economic system and global digital currency soon.  What is horrific is that developed countries [US etc] will drop from having 80% of World\'s income to 35%.\n\nOrdinary Americans calling for Russia to be ejected from SWIFT, do not realize that US uses the dollar to borrow at discounted rates, that debt is $30Trillion as of today, so if the dollars’ influence is reduced, US transactions would be much more expensive.\n\nUS economy will be on verge of destruction while paying interest elements only.\n\nWhile costs for businesses would pass on to US consumers, Americans would have to then pay more for everything. Are they ready for that? Are US politicians &amp; companies ready for that as well?\n\nDo you still think that President Putin acted in haste with Ukraine Offensive?\n\nEverything is calculative &amp; pre-planned.\n\nAnd....If you still think that PM Modi discusses with Putin about ONLY safety of Bharat\'s citizens in Ukraine....\n\nThen may God bless your Innocence.🙏🙏'<br />Author: 'BlueFlame__'  id: 't8j2cd'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t8j2cd/found_this_on_reddit_what_do_you_guys_think_of/</li>

Probably a lot them. I know for a fact that several thousand Indians give up their Indian Citizenships to become a Canadian citizen each year. I am pretty sure same happens in Europe and in some other countries. Now the moral dilemma is: should India spend a lot of it's resources on someone who is planning on giving up the Indian citizenship very soon? \n\nAgain, let me reiterate, I truly believe that India should have evacuated these students.

      <li>Title::: 'The land of the original casteists – a brief history of horrible birth-based and discriminatory caste system that still exists in Britain to this day'<br />Body: '  \n\n&gt;**“Britain is the most class-ridden society under the sun.”**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- George Orwell\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you ask any teenager entrenched in the Indian education system the question – “who eradicated the caste system in India?”, the answer they will regurgitate will be - the British.\n\nAh, the British, the exporters of civilization to the land of “savages”, from South America to Africa to Asia. Most youth to this day believe that Britain ended most of the societal ills of our country with their unique brand of colonialism. The same people believe that these white men were literally gods among men, that they lived in utopia back home in “Great” Britain. That back at home in England, all the lands the queen ruled, no inequality existed. And why would they not think like this, especially when Britain has postured itself as the “white savior” for the rest of the uncivilized world.\n\nThe truth is that Britain probably had one of the most oppressive caste systems in history. It was so oppressive that it would make the Indian caste system and American racism look like petty household squabble.\n\nAnd Britain’s caste system still exists to this day. No effort is made to eradicate birth-based privilege. Their people are so brainwashed that they truly believe that the “royals” are indeed better than the regular people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A brief explaination of how the caste system in Britain works across the ages – \n\nThe terminologies change across the ages, but the system is still the same. In the regency period, the people were divided into \n\n***Cottagers*** – These were the manual labourers. **They were not allowed to own land** and lived and died doing manual labour.\n\n***Husbandsman and Yeoman*** – They were allowed to hold a little bit of land. **But most of their earnings were given to the upper castes.**\n\n***Gentry, Baronet*** – These were birth-based titles given to upper caste British people only. They did not work a single day in their life and **lived their lives on the earnings of the lower-caste British people.**\n\n***The royals*** – Consisting of titles like Duke/Duchess; Marquess/Marchioness; Earl/Countess; Viscount/Viscountess; Baron/Baroness, **these royal titles were handed to people by birth and these titles exist to this very day.** They owned huge estates and did not work a single day of their lives.\n\nIn the subsequent Georgians and Victorian eras, the lower working castes were consolidated into a single group, while the no-peer hereditary castes were consolidated into the aristocrats who served the royals.\n\nThe uppermost caste of royals remained the same and exists to this day. The royals of England still own billions worth of real estate, and the line of succession is still alive and respected in modern Britain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# We will begin with the conditions the lower castes of Britain lived in the past –\n\nIn the middle-ages, the average life expectancy of the lower caste British people was 13. Yes, most of the lower caste British died before the age of puberty – the life was so bad for them. In comparison, upper-caste of royals lived into their 30s and 40s quite easily.\n\nEven in the Georgian Era, in the 19th century, **life expectancy of the lower-caste British people, who lived in the cities was less than 15 years of age.** These lower caste British people used to do manual labour for the upper-castes and died doing it. Middle-castes lived into their 40s, the same as the upper-castes British people.\n\nIn the Victorian Age, the Industrial revolution brought in development into the lower-caste people, even though their life was bad. **The lower caste usually resorted to child labour with children as young as 5 going off to do manual labour away from their families**. The industrial revolution did not bring respite to this caste of people and social mobility was out of question because the upper caste in Britain was still determined by birth and not ability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The pathetic living conditions of the low-caste British people compared to the luxuries that the upper-caste British people enjoyed and enjoy to this day –\n\nWhile Britain was struggling with the first call for independence by the Indians in 1857, the living conditions back home in Britain was no less than horrifying for the lower castes.\n\n**There were no gutters, so rotting streams of feces flowed freely into the streets on major cities.** Most of these streams were more than 6 inches deep by many accounts. Bricks were placed on the streets so that people could walk across them. Literally shit on the streets.\n\nMuch of the housing back then would be sub-terrain and **a lot of this liquid septic feces would leak into the cellars where the lower-caste British people would sleep.** Their toilets did not have doors either and they conducted their private business out in the open.\n\n**80 percent of the population which consisted of the lower-caste British people, worked all their lives for 14 hours a day for little to no money.** This was purposely kept this way to keep the lower-caste British people oppressed.\n\nMost residential places were crammed with people and diseases were rampant and bathing was unheard of in the low-caste British people.\n\nWhile the low-caste people lived in squalor, the upper-caste aristocrats and royals lived an opulent life.\n\nMost of the royals lived in huge mansions with acres of estate around it. Internal decorations were made of gold and silver and silk.\n\nEven the middle-caste British man could afford a lavish house in the city where such pathetic living condition did not exist.\n\nThe upper-caste brainwashed the lower caste so efficiently that the lower-caste British people believed that serving the upper-caste British people was indeed a privilege.\n\nThis attitude of subservience to upper-caste British people exists to this day with super-hit TV series like Downton Abbey still a rage among the British people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The horrors of lives of low-caste women and children of in Britain – \n\n**Children would be put into hard labour and worked a back breaking 12-18 hours a day working in coal mines, chimney sweepers, and on farms.** Most of these low-caste children rarely saw adulthood. **57% of children would die before they reached 5 years of age.**\n\nWomen were also worse off. They had no rights in Britain. Low-caste women were treated worse than even the children. They were not allowed to take up jobs. Their whole life was dedicated to raising children and preparing food. Female mortality rates among the low-caste British households was more than 40 percent.\n\nIn comparison, the **female mortality rates in upper-caste British household was a measly and shocking 0.2%.** That meant that almost all upper-caste women survived child labour.\n\nThis was so apparent that when the lower-caste British people migrated to Australia and America, their children were taller than the parents by 2 inches in the immediate generation. Such was the nutritional deficiency the lower-castes faced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The shocking practice of burial clubs where low-caste British women would let their children die purposely so that they could collect insurance money. Infanticide was widespread among the lower castes –\n\nBurial clubs were government-approved legitimate institutions that would allow low-caste British parents to enroll a sick child into their facility. The sick child was then given no food or medical assistance and basically allowed to die out of neglect.\n\nMany British low-caste people would enroll their infants into two or more such “burial clubs” so that they would get twice the insurance money off their child’s death.\n\nThus we can see, infanticide was institutionalized in Britain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven today, British bootlickers who have been given titles like OBE sing songs of the upper-caste British people. Because this was how the upper caste rewarded the bootlicking of the lower caste. They gave the loyal bootlickers titles throughout history. If a bootlicker made the shoe shine with his spit, the man was given a modest estate and the bootlicker was grateful for it for life.\n\nThis culture continues to this day. And the upper-castes are still venerated in Britain.\n\nWhen will Britain throw away the shackles of such an oppressive caste system? They really need to smash this birth-based patriarchal system today. Patriarchal because did you know that women in Britain were only allowed to vote only in 1928. Before that women of only the upper-castes were allowed to vote, and only if they held any property.\n\nIn comparison, women in India never had to fight to cast their vote.\n\nSo much for the harbingers of civility!\n\nThat’s it,\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources – \n\nThe horrors of the life of low caste British people during the Regency period –\n\n[https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/regency-inequality-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-in-georgian-britain/](https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/regency-inequality-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-in-georgian-britain/)\n\nThe different castes during the same period –\n\n[https://reginajeffers.blog/2015/08/19/7889/](https://reginajeffers.blog/2015/08/19/7889/)\n\nThe caste systems during the Georgian Era –\n\n[https://victorian-era.org/georgian-era-facts/society-social-classes.html](https://victorian-era.org/georgian-era-facts/society-social-classes.html)\n\nThe caste system during the Victorian era and the difficulties of women and children during the same time –\n\n[https://victorian-era.org/victorian-era-society.html#Victorian\\_Working\\_class](https://victorian-era.org/victorian-era-society.html#Victorian_Working_class)\n\nChild labour, mortality and pathetic living conditions for the lower castes during Victorian era –\n\n[https://sites.udel.edu/britlitwiki/social-life-in-victorian-england/](https://sites.udel.edu/britlitwiki/social-life-in-victorian-england/)\n\nChemical castration of homosexuals as per the buggery act in Britain –\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT\\_rights\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom)\n\nHow only the upper caste women were allowed to vote until the 1918 –\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s\\_suffrage\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_Kingdom)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 't7rbym'<br />Score:366<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t7rbym/the_land_of_the_original_casteists_a_brief/</li>

China can use all of the arguments that Russia is using to start invasion against us in the North East\n\n1) India already joined QUAD. China sees this as a threat to her security.\n\n2) Suppose West can pull Bangladesh, Nepal into her influence and make them  criticize China. Again an expansion of US interest.\n\n3) Maybe US pushes for tough sanctions against China\n\n4) China can use the card that they have cultural and historical relationship with the North East and Ladakh region.\n\n5) They can also say we are supressing the real voice of the people in North-East.\n\n6) Therefore, China does not have any options other than invasion! They want to remove the fascist forces in Northeast.\n\nWhat, do you think of this? \n\nThe situation is right in front of us. We gotta learn and adapt. Many of the people here are thinking we can become closer to China if US impose secondary sanctions on us. That is a wishful thinking.\n\nChina wants few things from us\n\n1) first North East and Ladakh.\n2) Andaman Islands.\n3) Join CEPC.\n\nThese will be their demands.

Acting by the actors is the best i have ever seen in a movie. You are able to feel their emotions like you were present in that situation. I also like the fact that it counters basically every argument made by people who try to sugar coat or defend the kashmiri pandit genocide. I would recommend you to not take kids with you because this movie has a lot of graphic scenes which show the harsh reality of that situation but you should still watch it because the truth is always harsh but it needs to be known.

      <li>Title::: 'Do you too feel that information warfare on the recent development Ukraine-Russia crisis on the internet, social media and internation news is at its peak?'<br />Body: "Does following the internation news, social media and the entire internet too make you feel like Russia came with all the advanced warfare and Ukrainian soldiers are fighting with stick and bones and yet Ukranians are having an edge over the Russians?\n\nTo be really honest, I think this is the information warfare tactic that we have been hearing all this time and is highly discouraging for Russians. I am not much bothered about what is happening in Europe and Russia but the information warfare tactic that NATO and it's allies that they are using against Russia is worth noting down.\n\nWhat I am asking and am really worried about is that how much harm this information warfare can cause to Indians in future incidents. We saw glimpse of it during Balakot airstrike (by Pakistan and other Islamic state), Galwan Valley incident (by Chinese and Communists) and even during the Farmer Protests (by Western countries especially USA). \n\nBut, I think Russia-Ukraine crisis shows the peak of information warfare and how it can be used to manipulate people all over the world. \n\nConsider a scenario in future where, say, Indian tries to take back PoK, or say when Uniform Civil Code is introduced in India. The information warfare tactic that we witnessed just now could harm us Indians in a similar way what we are witnessing right now, or even worse considering how gullible Indian population is. And it's worth noting down that Indians had internet penetration rate of 61% in 2021.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? Do you think Indians should take steps to prevent ourselves from this information warfare? Do you think we can take steps to educate Indians about the education warfare?"<br />Author: 'pkludakgaya'  id: 't5niwc'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t5niwc/do_you_too_feel_that_information_warfare_on_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: "This is a thread that will explain the implied poor Russian Army truck maintenance practices based on this photo of a Pantsir-S1 wheeled gun-missile system's right rear pair of tires below &amp; the operational implications during the Ukrainian mud season."<br />Body: ' For the sin of being the new guy, I was the DCMA quality auditor in charge of the US Army\'s FMTV "vehicle exercise program" at the contractor manufacturing them from the Mid-1990\'s to the mid-2000\'s Then we got more new guys.  Short form: Military trucks need to be...   turned over and moved once a month for preventative maintenance reasons.  In particular you want to exercise the central tire air inflation system (CTIS) to see if lines have leaks or had insect/vermin nests blocking the system.  One of the biggest reasons for the repositioning, per TACOM logistic Representatives, was that direct sunlight ages truck tires.  The repositioning of Trucks in close parking prevents a lot of this sun rotting and cycling the CTIS keeps the tire sidewalls supple.  When you leave military truck tires in one place for months on end.  The side walls get rotted/brittle such that using low tire pressure setting for any appreciable distance will cause the tires to fail catastrophically via rips.  Now look at the same Pantsir-S1 tire sidewalls after the Ukrainians tried to tow or drive it out of the mud.  The right rear tire fell apart because the rips in it were too big for the CTIS to keep aired up.  No one exercised that vehicle for 1 year  ,  There is a huge operational level implication in this.  If the Russian Army was too corrupt to exercise a Pantsir-S1.  They were too corrupt to exercise the trucks &amp; wheeled AFV\'s now in Ukraine.  The Russians simply cannot risk them off road during the Rasputitsa/Mud season .  And there is photographic evidence of this.  There are 60(+) Russian army trucks crowded &amp; parked on this raised road bed to avoid the fate of the mud-bogged Pantsir-S1.   Given the demonstrated levels of corruption in truck maintenance.  There is no way in h--l that there are enough tires in the Russian army logistical system.    So their wheeled AFV/truck  park is as road bound as Russian Army columns were in the 1st Russo-Finnish War.  What that means is that as long as and where ever the Spring Rasputitsa is happening.  The Russian Army attack front is three wheeled AFV\'s wide.  When the Ukrainians can block the road with ATGM destroyed vehicles. They can move down either side of the road like Fins in 1939 ,  destroying Russian truck columns.  The Crimea is a desert and the South Ukrainian coastal areas are dryer.  So we are not seeing this there.  But elsewhere the Russians have a huge problem for the next 4-to-6 weeks.  A Pantsir is not some cheap throwaway truck. This is a modern anti-air defense system that is of extremely high value. That\'s why OP suspects that the rest of the army is even worse off.  If they treat a Pantsir this way, how well do they maintain their cheaper vehicles?  It\'s especially critical in Russian doctrine, all the way back to Soviet times. Their AF was/is weaker than NATO\'s so they rely on ground platforms like this to protect them from Apaches and A-10s. They don\'t throw away stuff like this on purpose \n\nlink to original thread with images. \n\n[https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1499164245250002944](https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1499164245250002944)'<br />Author: 'amit3125'  id: 't5jqoh'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t5jqoh/this_is_a_thread_that_will_explain_the_implied/</li>

So I am just pasting it here: \n\nIndian nationalist here. While people do know what Russia is doing is wrong, they often ask, where was this energy when pakistan committed genocide on bangladeshi hindus? Or when kashmiri pandits were exiled out of their homelands by islamic separatists through massacres, rapes and torture that goes on till today? \n\n\nInfact, US was on Pakistan's side during the former, and Ukraine has always voted against India maintaining control over kashmir valley (if we didn't, the islamic radicals in that state would have slaughtered all the atheists and polytheists already, or atleast relegated them to living under sharia law as second class citizens). \n\n\nUkraine has also voted against India possessing nukes for her protection. Can you imagine India trying to manage a two front war against Pakistan and China, both armed with nukes, while somehow trying to pull her people out of poverty? We would have been completely at the mercy of a nation whose leadership has repeatedly said that their ultimate goal is to cut up India and reinstate islamic rule here. \n\n\nIf a nation has in the past voted in favour of rendering us powerless and defenceless against our hostile neighbours, then why would we vote in that nation's favour when that nation is the helpless and defenceless one? \n\n\nNATO has been bombing the ever living crap out of the middle east. Where was all this energy then? Is it only reserved for white european nations? Because let's be honest if US was attacked most european nations except UK won't bother to help them out. If that is indeed the case, as it looks to be, then we too will only give a fuck when our own interests are concerned. It takes two to tango, and european nations clearly don't have the slightest bit of empathy for what goes in south asia. If anything, they look at the region with a snobbish condescending eye as if they are a superior civilization. Well, if they are all that, then they shouldn't need our help and support, no? \n\n\nIndia will be no longer taken for granted on international forums. It isn't the naive dumb kid that everybody takes advantage of anymore. You want our help? You better give us the same respect as you would to any major power. Or atleast fucking treat us and our international students with bare minimum dignity. \n\n\nYou can't shit all over somebody ever since their nation was fucking born, and then expect them to help you in times of crisis in return for nothing. And, this is a crisis not just for Ukraine, but for the whole Europe (as is evidenced by how the influential european nations are scrambling about, caught with their pants down). What has europe ever given to India? It has only taken from our lands and defiled our people. We don't even get credit for our *voluntary* contribution to saving europe by sending vast numbers of men and supplies. As a british viceroy (curzon IIRC) had clearly stated, british were a third rate power if you took out their control over the subcontinent. Do you think Britain could have done what it did in WW2 without indian men and material. The latter taken from us forcibly at the expense of putting a whole state of ours in a brutal famine I may add. Who even remembers it? It would be safe to say that even if India did help Ukraine out, her contribution would he completely ignored even by the ukrainians themselves. \n\n\nOtoh Russia has supported us through thick and thin. So, they will be the ones we will support. We are not doing *anything* different from europeans. Just looking out for our  interests first.

So when these people say that what Russia is doing is wrong(I am not gonna get into if it\'s true or not cuz it\'s not what this post is about) then so is the Akhand Bharat concept, so is 1971 war when we broke a sovereign State into 2, so is all those RW people saying to break Pak into 4 more countries to stop terrorism arising from that place, so is taking back POK and Aksai Hind cuz like it or not none of the western countries acknowledge POK or Aksai Hind as part of India or even disputed territory at least(yes I know about the UN resolution which states Pak should vacate all occupying territories but let\'s be real no 3rd country has acknowledged it). So let\'s be a true example of humanity and condemn each of these things which our country did.

You\'re no better than an hatemongrer if you refuse to educate yourself before spreading any opinion. You aren\'t compassionate over anything, its just easier for you to repeat whats fed with the totalitarian control over the media by  NATO allies.\n\nIt\'s really  infuriating how USA/NATO are being seen as some beacon of righteousness  and peace after what they\'ve done in the global south and are continuing  to do in Syria, Somalia, Libya... as we speak. Not to mention, this  condemnation of violence only comes because the Civilians who might  suffer are fairly rich white people.\n\nPutting  aside the fact that Russia patiently tried to play diplomatic foot in  the issue, or the countless times the puppet regime in Ukraine have  threatened russian and its own citizens. Its insane to label this  Russian military operation as anything imperialist or war-mongering. If  Cuba, Bolivia, Iran and others can support Russian intervention in the  region, maybe it is an key fight against NATO imperialism no?\n\nFinally,  before anyone shouts "russian bot" or whatever.

      <li>Title::: 'I will never consider Gandhi “mahatma”'<br />Body: 'In my opinion, we should consider trivializing Gandhi\'s symbolic value because he is not a Mahatma. Despite winning a democratic election in 1936, he ascertained that Shubhash Chandra Bose would not be the president of the INC. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru would be India\'s first Prime Minister, he decided. He clearly killed the internal democracy of the party by neglecting a democratic election.\n\nBecause the British, who controlled the money, were unable to aid him, Mahatma Gandhi set a 5 rupee price on his autograph in order to fund his different activities. Mahatma Gandhi would sleep with nubile teen girls in his final years to prove his chastity and put his libidinous cravings to the test. Gandhi\'s behavior became shameful when he signed with Irwin (see Gandhi Pact 1931) and expelled all of Congress\'s leaders, but he didn\'t even consider three brilliant fighters: Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev.\n\nHe has no right to be on our currency note, or anyone else\'s for that matter, especially as someone who has declared that black Africans are "troublesome, very horrid, and live like animals." The fundamental facts are unmistakable: Gandhi was misogynistic toward black Africans as a young lawyer in South Africa, feeling that they were inferior to Europeans and Indians. He used the disparaging epithet "kaffirs" to describe black Africans.\n\nThe sooner you start, the better. Gandhi was not the only individual who helped us gain our independence. Only having Gandhi on bank notes belittles the contributions of other freedom fighters such as Veer Sawarkar, Sardar Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose, and many others who have made an equal or greater contribution to our country. It\'s past time for us to fix this and treat all national personalities equally. After all, we\'re talking about a man who believed the rich should stay rich and the poor should stay poor and hardly get up by weaving cloths like him.

The  first one is George Kennan, arguably America\'s greatest ever foreign  policy strategist, the architect of the U.S. cold war strategy.

"The barbarians  slew vast numbers of men – civilians, all, in the countryside – forced  vast numbers of our women to sacrifice their lives to Agni to escape  their perverted hands – and the children have been taken as slaves. All  to lure us out of our fortified city. But we held our ground, as you  asked, and your plan was executed."\n\n*In any unforeseen circumstance,* he had said, *Should I be unable to reconvene with the Malava capital, then you shall act as my representative and execute my plan.*\n\n*Yes, Lord,* Princess Pskaradharini had replied simply.\n\nThere  were some scholars, including Chanakya\'s own preceptor Chanaka, who  maintained that only some feelings were valid: those that stemmed from *sattva* (goodness) and *rajas* (greatness) were valid, while those that stemmed from *tamas* (wicked) were invalid. Kindness was always valid; fury never so – ambition was valid so long as it was towards a sattvic goal.\n\n*Neti Kautilyah.*  A feeling was made valid or invalid by the validity or invalidity of  the action that it encouraged in its bearer. To make a country  prosperous, it was necessary to love it – to avoid death, it was  necessary to hate it – and to destroy an enemy, it was necessary to hate  him.\n\n(Such were the depravity of the times, the aged cried, that  vast numbers of civilians, without regard for their caste, wealth or  learning, had been used as negotiating tokens. Such were the depravity  of the times, that even Brahmin women had been left no choice but to  self-immolate to preserve their dignity.)\n\nConversely, generic  depression was not a valid feeling; nor was complaining about the times;  nor was hatred towards a good man; nor was aversion towards the rich  for being miserly; nor was lust for another man\'s wife and wealth.\n\n(He  mustered every spark of hatred, every feeling of revulsion, that he had  ever faced toward anyone – toward the wicked Greeks who had murdered  Pskaradharini, toward Dhanananda and the Magadhan monarchs before him,  toward the Persians – which now felt like such a long time ago – toward  all those who refused to just *shut up and listen to him* –  mustered all the kind emotions he had ever felt – for his mother, for  Professor Chanaka, for his students, for the women who had loved him,  for all those who adored and worshipped him – and cast away the positive  emotions, and directed his hatred against the barbarians led by  Alexander.)\n\nThere would be a time to exchange ideas and to trade  with the Greeks, to entertain them as partners and friends, as  immigrants and as hosts for traders and monks, to hire them as  mercenaries and to compliment their strengths as one customarily did to a  defeated enemy, as Rama had done to Ravana after defeating him. And  then it would no longer be valid to hate them.\n\n"She died bravely,"  said the Consul, the grieving father. "Sword in hand, slaying barbarian  after barbarian until her very last breath."\n\n*There is much that I must disclose to you,* he had said. *After the war.*\n\nThat time was not now.\n\nNow was the time for war.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Those  whose sons and wives are kept (as hostages) shall be made recipients of  salaries from two states and considered as under the mission of  enemies. Purity of character of such persons shall be ascertained  through persons of similar profession.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.12:19\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSuch lies! Such lies, that his enemies propagated – enemies on the inside!\n\nThose who pretend to be friends of Alexander, and yet are jealous of his success.\n\nTo believe that the heroic Alexander – the *demigod* Alexander – the great besieger, who destroyed the mighty empire of the Persians, who defeated the fearsome Assakenoi (*Ashvakayanas*)  in battle, who obtained the submission of Taxila, the most prosperous  city known to the Greeks, who defeated the mighty Porus (*Purushottama*)  with his many elephants and then vanquished those enemies whom Porus  himself was previously unable to defeat – could meet his match in the  hands of a loosely confederated, lionskin-wearing barbarian tribe like  the Sibis and the Oxydraci (*Kshudrakas*) – or indeed, by any mortals at all!\n\nIt can only be attributed to foolishness or malice to claim so.\n\nHere, then, is the truth, as Alexander recounts to Nearchus and other chroniclers who have accompanied him.\n\nAs  the Macedonian army sailed down the Chenab river, I learned that the  kings who ruled by the banks of that river had retreated to strong forts  out of their fear of me. But as much as the son of Zeus is inclined  towards mercy, he took this action as a rejection of his sovereignty –  for all former vassals of the Persian empire were to submit to me, that  had been my command – and so I began to harass the countries of these  enemies to draw them out of their forts.\n\nNearchus says: And this is when, of course, we received news that Nicanor, the Satrap of the Paropamisadae (*Kamboja*) had been slain?\n\nIndeed – this was when we received the communication from Shashigupta, informing us that the Aspaisoi (*Ashvakas*)  rebelled, led by a certain wicked Scythian princess, an Amazon by the  name of Gritachi, interrupting our supplies and murdering our  reinforcements. Nicanor had been slain, and the cowardly Shashigupta,  receiving an ultimatum from Queen Gritachi, had also deserted me – and  even King Ambhi of Taxila woefully informed me that all his forces were  occupied fighting the opportunistic nuisance that were the Abhiras of  Kashmir. It was a trying time indeed!\n\nNearchus says: Is this why  you retreated from attacking the Sibis? Was it here that you realized  that by attacking the Oxydraci directly, you will be able to reconvene  with your territory in Arachosia and Gedrosia \\[1\\] and secure a Southern  supply line to Babylon?\n\nRetreated? Nonsense! I swiftly made  contact with Phillipos, who began campaigning to eliminate the Aspaisoi  menace. Sure, the war certainly made the supply of reinforcements from  the North more expensive, but it was not an impossibility – nothing is,  for the son of Zeus! In view of the objectives of war, I recognized that  the objective of my war against the Sibis was to prevent them from  aiding the Malloi (*Malavas*) further South, who were the enemies of true importance, who ruled over the most prosperous Indian city apart from Taxila.\n\nWhy  didn\'t I secure the Southern supply line? As mentioned, the problems in  the North were not of such great importance that I needed to reorient  the entire purpose of my Indian campaign as its consequence. Should I  bother, in the course of my grand campaign, to weed out every criminal  and miscreant who lives among the barbarians – as are the lion-clad  Sibis of no influence, or the loosely confederated Oxydraci? Or should I  focus on besieging those impenetrable forts, scaling those unscalable  heights, conquering those countries that even my godly half-brother  Dionysus was unable to conquer? Of course, it is the latter course that a  heroic name like mine chooses.\n\n(Alexander had approached the  Kshudrakas with a mighty confidence – with his soldiers and closest  confidantes singing such praises that he had never lost a battle, that  he was invincible, and had such a record to show for it! But on setting  foot on Kshudraka territory, his army had been plagued by such troubles –  poisonous plants, traps, bandits, fires, skirmishing horse-archers –  each village they slaughtered would have, with discipline, poisoned  their food and water making them of no use to the invading army.\n\nThus  forced to treat the peasants with kindness, Alexander was left with no  negotiating chips against the Kshudrakas. At this point, Alexander was  fearful of breaking his streak of victories that his army had so  praised, and desperately wished to abandon the mission against the  Kshudrakas – but was also fearful of causing his army to lose faith in  him, and desperately needed a win.\n\nBut he was also aware – for he  was no stranger to the cautionary Attic tragedies – that desperation  drove men to make impulsive choices, choices that lead to disasters of  such magnitude as to undo the great gains they may have previously made.\n\nAnd  in a move that surprised even Chanakya, as well as himself – for they  had both apparently overestimated Alexander\'s ambitiousness and  perfectionist thoroughness – Alexander declared that the objective of  the campaign against the Kshudrakas had always been to isolate them in  their city while he launched a sudden surprise attack on the Malavas,  his *real* rivals.)\n\nNearchus says: I must say – I had been  confused by your actions against these tribes, but all the pieces truly  came together in your invasion of the Malloi.\n\nIndeed! The Malloi –  the prosperous Malloi with their great city; this time, having learned  the strategy of the Indians and being determined to win – as I always  have … of course – I rushed my cavalry into the Malava country before  word could reach the defenders, surrounded their capital, and rampaged  through the country for a full-scale conquest.\n\nNearchus says: And  one by one, each layer of their defence fell. Taken by surprise, large  parts of their army had been outside the fortress and unprepared, and  they fell to your cavalry. Then your infantry arrived, and surrounded  the city – and then, of course, the elephants that had previously been  seized from Porus.\n\nCareful, now! We did not seize those elephants –  Porus is a friend of mine, and it was in this capacity that he sent his  elephants to serve me. But yes – terrified by the sight of Porus\'s  elephants, the Malloi quit defending their city walls, and retreated to  their citadel, where we pursued them.\n\nNearchus says: And that was where you were wounded – by that stray arrow!\n\nAn  arrow is nothing, Nearchus. There was nothing more heartening to see  than my men charge the walls of the citadel in teutonic fury – both to  pursue the archer who had shot me, and to hunt down the Malloi at large  and massacre them. To know the regard with which my men hold me, even  after all these years – to hear their guttural roars, to see the  devotion in the eyes of even those who had previously mutinied against  me!\n\nNearchus says: But once they entered the citadel—\n\nThey slew the Malloi and enslaved the women.\n\n(They found the citadel almost empty, except for those defenders who had already been slain.)\n\nNearchus says: But—\n\nAnd the children too! Yes, they were also enslaved.\n\n(A clicking sound. And then the entire citadel collapsed onto itself, killing the invading Greeks instantly.)\n\nNearchus says: But actually—\n\nThat\'s all that happened, Nearchus. That is all that happened. It was a great victory for us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*He  shall construct his own residential palace after the model of his  treasury-house; or he may have his residential abode in the centre of  the chamber of illusions, provided with secret passages made into the  walls; or in an underground chamber provided with the figures of  goddesses and of altars (chaitya) carved on the wooden door-frame, and  connected with many underground passages for exit; or in an upper storey  provided with a staircase hidden in a wall, with a passage for exit  made in a hollow pillar, the whole building being so constructed with  mechanical contrivance as to be caused to fall down when necessary.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.20:2\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n"Today, Chandragupta, your education is complete. Only rituals remain – chief among them being *guru dakshina* (tuition fee payment). But for the education I have given you, your fee will not be monetary."\n\nChandragupta kneeled.

      <li>Title::: "India is on the wrong side of this conflict and it's going to cost them in the future"<br />Body: "I'm sure this going to garner a lot of downvotes, but India is backing the wrong horse, implicitly or explicitly.  Either way, they've made a poor calculation in abstaining from supporting Ukraine, and to a certain extent by not just outright supporting Russia as well.  \n\nNobody is saying we should ignore the role Ukraine has played in conflicts between India and its neighbors, and how the Russians did come to India's aid during said conflicts, but we also need to look at this from a long term perspective if India wants to be taken seriously as a world power and not continue to run second-fiddle to countries like China.  \n\nRight now, nuclear weapons are currently on the table.  I have a sinking feeling we're going to potentially see them in use during this conflict unfortunately given how unhinged Putin has become, and if and when that happens, India will have to bear some of the guilt.  Right now, China still has a great deal of backchannel influence over this situation and can effectively block everyone else out.  The thing is, India could have had a seat at this table given their defense expenditures for Russian military hardware, and because they've always been more or less aligned as trading partners.  However, it should be clear that India in fact won't have a seat at any table, because it's decided to take itself out of any conversation entirely.  This is just another poor decision in India's long-standing tradition of making poor decisions on a global and economic scale.  \n\nLet's look at this from a military standpoint.  Why are you buying outdated hardware from a dying country who's innovation and economy are in the toilet?  Rather than a Sukhoi Mk-30, get a F-35 JSF or Saab Gripen.  Indigenous aircraft is great, but lean on other countries with advanced avionics to bolster in-country development as well.  The Russians don't have that expertise anymore.  Hell just look at the hardware they're sending into the Ukraine right now.  \n\nWhy are you aligning yourself with a country who's GDP is less than the valuations of most fortune 50 companies?  There are other places to get energy from  that aren't run by a proto-fascist dictator.  \n\nIf you think that not being a part of this conflict on either side is somehow helping India not be a pawn in anyone's conflict, you're sadly mistake.  India is already a pawn.  It's a lonely chess piece on a bigger board and for all the noise it tries to make, it's never taken seriously.  Why? Because it's dug itself into a hole economically by not putting enough money into its own infrastructure to attract foreign investment, and has not done enough to clean up its own image internally for citizens to believe in building a better country.  It's a shame given the populace and potential man-power to take over both as a regional and global power.\n\nWhile it's absolutely shameful the display of racism and prejudice we're seeing at the border of Ukraine and Poland with Indians and south asians being denied safe passage and movement, make no mistake that when the bombs begin falling on these parts of Ukraine, Russia won't care who's caught in the crossfire.  Russia is also a vehemently racist country as well, with little regard for the lives of their own, let alone for those they consider racially inferior.  \n\nIndia could use this as a bargaining chip for greater leverage in geo-political affairs and sway others towards itself and helping realize its own international goals, but they're not doing themselves any favors right now by taking the stance, or lack thereof, they have now.  \n\nLet's say India outwardly comes out and supports Russia - maybe they could be utilized in negotiations to get Putin to stand down or to broker a ceasefire agreement.  Maybe they could leverage their arms and energy agreements as a means of getting them to retreat or at the very least engaging in talks with Zelensky.  Hell, even Switzerland - a known hub for money laundering and helping all sorts of unsavory people hiding their money is no longer neutral.  \n\nThis isn't about appealing to white westerners.  Quite the opposite.  It's going to be hard to justify a non-stance if a nuke is detonated and millions die.  It's going to be hard to wipe the blood off your hands if you don't do anything to try and stop them."<br />Author: 'uncledoobie'  id: 't4cwaq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t4cwaq/india_is_on_the_wrong_side_of_this_conflict_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Regarding the post/video claiming that Indian student was killed in the bombing of central square of Kharkiv...'<br />Body: 'Disclaimer- I am neither supporting or opposing any side in the Russian Invasion of Ukraine but i wanted to post this since i believe that we are straying a bit from objectivity and rationality (as well as neutrality) in our discussions in this group and getting too emotional due to recent developments regarding death of an Indian student from Karnataka in Kharkiv, Ukraine.  \n\n\nThere has been conflicting reports on the nature of death of Naveen (Indian National killed today). News reports say the student was killed in a shooting, not in the bombing. Here\'s a excerpt from Indian Express:\n\n"The Indian student has been identified as Naveen Shekharappa Gyanagoudar, 20, from Karnataka. He was a fourth-year medical student at the Kharkiv National Medical University. “Naveen was shot dead around 10.30 am Ukrainian time today. He was standing in the queue before a grocery shop when the Russian army fired at people. We have no information about his body. None of us was able to visit the hospital, probably where it is kept now,” said Sridharan Gopalakrishnan, who was Naveen’s hostel mate."\n\nHis hostel roommate himself says that Naveen was shot dead, though his father, who is in Karnataka, says he was killed in a bombing.\n\nAbout people blaming Russia in the comments- as sad as the students death is, he wasn\'t targeted by the Russians. The two countries are engaged in a war, nobody can fully control the nature of casualties - you avoid being a victim of collateral damage by NOT BEING AT A PUBLIC PLACE IN A BORDER TOWN THAT\'S LIKELY TO BE HIT FIRST DURING WAR. Ukraine has been arming civilians with guns and javelins since the invasion. Civilians have also been throwing molotov cocktails at Russian vehicles and army, from the streets, from the windows of their residences. So i am not surprised that the Russians started shooting at people as well. On top of that, the border town is a mere distance of 40 kms from the border. There were trains evacuating people from these areas even in the last days prior to invasion. I am not blaming the victim here, but he shouldn\'t have stayed in the border town when there were so many warnings about the impending war and repeated advisories from Indian govt. and MEA to flee to the Polish/Hungarian/Romanian border. Many students had to traverse more than 3000 kilometers to get to the Polish border.\n\nAlso, i really think Ukraine is making things difficult for Indian students from getting help and being rescued to central or western Ukraine. Around 22nd-23rd of February, students in Kharkiv did not want to leave Ukraine because the universities were neither shutting down classes nor holding them online, making their offline presence necessary and they were essentially stuck there till the war started. Here is a source: [https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/students-caught-up-in-ukraine-due-to-compulsory-classes-by-kharkiv-varsity-373256](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/students-caught-up-in-ukraine-due-to-compulsory-classes-by-kharkiv-varsity-373256)\n\n Also , there must be diplomatic tensions between India and Ukraine due to India\'s repeated abstention from voting in UNSC. Perhaps to ease this tension, India has decided to send medical aid to Ukraine. If the mistreatment of Indian students at the Polish border wasn\'t proof enough of the tensions, here is a student, Shivani Madiwalar from the Kharkiv National Medical University, speaking to The New Indian Express, “Saturday afternoon Israel bus came and evacuated its students from the war-hit city.... When we called the Indian embassy in Ukraine, they cut the phone call when asked about evacuation. From Sunday morning calls are not connecting”. Source: [https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/feb/27/no-aid-from-indian-authorities-in-kharkiv-indian-students-in-trouble-as-russia-occupies-the-city-2424425.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/feb/27/no-aid-from-indian-authorities-in-kharkiv-indian-students-in-trouble-as-russia-occupies-the-city-2424425.html)\n\nI am just a spectator to this crisis and i have only as much info as i read from articles and though i believe we should stick to objectivity and refrain from speculation, i refuse to believe that MEA would just abandon these students stuck at Kharkiv. I don\'t believe it that MEA, willingly, wouldn\'t attempt to evacuate the students. There must be a lot of real hinderances preventing the evacuation of Indian students at Kharkiv, which should\'ve been started even before the invasion began. Perhaps Ukraine thought that the presence of foreign nationals in their universities in these border cities will prevent Russia from attacking them, to avoid deaths of foreign tourists and students and didn\'t allow them to leave.'<br />Author: 'DaChonkIsHere'  id: 't47091'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t47091/regarding_the_postvideo_claiming_that_indian/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Significance of Mahashivratri: The Great Night of Shiva'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Happy Mahashivratri!](https://preview.redd.it/kntjh8h0hrk81.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdff0b4f06041418e98ad934b17ac9352847bd36)\n\n Mahashivratri, “The Great Night of Shiva” is the most significant event in India’s spiritual calendar. The fourteenth day of every lunar month or the day before the new moon is known as Shivratri. Among all the twelve Shivratris that occur in a calendar year, Mahashivratri, the one that occurs in February-March is of the most spiritual significance.\n\nOn this night, the northern hemisphere of the planet is positioned in such a way that there is a natural upsurge of energy in a human being. This is a day when nature is pushing one towards one’s spiritual peak.\n\nIt is to make use of this, that in this tradition, we established a certain festival which is nightlong. To allow this natural upsurge of energies to find their way,one of the fundamentals of this nightlong festival is to ensure that you remain awake with your spine vertical throughout the night.\n\nMahashivratri is very significant for people who are on the spiritual path. It is also very significant for people who are in family situations, and also for the ambitious in the world. People who live in family situations observe Mahashivratri as Shiva’s wedding anniversary. Those with worldly ambitions see that day as the day Shiva conquered all his enemies.\n\nBut, for the ascetics, it is the day he became one with Mount Kailash. He became like a mountain – absolutely still. In the yogic tradition, Shiva is not worshipped as a God, but considered as the Adi Guru, the first Guru from whom the science of Yoga originated. After many millennia in meditation, one day he became absolutely still. That day is Mahashivratri. All movement in him stopped and he became utterly still, so ascetics see Mahashivratri as the night of stillness.\n\nShivratri, is the darkest day of the month. Celebrating Shivratri on a monthly basis, and the particular day, Mahashivratri, almost seems like celebration of darkness. Any logical mind would resist darkness and naturally opt for light. But the word “Shiva” literally means “that which is not.” “That which is,” is existence and creation. “That which is not” is Shiva. “That which is not” means, if you open your eyes and look around, if your vision is for small things, you will see lots of creation. If your vision is really looking for big things, you will see the biggest presence in the existence is a vast emptiness.\n\nHope You like this post. Btw Happy Mahashivratri to all of you!

      <li>Title::: 'US Govt shuts down China-focused anti-espionage program. After collaboration on Wuhan Lab, another sign of increasing security alliance between US and China. Return of G2 maxim as desired global order, first touted by Obama regime'<br />Body: 'https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/doj-shuts-down-china-focused-anti-espionage-program-00011065\n\n\nThe Group of Two (G-2 or G2) is a proposed informal special relationship between the People\'s Republic of China and the United States of America. Originally initiated in 2005 by C. Fred Bergsten as primarily an economic relationship, it began to gain wider currency and scope from foreign policy experts as a term recognizing the centrality of the Sino-American relations near the beginning of the Obama Administration. Prominent advocates include former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, historian Niall Ferguson, former World Bank President Robert Zoellick and former chief economist Justin Yifu Lin.\n\nAs two of the most influential and powerful countries in the world, there have been increasingly strong suggestions within American political circles of creating a G-2 relationship where the United States and China would work out solutions to global problems together,\n\nThe concept of a G-2 was first raised by noted economist C. Fred Bergsten in 2005.[2] In 2009, Bergsten made the following arguments for such a relationship:\n\nChina will shortly pass Japan to become the world\'s second largest economy behind the United States; the two together accounted for almost one half of all global growth during the four-year boom prior to the crisis; they are the two largest economies; they are the two largest trading nations; they are the two largest polluters; they are on opposite ends of the world\'s largest trade and financial imbalance: the United States is the largest deficit and debtor country while China is the largest surplus country and holder of dollar reserves; and they are the leaders of the two groups, the high-income industrialized countries and the emerging markets/developing nations, that each now account for about one half of global output.[3] Zbigniew Brzezinski had been a vocal advocate for the concept. He publicly advanced the notion in Beijing in January 2009 as the two countries celebrated the 30th anniversary of establishing formal diplomatic ties.[4] He views the informal G-2 as helpful in finding solutions to the global financial crisis, climate change (see Politics of global warming), North Korea\'s nuclear program, Iran\'s nuclear program, the Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, United Nations peacekeeping, nuclear proliferation, and nuclear disarmament. He called the principle of "harmony" a "mission worthy of the two countries with the most extraordinary potential for shaping our collective future".[5][6]\n\nHistorian Niall Ferguson has also advocated the G-2 concept. He coined the term Chimerica to describe the symbiotic nature of the U.S.-China economic relationship.\n\nRobert Zoellick, former president of the World Bank, and Justin Yifu Lin, the Bank\'s former chief economist and senior vice president, have stated that the G-2 is crucial for economic recovery and that the U.S. and China must work together. They state that "without a strong G-2, the G-20 will disappoint".[7]\n\nWhile widely discussed, the concept of a G-2 has not been fully defined. According to Brzezinski, G-2 described the current realities, while for former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, a G-2 could emerge in the foreseeable future.[4] Miliband proposes EU integration as a means to create a potential G-3 that consists of the United States, China and the European Union.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been very supportive of good relations between the two countries and more cooperation on more issues more often. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has stated that U.S.–China relationship should be "taken to a new level".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Two'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 't457n2'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t457n2/us_govt_shuts_down_chinafocused_antiespionage/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Russia-Ukraine Conflict: New developments, propaganda, and India's role"<br />Body: '**About me:** I have lived in both Ukraine and Russia (not for studies) and have been a geopolitical analyst. I have many close friends in both countries and I speak fluent Russian and some Ukrainian.\n\n**Why I am writing this post?** This is a follow-up to my previous post - **if you haven\'t already, go read it to get an exhaustive background of the conflict: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t11znd/on_ukraine_and_russia_as_someone_who_has_lived_in/** It is critical to get a better sense on the developments since then. \n\n#Developments in Ukraine:\n\n- I highlighted this in earlier post and comments there as well but **Ukraine has been ten-steps ahead of Russia in terms of propaganda** and imagery and **has been highly successful in achieving most of its diplomatic goals within a short time**. This stems from the fact that most of the people find Ukraine as the underdog, find an invasion immoral, find the reasons of the invasion even more immoral and unclear, and the image management by Ukraine and its Western allies has been second to none.\n\n- Russia has been successfully cut off from the SWIFT - which is the nuclear-bomb equivalent in financial world - and is facing economic sanctions that are unprecedented.  I elaborated in a comment about **Zelensky\'s exceptional image-building skills** in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t11znd/on_ukraine_and_russia_as_someone_who_has_lived_in/hyh23ad/). \n\n- Ukraine has successfully leveraged this situation to its favor and **has applied for EU membership and fast-tracking it.** Chances of that happening are quite slim - Ukraine has been a highly corrupt country with tons of issues with bureaucracy and rule of law, but the timing allows them to have a special focus surely. Nonetheless, countries in Eastern-Europe, particularly Poland, are vetting this knowingly. This aligns with [geopolitics of Poland as well as covered in my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t11znd/on_ukraine_and_russia_as_someone_who_has_lived_in/)\n\n- **Ukraine continues to win on diplomatic fronts** and is receiving millions of dollars in funding, weapons, and is about to issue War Bonds.\n\n#Propaganda: (strongly suggest to read)\n\n- **I am going to focus here on sharing Ukrainian/Western propaganda for two reasons:** a) because Russia is known for propaganda so much that de-facto, most of their content is anyhow propaganda. b) Which leads many to believe that Western/Ukrainian content must be true because the other side is known as the poster-child of propaganda. Untrue. Western-backed propaganda is far more subtle and in **this conflict has been exemplary in generating worldwide support and sympathy. This is one of the few conflicts where people can see developments in real-time (streaming via Insta/Tiktok and access to mobile phones), this leading them to believe that this cannot be manipulated. Turns out, it is even easier to do that**.\n\n- Key examples of this are: \n\n- You most likely must have come across a heroic **"[Ghost of Kyiv](https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497834538843660291)"** (a Mig-29 fighter pilot from Ukraine who\'d shot 6 Russian planes) - which was massively shared on worldwide media and **[turned out to be fake](https://i.redd.it/2qhv2qrmsak81.png)**. \n\n- **[Ukrainian diplomat reading a message from a soldier to his mom at the United Nations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/mar/01/ukraines-un-ambassador-reads-texts-from-russian-soldier-to-mother-before-he-was-killed-video)** except that it was **[taken from 2ch](https://preview.redd.it/dg3n1atp4mk81.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2becdf66afb8098205efb4ffce9bef9ff3576275)** - a Russian forum (equivalent to taking a post on shitposting subreddit at face value). \n\n- **[Snake Island incident of 13 brave souls who defended a small Island, told Russian ship to "go fuck yourself" before being heroically martyred?](https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1497052056376553479)** This was a turning point for many that garnered a lot of sympathy. [Turns out they are all alive](https://nypost.com/2022/02/28/snake-island-ukrainian-guards-captured-by-russia-still-alive/) and being kept as Prisoners of War under Russian custody.\n\n- **[Images of Zelenskyy in combat dress](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10559103/Russia-Ukraine-war-Viral-photo-Ukrainian-President-Volodymyr-Zelenskyy-actually-YEAR-old.html)** being celebrated as a "leader" that you most likely have seen? They they were **taken in December** (during a meet with troops, ps: sorry for using Dailymail link). \n\n- **[And many viral videos and images](https://www.bbc.com/news/60528276)** of a Russian missile hitting school, Ukrainians destroying Russian tanks, and so on - you must have come across most of them and they turned out to be fake, including, [Ministry of Defence](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1497170325162934272) of Ukraine using a [video game footage](https://www.bbc.com/news/60528276) for Russian warplanes.\n\n- On top of all that, **Western-backed media and politicians tried to whitewash something like Azov Battalion - which is notoriously racist and far-right**! ([European Media](https://twitter.com/oulosP/status/1498229150087266312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1498229150087266312%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FCombatFootage%2Fcomments%2Ft43ghx%2Frussian_ka52_alligators_approaching_the_azov%2F), [New York Times calling them "merely fighting for their country"](https://v.redd.it/k2ck7c6bslk81)) Multiple Human Rights commissions and Amnesty have explicitly **raised concerns about Azov Battalion and rise of far-right in Ukraine.** President Zelenskyy, knowingly turns this into "How can my country have neo-Nazis when it has a Jewish President" -- this argument reeks of *"how could the Blacks in the US have issues and face systematic racism given a Black person (Obama) became President?"*.\n\n- **[Ukrainian armed forces using kindergartens and schools as covers](https://preview.redd.it/5qea6592uqk81.jpg?width=653&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6e68f3abdf3eb184cc489d9ee45ba12f0940661)** and then blaming Russia for shelling schools and residential areas.\n\n- Importantly, above examples are aimed at **not vindicating a particular side** but to highlight that **the first casualty of War is Truth** - and to cross-check before believing something.\n\n#Developments in Russia:\n\n- **Whatever objectives Russia may have had for the conflict, even if they achieve it, it\'s going to end in pyrrhic victory.** Economic sanctions and geopolitical push is brewing dissent internally in Russia and many people - who would have been on the fence about invasion of Ukraine - having seen images on social media, are now furious. **Sanctions effect is going to be extremely detrimental to Russian economy with no revival for next 3-5 years.**\n\n\n- **Russia is aiming for a pincer strategic movement in Ukrainian warfare:** **Here is the [Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine.svg/1920px-2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine.svg.png)** - Ukraine is neatly divided across the Dnieper River and Russia strategy could be to cover them 3-fold: From North (Kyiv) - directly aiming government institutions and toppling central command; From North-East (Kharkiv and Donetsk/Lugansk) to gain stronghold on traditionally-held separatist territories in Donbass; and South (Crimea - Kherson, Mariupol). This implies covering encircling Ukrainian army in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n- **My outlook is that Russia is going to ditch the optics of "peace-keeping" in the coming time and are going to go aggressive:** Russians had mistakenly presumed that: a) A lot of local residents would be highly receptive to them - this could have been true to a degree 8 years back but not now. and b) Ukrainian propaganda/image machine is working extraordinarily well. Additionally, they are being provided top-notch armaments and drones thus proving difficulty for Russian forces. You would find very limited military footage from Russian side but the equation may change.\n\n- **Personal take:** Lastly, I find it very unfortunate that many people and even tech-companies are now cancelling contracts with a usual Russian company, banning hiring of Russians, and firing them. This reeks of **excessively prejudiced and careless attitude**, and arguably xenophobic approach, that will further antagonize geenral population in Russia against the West in long term.\n\n \n\n#India\'s role in the conflict:\n\nIMO, India should:\n\n- **Keep being neutral:** There is immense US-pressure to choose a side following typical strategy of *"If you are not with us, you are against us".* For India, it is best to remain neutral to ensure strong Western ties while keeping in close partnership with Russia. India may, if it plays smart, engage in few public statements for optics (refusing to fund Russia/Purchase something publically) while keeping a back-channel.\n\n- **Russia has been the most critical military ally for India** and has been the biggest military supplier for India.  US/West hope to contain Russia: key strategic aim is to have its buffer states leave its Sphere of Influence (Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan), and ultimately regime change and disintegration of Russia. My strong personal opinion is that this is a foolhardy thought - world\'s largest country with largest nuclear stockpile disintegrating is going to leave an unprecedented crisis. \n\n- **Given decimation of Russian economy, India should tap into extracting as much Russian resources as it can for next 3 to 5 years**. Russia may become an economic pariah for the next few years and will have to turn to other neutral countries: China and India (along with Arab states) are the only countries with potential markets it can turn to. India should leverage this by getting Russian military technology, and natural resources for cheap to fuel its own GDP. Win-Win as India gets to play a strong Russian ally while being neutral politically; benefits from getting Russian resources for cheap; and maintains strong ties to avoid a unipolar world.\n\n_________\n\n\n**Like this post?:** Upvote, award, share and spread the word:)\n\n**Got questions?** Ask away!'<br />Author: 'Vibgyor_5'  id: 't44x3n'<br />Score:425<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t44x3n/russiaukraine_conflict_new_developments/</li>

Yet, I do not see any reports of wrongdoings. Why is that? Only a handful of sites report such things, sites that are not well known. Why do we not fact-check first? It's the first rule of informational hygene.\n\nSo first of all, the BBC has since covered this topic. \n\nSecondly, basically every news site in India is covering this topic. I remember when the first videos came out people dismissed it because they had never heard of the Deccan Herald so it must be a Russian propaganda site. Just because you have never heard of Indian news sites doesn't mean they're all untrustworthy.\n\n&gt; - Video quality is like from 2000 - is it specifically made to avoid capturing any details? Who, having filmed something in 2022 would have such crappy quality?\n\nWas likely sent over WhatsApp resulting in video compression\n\n&gt; On the background you can hear *Russian* language, not *Ukrainian*. And it's important, because in western Ukraine (you know, where Poland is), no one speaks Russian, and only Ukrainian. Secondly, because of a lot of russian diversants (soldiers) trying to sabotage from inside, the President has ordered army/police/etc. to talk only in Ukrainian.\n\nI don't have knowledge of Russian or Ukranian so cannot really confirm or deny this one, would appreciate if someone else who does know the languages could\n\n&gt; Quality again horrible (like on purpose). But if you look at the snippet of the car's licence plate (attached), it's not Ukrainian.

It had earlier issued a genocide alert for Assam and Indian held Kashmir.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Responding to ground realities manifested in the declarations of hate-laden violence from Dharam Sansads, or Hindu Religious Parliaments, served as the background of the January 9, 2022 leadership briefing organized by Justice For All, anti-genocide human rights organization, said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was attended by four hundred community and interfaith leaders from around the United States, Canada and other countries. Justice For All asked for and endorsed the genocide emergency alert announced by the leading watchdog Genocide Watch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nadine Maenza, Chairperson of the bi-partisan United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said, “India has a beautiful history of pluralism... but with the BJP leading the government since 2014, we have seen it erode secular principles by aggressively advocating for a pure Hindu state”. Referring to the recent Hindu religious parliament as “beyond troubling”, she further said, “The US Congress must raise religious freedom concerns in US-India bilateral relationships."  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Prof Stanton, founder of Genocide Watch, and developer of the 10 Stages of Genocide, reminded the audience that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “political base is the base that is held by the RSS… ”, and that the RSS is “filled with hate ever since it was founded, it is basically a Nazi organization, and in fact admired Hitler”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stating that India has been taken over by an extremist party, he disclosed that his research organization believes that India is at Stage 8 of genocide, Persecution, just one step away from conducting extermination, and warned that Modi “will be very happy to just watch it happen”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reiterating an appreciation of India’s culture, Imam Abdul Malik Mujahid, CEO of Justice For All said that the “well-being of Indias’ pluralism and democracy is good for the whole world. So it is in the interest of the world to work together to save India from fascism.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Director of Save India From Fascism project, Zahir Adil, implored the silent majority, Hindu friends and allies, “Muslims have fought and condemned extremists from our faith, it\'s your turn, fight yours!” he stated. At the briefing, Justice For All released a plan for all interested in preventing genocide in India. Actions can be taken at an individual level as well as for mosques and churches, it was suggested.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Justice For All is an international human rights organization with Consultative Status at the United Nations.\n\n[https://www.counterview.net/2022/01/india-reaches-8th-of-10-stage-genocide.html](https://www.counterview.net/2022/01/india-reaches-8th-of-10-stage-genocide.html)'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 't43ai3'<br />Score:99<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t43ai3/us_govt_org_uscirf_ties_up_with_islamist_activism/</li>

But as is visible from last few days a PR campaign is being run on social media platforms (i may be assuming incorrectly). Same is used to bring people in support of Ukraine and the governments have followed the public opinion and started helping Ukraine in the form of weapons and funding. \n\nAll this truly brings forward the power of social media.

On entering this pact any country that is part of this pact will have Chinese nuclear missiles, Chinese military bases and Chinese personnel. This pact says that if one of the countries are attacked, all must join in the invasion of the \'aggressor\' nation. Initial criticism and concerns of this pact by Indian officials is put down by Chinese officials stating \'it is a purely defensive pact\'. Soon, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and ASEAN join this pact.\n\nAPTO missiles and bases surround India. But then, APTO decides to incorporate India\'s largest neighbour, Pakistan. How do you think India\'s reaction will be? Can you think that if Pakistan joints this APTO, it could unconditionally declare war on India to take Kashmir which it considers its own territory. If India declares war on Pakistan, the APTO defence pact will be invoked and all of Asia-Pacific will join a war against India. What would India do? The clear and only rational path would be to invade Pakistan before it joins APTO and create a buffer state perhaps; even at the cost of possible nuclear strikes, economic damage. Imagine PLA bases, artillery, nuclear missiles in Pakistan. During this invasion, imagine the international press calling Pakistan a beacon of democracy and the situation of the Hindus in Pakistan will be washed away. I mean, the latter, the Western media already does.\n\nFortunately, APTO does not exist, yet. But replace India with Russia, and China with the US and an organisation definitely exists, and its called NATO. The country of Pakistan is Ukraine, Russia\'s largest neighbour.

After 70 years of arming and supporting Pakistan, the West really wants to ask this question? You just looked the other way on China and Covid. You looked away as Chinese troops brutally attacked India in the middle of a pandemic. And you just left a huge cache of weapons, even attack helicopters and transports for the Taliban in Afghanistan. The smaller of those weapons have already made it into the hands of terrorists in Kashmir.\n\nAnd now you dare ask what we are doing for your security?\n\nThen why is the West so desperate to have us on their side? Here is one possibility. They are not seeking our help. They are just trying to demonize us.\n\nThey understand India’s interests and compulsions perfectly. They know that New Delhi will not toe their line, and India will not condemn Russia. \n\nThey are manufacturing an excuse for themselves to stay out in case of Chinese aggression against India.\n\nIf something were to happen between China and India tomorrow, the West would like to stay out. Of course they would. While placing sanctions on Russia, they couldn’t even bring themselves to give up the chance to sell expensive watches and jackets to Russian oligarchs. You think they would be willing to give up trillions of dollars of trade, and their entire supply chains, to make a point against China and in support of India? Ha!\n\nBut nevertheless, it would be a bad look for the West. The supposedly democratic West siding with the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship against a democratic India.\n\nHow to get out of this tangle? The answer is obvious. Demonize India on all fronts.'<br />Author: 'alexaxl'  id: 't3i9k0'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t3i9k0/west_does_not_want_indias_help_just_a_public_pr/</li>

It's strange because when I look through their comment history they have normal comments and discussions in other subreddits but here they post all kinds of nasty stuff. This is because of India's neutrality regarding the conflict and they can't comprehend the fact that India is not a western client state and has it's own interests to look after. These people also defend the videos of Indian students getting beaten then wonder why they are getting no sympathy from Indians. Really strange. \n\nWestern countries always put their interests above all else, why can't India?"<br />Author: 'MyyyLegacyyy'  id: 't33j1k'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t33j1k/westerners_in_this_subreddit/</li>

After shitting so much in Yemen, Syria, other middle eastern countries and promoting terrorism in the name of democracy, these people still have the audasity to say that we are against humanity. The same country which is banning African and international student, beating our student just because our politician didn\'t vote for them. \n\nDude we didn\'t even vote for Russia. We bloody abstained.\n\nWe all can already see the hate against Russia, China and India on many other subreddits (mainly Russia right now) just because we didn\'t vote for THEM. "THEM" who are racist against us, shame us, promote terrorism against us. *Bhai pagal samjha hai kya hume?*\n\nPeople who didn\'t give a shit about Justin T. literally impossing an emergency, Queen (who has our vision stone on her khopda) son being a sex offender and still got out are running full on hate against Russia and us. That Ukrainian guy in UNSC not even ashamed of giving threats to innocent kids in front of the whole world. But still we are the coward one in the game.\n\nSecond thing I have noticed is that only USA, Canada and those "colonization was good bro" countries in Europe are the ones protesting. Populous coutries like China, India, majority of Asia and those Middle East and African countries don\'t even care. I am sure other than few, most of our polulation only knows theres a war going on, but they aren\'t bothered. And why should we even bother. Ukraine is the mistake of the west (as always). The West baised media would never show this. After watching their news one will say that the whole world is protesting against Russia. Meanwhile China and India who just dont support them have like 2.8 billion people, already outnumbering them.\n\nI dont know why and why? does Ukraine officials think that if 14/15 countries vote for them then Russia will be like "*abb no war* ". Even if we had voted in favour of them Russia would have still invaded. So instead of asking UNSC  votes from us better question your abandonment by the EU and UN and the one who thinks of himself as god but is "*ram rahim*" in real life, USA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast but not the least its a pleasure to announce that Russians have entered the group Indian and Chinese were in for as far as I can remember.
