      <li>Title::: 'Identity crisis in Indians when they come to live abroad.'<br />Body: "After coming to Europe I've met people from a lot of nationalities and I actively tried to understand their culture and history. Almost all of them are proud of their culture, their customs, and even religion. Indians on the other hand go out of their way to distance themselves from their identity. Hence they lose grounding, start seeking external validation and, become people-pleasers.\n\n300 years of Mughal imperialism, 200 years of British colonialism, and 70 years of systemic erosion of the Indian identity post-independence. When you don't know your history you become a pleaser and start to seek external validation. I have Indian friends who drool when they get attention from white people. In public spaces, they avoid eye-contact, let alone talk to other Indians around. They regularly mock India, our leaders, and reinforce the Western stereotype than India is nothing more than a poor country full of slums and beggars. Indians are known for being open and accommodating and we should be proud of that. But at the same time, we must be grounded and learn about our past. Read books and listen to lectures. Our culture and history is as rich as it could get. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you are on the political left or right, never forget that we are the inheritors of a glorious civilization that was attacked multiple times over millennia but we never succumbed.

In the demo, you have Maa Durga and Lord Vishnu narrating the tale, while Raji gets Maa Durga's trishul as a weapon.\n\nI really loved the combat mechanics, as the Trishul can be used both as an ranged and melee and there a lot of ways in which you can take on the demons.

How one can get spiritual benefit from the sacrifices ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kṛṣṇa consciousness)."\n\n"When one\'s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.33, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql5l97prwgs51.jpg?width=333&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36c924cca738973e54493482d3933ba0479a3a24\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

At around the same time, India was trying to get Cryogenic Engines from Russia. The value of the deal? $250 million. \n\nThese engines were crucial for Indian Space program. especially to graduate from the PSLVs to GSLVs.  President Bush was OK with it. But a democrat senator put in an amendment which stated that IF Russia sold the cryogenic engine to India, this aid package would be scuttled! \n\nRussia badly needed this aid. It had no choice but to back down from the deal it already had with India.  In the same period, China was taking technology from Russia by the bushels. The US, indeed this Senator, of course preferred to look the other way. \n\nNot just that, there were numerous attempts of Sabotage of the Indian cryogenic program by some 'interested' foreign agencies. It took years, but India developed its own solution, lynchpining on the little help it had gotten from Russia before the deal was scuttled. \n\nThe senator that scuttled the deal was one JOE BIDEN.

I've barely ever come across an Indian who doesn't call it yog'a' and it's just funny and absurd to me how, going to the roots of the word, it should be pronounced yog.

Like, the Britishers came, uprooted our entire culture and our pride in it and since then it's been a foray from a hoard of people who have done nothing but widened the gap we've had in our own culture and beliefs. It has come to the point where, slowly, Westerners are becoming more proficient in our culture than us lol. Don't get me wrong, I'm v happy that it's spreading and I do not, by any yardstick, overall the bullshit our ideologies often carry too, but this country has been turned into a boiling pot of religion based politics where everyone just wants to do some bs but not honestly, with dedication and heart, uplift this country and it's citizens. It also needs to come from the citizens itself, too. Anyway, it's just disheartening to see when so many of us are in the blind about things which have always been part of us.

Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bhāgavatam says: dharmaṁ hi sākṣād-bhagavat-praṇītam-the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is called a bona fide spiritual master ?

Her family did not approve of this and beat him to death. 5 people were arrested, 3 of whom were minors. The two adults arrested were Manwar Hussain and Abdul Mahar. \n\nHowever, new information has come up suggesting that the girl (whose identity has been hidden for her protection) was aware of this plan by her family and that her maternal uncle\'s son (her cousin) masterminded it. She had called for help earlier on this matter multiple times, which, all of those fell to deaf ears by the authorities.\n\nShe also claimed that the Delhi Police has put pressure on her to change the statement. She is calling for a CBI probe into the matter to prevent another Hathras-like situation.\n\n&gt; The girl in question interacted with India Today on the condition of anonymity. She said, "It should not be the same condition as Hathras. I want CBI inquiry. Rahul should get justice."\n\n&gt; Making a scathing allegation against the Delhi Police, the girl said, "Adarsh Nagar Police Station put pressure to change the statement. The son of a maternal uncle is the mastermind. I screamed many times for help but no one came forward."\n\n&gt; During the course of the investigation, Delhi Police have combed through CCTV footage from the scene of the crime. The retrieved footage shows a boy wearing a pink colour shirt identified as Rahul Rajput. He can be seen with a girl who is the sole witness in the case. This is the same girl who Rahul befriended prior to his death.\n\n&gt; After watching the CCTV footage concerned, one can speculate that the accused asked the girl to call Rahul Rajput and started thrashing him not far from his home on Nanda Road in Delhi\'s Adarsh Nagar area.\n\n&gt; Rahul Rajput\'s mother has alleged that the Delhi Police were unwilling to register a case at first. Officers said there were no visible injuries on his body, claimed the mother.\n\n&gt; In addition, Rahul Rajput\'s uncle claimed that the family did not know those who assaulted the boy on Wednesday.

      <li>Title::: 'Hathras incident: My observation so far. [Serious]'<br />Body: 'As per how events are unfolding, there\'s definitely some thing going on. I watched couple of videos on social media interviewing people of the same village (It may be wrong but let\'s assume they are true for a moment), all of them said that both the girl and the main accused the boy were in touch with each other from a long time. One of the person also alleged that it was girls mother and brother who took the girl in farm. Also there was a news article which stated that 3 boy\'s names were added after a week or so. I also heard the accused father\'s statement. He also pointed out the same that both girl and his son were in contact from long time. News reports also indicate that girl\'s brother already made several calls in last one year. So there\'s possibility that they were familiar with each other. Now there are reports coming out that Bhim Army and other party workers were in touch with the family members who could\'ve manipulated the whole set of event. I am insinuating since I don\'t have proof but the way politics have been played in this horrific incident is somewhat reasonable assumption.\n\nNow here\'s what bothers me. The police is complicit in this incident. There\'s no reasonable explanation to burn the body in middle of night in such a haste. Since there was so outrage and possible CBI/SIT inquiry was already looking plausible, the police burnt the body of the girl does indicate they didn\'t want others to find out what they had which might change the whole scenario.\n\nBurning the body swiftly doesn\'t make sense if the rape allegations are made. The forensics would\'ve easily find out whether the rape was committed or not. Since the boys are already arrested, now even their lawyers also would not be able to prove anything since body is already burned and this case will drag for months which will involve more political cloud on it. Everything will be taken based on what police have conjured up in the initial investigation. Even if SIT is formed they can only get circumstantial evidence as the real evidence which they could find out by examining the body is already burned.\n\nJust today morning watched some news which were saying that the "Bhabhi" from victim\'s family who was giving interviews to news channel is also fake.\n\nIf the boys are guilty they should be punished in harshest manner but if they are being framed, they should get a reasonable defense to present their case. MSM should also show what the accused\'s family are saying since there\'s reasonable counter arguments. I may be wrong and I would be happy to change my stand.'<br />Author: 'kaddu_karela'  id: 'j8fdns'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j8fdns/hathras_incident_my_observation_so_far_serious/</li>

Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one's faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called karma-kāṇḍa, fruitive activities, and sometimes jñāna-kāṇḍa, knowledge in the pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the ultimate aim of all sacrifices ?

      <li>Title::: 'Beyond the Tales of Tenali : A Glimpse into the Vijayanagara Empire'<br />Body: 'This post is the first post in a series of texts on Indian History I have been holding on to for some time now. Any claims I make in this series shall be backed by valid evidences. There might be certain portions of it you may not agree with, but that\'s not what History is about. You can\'t rewrite it.  Criticisms are welcome.\n\n\u200b\n\n"The size of this city I do not write here, because it cannot all be seen from any one spot, but I climbed a hill whence I could see a great part of it; I could not see it all because it lies between several ranges of hills. What I saw from thence seemed to me as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight; there are many groves of trees within it, in the gardens of the houses, and many conduits of water which flow into the midst of it, and in places there are lakes; and the king has close to his palace a palm-grove and other rich fruit-bearing trees."\n\n- Domingo Paes (Portuguese traveller; describing the city of Vijaynagara in its heyday)\n\n\u200b\n\nThe empire was founded in 1336 by two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, who claimed descent from the Yadavas. At it\'s zenith it stretched from the river Krishna in the north to the extreme south of the peninsula. In 1565 the city was sacked and subsequently deserted. Although it fell into ruin, it lived on in the memories of people living in the Krishna-Tungabhadra doab. They remembered it as Hampi, a name derived from that of a local deity, Pampa Devi. \n\nThe city of Vijayanagara is believed to be the site of the mythological city of Kishkindha. The city was a powerful urban centre in South India from 14th to 16th century and was possibly the second largest city in the world after Beijing. It stood as a bastion of Hindu values dedicated to fighting back the encroachments of the Muslim sultans from the north, who soon came to be operating from Golkonda.\n\nThe first dynasty, known as the Sangama dynasty, exercised control till 1485. They were supplanted by the Saluvas, their military commanders, who remained in power till 1503 when they were replaced by the Tuluvas. Krishnadeva Raya belonged to the Tuluva dynasty.\n\nKrishnadeva Raya’s rule was characterised by expansion and consolidation. Some of the most detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara come from his time or just after. \n\n"A king should improve the harbours of his country and so encourage its commerce that horses, elephants, precious gems, sandalwood, pearls and other articles are freely imported. He should arrange that the foreign sailors who land in his country on account of storms, illness and exhaustion are looked after in a suitable manner. Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses be attached to yourself by providing them with daily audience, presents and allowing decent profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies."\n\n- Krishnadeva Raya (Amuktamalyada)\n\n\u200b\n\nBattle of Raichur :-\n\nThe fort of Raichur was built by Kakatiya king Rudra in 1284 CE. The fort, along with other areas of the northern Deccan, was captured by Muhammad Bin Tughluq in 1323 CE. The Bahmani Sultanate captured the fort in 1347.\n\nThe immediate prelude to the Battle of Raichur began in the year 1520. In that year, Krishnadeva Raya sent Seyed Maraikar, a Muslim in his service, to Goa with a large sum of money to buy horses. Maraikar, however, went to Adil Khan with the money and offered his services to the sultanate in the name of Islam. Krishnadeva Raya made a demand that Maraikar be returned along with the money which was duly refused. This act of betrayal prompted Raya to attack Raichur, something he had already prepared for. Portuguese accounts state that cannons were used extensively by the Bijapur Sultanate; the Vijayanagara Empire used them minimally, at best. The Vijayanagara Empire emerged victorious despite the Bijapur Sultanate having superior firepower. \n\nThe battle of Raichur had far-reaching effects. The Hindu victory weakened the power and prestige of the Adil Shah. He turned his attention to making alliances with the other Muslim neighbours - An Islamic Brotherhood against Hindu Infidels\n\nKrishnadeva Raya passed away soon after the battle.\n\n\u200b\n\nBattle of Talikota :-\n\nThe reigns of the empire eventually fell to Rama Raya "Aliya" (son-in law in Kannada) after a period of civil war. The Muslim Sultanates to the north of Vijayanagara united and attacked Rama Raya\'s army, on 26 January 1565. \n\nThis battle, which had seemed an easy victory for the large Vijayanagar army, instead became a disaster as two Muslim commanders (Gilani brothers) of the Vijayanagara army betrayed and switched sides and turned their loyalty to the united Sultanates during critical point of battle. A subversive attack was launched by them. Suddenly Aliya found himself surprised when the two divisions in his ranks turned against him. They captured Aliya and beheaded him on the spot. \n\n(His severed head was displayed at Ahmednagar at the anniversaries of the battle of Talikota and would be covered in oil and red pigment by the descendants of his executioner.)\n\nThe beheading of Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which led to a complete rout. What ensued can never be adequately described by words alone.\n\n\u200b\n\n"With fire and sword, with crowbars and axes, they carried on day after day their work of destruction. Never perhaps in the history of the world has such havoc been wrought, and wrought so suddenly, on so splendid a city; teeming with a wealthy and industrious population in the full plenitude of prosperity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged, and reduced to ruins, amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors beggaring description."\n\n- Robert Sewell (The Forgotten Empire)\n\n\u200b\n\nThus ended the last great Hindu empire in the history of India....\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the next post in this series, I\'ll go into detail about the glorious city of Vijayanagara and the empire under Krishnadeva Raya.'<br />Author: 'MC_John-117'  id: 'j7qshj'<br />Score:80<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j7qshj/beyond_the_tales_of_tenali_a_glimpse_into_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.30'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What is the common aim of different types of sacrifices ? What is Brahman atmosphere ?**\n\n.\n\n**Answer 1 :** "From the foregoing explanation of different types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one\'s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.30, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b56ynavnawr51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b78fa4ee962ea5d988e61d14c35db0d5d0810896\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Netaji Bose or Nehru? Which one did Bhagat Singh believe was the greater revolutionary?'<br />Body: " \n\nBhagat Singh underlines Nehru's observation that we should not accept tales from religious books, if they do not stand the test of reason. To Bhagat Singh, Nehru was radical and desired reformation in the society, while Subhas Babu wanted the status quo and believed in everything ancient, whereas Nehru wanted a revolt against it. Nehru said those who believe that they could revive whatever existed a hundred years back, Nehru said, “I want to tell them that it was impossible. The world in our imagination might be still but the real world is not still”.\xa0\n\n\xa0Bhagat Singh felt that Bose demanded full Independence for India because the British were Western and we were oriental. Bose was thinking of the political freedom of the country, while Nehru's demand of freedom was to achieve the radical changes in our social, political and financial status. Bhagat Singh said that Nehru's thoughts were revolutionary and appealed to the mind as well as to the reason, while Subhas Babu's appealed only to the mind but not reason. \xa0\n\n\xa0Bhagat Singh then appealed to the young generation of Punjab not to be guided by emotion but by reason. He noted that Punjabis are emotional, they get excited instantly and then calm down quickly. \xa0He wanted to impress on the minds of the Punjab's youth that they needed intellectual food and not emotional stimulus. At the same time, he cautioned the people that they should not be blind followers.\xa0\n\n\xa0He stated firmly that India would achieve freedom and understand the status of freedom in the context of the world through Pandit Nehru's school of thoughts. We would then be spared of aimless intellectual wandering and saved from frustration.\xa0"<br />Author: 'adityanathrocks'  id: 'j7ai9n'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j7ai9n/netaji_bose_or_nehru_which_one_did_bhagat_singh/</li>

In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one's dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of yajña we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.-even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajña (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yajña according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajña. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the benefits of performing yajña according to the directions given in Vedas ?

Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yogīs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord Kṛṣṇa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only Kṛṣṇa prasādam, or food which is offered first to the Lord."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.29, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c72dfkwgmnr51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492b3fbe17dbb9b9a6b10deb822024e13be188b1\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : What is the common aim of different types of sacrifices ?

      <li>Title::: 'History of Jihad in India: Post Number 4'<br />Body: 'As explained in previous posts, Hindus were repulsed and disgusted with Islam and showed resistance towards conversion. So, the natural question arises: \n\nWhy and how as many as 20 percent of the Indians became Muslim despite their defiant resistance against Islam? How could the Muslim population swell when Hindus found Islam so repugnant, as attested by the records of many Muslim chroniclers and rulers?\n\nThere were numerous ways, the first of which shall be explained in this post:\n\n***Conversion by the sword***\n\nConversion by the sword was initiated by Prophet Muhammad by giving the Polytheists a choice between death and conversion to Islam in compliance to Allah’s command in Quran 9:5. The Hindus, therefore, were supposed to be given a choice between death and Islam.\n\nWhen Muhammad bin Qasim began the conquest of Sindh, he exercised the policy of converting the people of a territory, which gave a fight, at the pain of death. He gave quarters to the people, if they submitted to his invading army without giving a fight. He did not force them to convert. When the report of his latter lenient policy reached his patron Hajjaj in Baghdad, disapproving the leniency, he wrote to Qasim:\n\n‘…I learnt that the ways and rules you follow are conformable to the (Islamic) Law. Except that you give protection to all, great and small alike, and make no difference between enemy and friend. God says, ‘Give no quarter to Infidels, but cut their throats.’ Then know that this is the command of the great god. You should not be too ready to grant protection… After this, give no protection to any enemy except to those who are of rank (i.e., accept Islam). This is a worthy resolve, and want of dignity will not be imputed to you.’  \\[1\\]\n\nHaving received this command from Hajjaj, Qasim followed it through in his next conquest of Brahmanabad, sparing none who did not embrace Islam. According to al-Biladuri, ‘eight, or some say twenty-six thousand, men were put to the sword.’ \\[2\\] However, putting the great multitude of Hindus, who often refused to embrace Islam, to death was difficult. Instead, giving them quarters for raising taxes was a more lucrative alternative. Qasim later wrote to Hajjaj in this regard. In response, Hajjaj wrote back:\n\n‘The letter of my dear nephew Muhammad Kasim has been received and the fact understood. It appears that the chief inhabitants of Brahmanabad had petitioned to be allowed to repair the temple of Budh and pursue their religion. As they have made submission, and agreed to pay taxes to the Khalifa, nothing can be properly required from them. They have been taken under our protection (*dhimmi*), and we cannot in any way stretch out our hands upon their lives or property.’ \\[3\\]\n\nHindus were, thus, accepted as *dhimmi* subjects, which spared them from conversion by the sword. The Godless Umayyad rulers were more interested in filling the treasury by extracting higher taxes from non-Muslim subjects than converting them to Islam.\n\nFor example, al-Hajjaj harshly treated those, who converted to Islam. \\[4\\] When a group of non-Muslims came to him to inform their acceptance of Islam, al-Hajjaj refused to recognize their conversion and ordered his troops to return them to their villages. \\[5\\]\n\nThe first Umayyad Caliph Muwabiya desperately wanted the Egyptian Copts not to convert to Islam, ‘claiming that if they all convert to the true religion (Islam), they will cause the treasury a great loss in income from the *jizyah*.’ \\[6\\]\n\nThe leniency, accorded to Hindus by the Godless Umayyads, was obviously a violation of the canonical Islamic laws of the Quran and *Sunnah*. This irreverent concession was later included in the Hanafi laws; all other Schools of Islamic laws demand death or conversion of Polytheists. Therefore, as far as forced conversion is concerned, the infidels of India suffered the mildest of persecution.\n\nFollowing the extermination of the Godless Umayyad dynasty in 750, the more orthodox rulers often converted Hindus at the pain of death. Saffaride ruler Yakub Lais captured Kabul in 870 and took the prince of Kabul prisoner. He put the king of Ar-Rukhaj to death, destroyed and plundered the temples and *the inhabitants were* *forced to embrace Islam*. He returned to his capital loaded with booty, which included heads of three kings and many statues of Indian divinities. \\[7\\]\n\nIn Sultan Mahmud’s conquest of Kanauj, ‘the inhabitants either accepted Islam or took up arms against him to become the food of Islamic swords,’ records his secretary Abu Nasr al-Utbi. \\[8\\] In the captured of Baran, records al-Utbi, ‘since God’s sword was drawn from the scabbard, and the whip of punishment was uplifted… ten thousand men proclaimed their anxiety for conversion and their rejection of idols.’ \\[9\\]\n\nAfter conquering a city, Sultan Mahmud—an educated cultured man and a master of Islamic jurisprudence (*fiqh*)—would normally slaughter the men of fighting age, enslave their women and children and force the remaining inhabitants to embrace Islam. He used to place on the throne a converted prince, who must run the affairs of the state according to Islamic laws and oversee the propagation of Islam and the suppression of idol-worship. One such converted prince was Nawasa Shah.\n\nAfter Sultan Mahmud retired from India, records al-Utbi, ‘Satan had got the better of Nawasa Shah, for he was again apostatizing towards the pit of plural worship… So the Sultan went swifter than the wind in that direction, and made the sword reek with the blood of his enemies.’ \\[10\\] This means that Sultan Mahmud did not simply convert the Hindus by the sword in his campaigns in India, but he also made it sure that the converts did not revert to their ancestral faith after his return to Ghazni.\n\nWe will see in later posts that, in the course of India’s Partition in 1947, a few million Hindus and Sikhs were converted to Islam at the pain of death in East and West Pakistan.\n\n1.

The word comes from the Old French orange, from the old term for the fruit, pomme d'orange. The French word, in turn, comes from the Italian arancia, based on Arabic nāranj (نارنج), derived from the Sanskrit nāraṅga (नारङ्ग), which in turn derives from a Dravidian root word (compare நரந்தம் narandam which refers to Bitter orange in Tamil).\n\nThe earliest known recorded use of orange (in Europe) as a colour name in English was in 1502, in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor.

      <li>Title::: 'Why do Indians (especially Hindu nationalists) claim Mughals looted India, when all economic data and reputable sources show that Indian economy and social indicators?'<br />Body: "I am genuinely curious why a large portion of Indians claim that Mughals looted India, when all economic indicators and all reputable sources show the contrary. Under Mughal rule, Indian economy exceeded growth of prior 1,500 years. Mughals were also responsible of industrialization, high degree of urbanization and extensive road system. \n\nIf Mughals looted from India:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Since India was the birthplace of Mughal emperors, where did they exactly look the money to?\n2. If Mughals looted India, how did India experience a great degree of development under Mughal than it did in prior 1,500 years?\n3. If Mughals looted India, why did British set their eyes on India as their crown jewel. Considering Mughals looted India, how can a place that has been looted be a crown jewel?\n4. India's exports earnings increased tenfold under Mughal empire? Why would looter a country increase exports earning of the country it is looting?\n5. Exactly what was looted from India?\n6. India first emerged as the largest economy of the world two decades into Mughal reign, and fell from the position as the Mughals started losing power. Should the results be opposite?\n7. India's per capita income went from $450 to 550 between 0AD. to 1500 AD. and rocketed to $782 during first 100 years of Mughal rule.\n\nIn my opinion, the only one who can be categorized as looters are the British. Plus, It's important to keep in mind there were no such country as India. Back then, empires were equivalent to what we consider as nation these days. \n\nKeeping the religious bias or politics are, I am curious to know what did Mughals do to be considered looters? Please cite academic sources (OpIndia, TOI are not academic sources). No personal opinions or skewed data please. No personal attacks to respondents either please. Lets have a civilized and academic conversation.  \n\nI am aware the religious discrimination, social injustice all that can be debatable, but I am curious strictly on economic terms."<br />Author: 'LSATExam001'  id: 'j5mkvo'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j5mkvo/why_do_indians_especially_hindu_nationalists/</li>

In no way there were any copyright infringements in this video. You can find the video on my youtube channel or twitter (@WhiteHatSnr). So now Aiplex or Byjus won't apologize for removing the video? Just like that, they can remove anyone's videos?\n* For the rest of the video, youtube rejected my appeal stating ' *Thank you for your counter-notification. Unfortunately, it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request.* One of the videos which was removed was a screen recording of my phone, where I click on Google Play, open whiteharJr app, and check its reviews, the third and fourth videos were exactly the same, word to word. That's the video, hardly 30 seconds, no background music or commentary. Yet it was removed for 'CopyRight Infringements'.\n\n# Channel number 2, named 'Safed Topi Sr 2'.7 videos were removed from here.\n\n* Videos were removed for reasons such as 'WhiteHatJr logo is shown on top left corner of the screen'. So I uploaded the same video with its entire screen blurred. And that video was also removed by WhiteHatJr for copyright Infringements.\n* In one video I show every 5-star fake review of WhiteHatJr app on GooglePlay Store. This video getting banned seems so strange because I am showing fake reviews on Google Play Store which Google itself should not allow in the first place, and then their own Sibling company Youtube removes video. And then also rejects all my counter-notification stating I don't have any valid reason.\n* Wolf Gupta video: This kid does not exist. And WhiteHatJr keeps changing his age from 9-14 years old and his salary from 1.2 crore rupees to 20 crores and then 150 crores. And this Wolf Gupta supposedly works in Google. So when I make a video on this, instead of taking any actions against WhiteHatJr, Google (YouTube) removes my video. Now Byjus higher mgmt says if Google/Barak Obama/Blue Origin/Elon Musk/Bill gates etc doesn't have any issue in whitehatjr using their pics, who am I to say anything. Well, its the public who is getting fooled with false advertisements, Elon Musk doesn't have time to look into WhiteHatJr ads!\n* Videos on this channel got removed with in 30-45 minutes of getting uploaded. The entire channel was banned permanently so fast that I didnt even get time to file appeal for some of the videos.\n\n# Channel number 3, named 'Pradeep Poonia 3.0'.Three videos have been removed from here till now.\n\n* Some people suggested that my videos were getting removed because I used WhiteHat name. So I left that name after the second channel itself. And used my own name in this third channel. Here also videos are getting removed. One more strike, this channel would also be gone.\n* The 'CLOUD' video is also removed.

I really want to adopt them, but I dunno if its the best thing to do. She had 3 children, and I have 3 children of my own as well. So as you can see if I adopt them it would be 6 children... which I do not know if I can handle (both physically (looking after each child) and financially (I had planned for 3 children, so even with the surplus money I doubt I could handle 3 more)). I am also worried of impact it would have on my wife of adopting 3 children of my sister's (though my wife is very sweet and caring). I honestly never planned for this. Usually other family members step in and adopt but in my case, we don't have any family relatives (only few distant ones, our parents are dead, and my parents immediate siblings died before they had children). I am too scared to leave those kids for random adoption, no idea how they would be treated growing up. If I was to take them in what would be psychological impact of them, would they mix well with my kids? Would I be able to build a child-parent relationship with them. Is it fair to cut down financially on my own kids to accommodate for the new children? I thought of sending them to boarding school, but it seems really harsh, as I would never do that to my child and I want my sister's children to be the best as well...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so confused, I don't know what to do honestly...

My political opinion doesn\'t resonate with the political opinion of the majority in this sub, but I\'m in this sub because its "India" and I\'m an Indian.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I don\'t know why the majority in this subreddit are against the ruling party, I find this to be pure bias. You ignore whatever good is done by the govt and only are triggered when they do something wrong. Is it because of the mods of this sub? Do they go on deleting all the posts which support the ruling party? if yes then isn\'t this supression of opinions? If you do these practices then aren\'t you being a hypocrite?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr is it because the posts which support the ruling party whenever they take any good decisions or do anything good, doesn\'t get popular enough due the population of this sub? But again since we have a democracy, majority wins, and we have seen in both 2014 and 2019 elections who is the majority. I believe at least a bit similar trend should have been displayed in this sub as well right? Hmm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be honest all I see in this sub are some cartoons/memes which are being shared and are getting popular because they mock the current government. Did you guys actually go out and vote if you had a problem with this government? or do you think that making memes in this sub will solve all problems and maybe replace the current govt or make them listen to your concerns?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo we actually know what is the reality behind the situation? were you actually present in the situation to know what is the truth and what isn\'t? or do you want to believe something to be the truth because it suits your agenda? or believe anything shown to you by your fav media sources? How can you justify that your media source is authentic while other media sources are not?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw a recent post again in this sub where the picture of rahul gandhi visiting the hathras victim is compared with picture of nirbhaya parents visitng the PM. Now why aren\'t you pointing out that why did RaGa went there with a camera crew if it was just for a "visit"? oh maybe because that doesn\'t suit your agenda? you would only point out the PR Stunt or publicity for a specific individual and turn a blind eye for other. doesn\'t this feel hypocritic?. Besides what point are you trying to make by comparing those two photographs? Do you go judge people by the photographs without knowing the entire context? How would it feel if somebody judges you solely based on your one bad past photograph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m not expecting this post to be visible in your reddit front page since it is not aligned with opinion of the majority in here, but still I decided to post it out. I would be surprised if this post doesn\'t get deleted. Expecting to see some more logical and unbiased debates and discussions in here.

      <li>Title::: 'Politicization of Rapes'<br />Body: 'Most of the Indians today and in the past are divided on the basis of politics. There are BJP/Congress/AAP/Communists along with leftists, right wingers, centrists and all kinds of people. Infact, politics are something in which the nation is divided more than anything else. \n\nRape and Sexual Harrasment are such crimes that the nation needs to be UNITED to combat them, irrespective of one\'s political ideology, religion, caste or sex. \n\nIt\'s extremely sad that our politicians and their parties, so called journalists, activists, bollywoodiias find these rape cases as a playground to dump their shit on. They look at rapes just as an opportunity to flex their ideologies, blame other religions, castes, politicians instead of working in harmony with everyone to give justice to the victims. \n\nAround 80-90 rapes and other sexual harassment cases happen in India daily, but the outrage is only against those cases which tick the propaganda checklists of these so called comedians, bollywoodiias, activists, journalists and feminists. Is the victim a minority or a lower caste? Check! Is the rapist a upper caste/majority? Check! Is the location/state where the rape happened ruled by BJP? Check! The same goes for Congress ruled states as well. BJP is no saint. The Hathras case is an example of this, and the Asifa rape case is the best example of them all. That case was a fucking goldmine for all the propaganda spreading mechanism. The victim being a Muslim and the accused being a BJP politician, along with the rape happening in a "DEVI" temple were fucking cherries on top of the ice cream for these people. \n\nThe fact that many of the rapists today still roam free and tens of thousands of victims have been denied justice because these cases don\'t fit in the propaganda checklists of all these opportunistic people is the proof that all of the outrage for Hathras/Asifa case is just an hate spreading agenda against upper caste people in the former and against Hindus in the latter. Hate the rapist. Not his religion or his caste or his whole community. \n\nBringing hate in the middle of the war against rape and sexual harrasment is just going to weaken us by causing fights and blame games within ourselves. It\'s high time that we stop this bullshit among ourselves and keep our resolve to fight sexual crimes united as a nation, irrespective of one\'s political, religious identity.'<br />Author: 'awisekiddo'  id: 'j5dv3e'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j5dv3e/politicization_of_rapes/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Misconceptions about Hinduism created by the West (Part 1)'<br />Body: '        There are several false information about our beliefs as our "Uppercasts" have become weak. To make everyone understand the the truth, they must first understand why it is false.\n\n        Our nation is very old and there is no need to prove that we are old. We have waged the highest number of wars and still are the only ancient civilization alive. Romans, Persians, Egyptians, Greeks, Ethiopians have all faded. They were either converted or beheaded. Then why was our nation the only exception? We were also tried in the same way but the people were more focused on their work and believed in their king rather than a black cloak with a book in his hand.\n\n        We are told about our Caste system. More specifically it is called "gens" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gens). We have our Gotr system to divide the population and organize the marriages so that there is no incest, no similar genes mixing giving birth to a half or quarter minded human.\n\n        To understand why it was so and why Brahman were held in "high regard" we need to understand what Jaati vyavastha or Varn ashram are. In Gurukul, children were admitted from the age of 5 to 6. There they learnt social values and that every human rich or poor is a human. No one helped them in this 10 year period and they had to clean their own room, farm their own land so as to create the idea of independency. In Yajnopavit sanskar, men were asked to beg on the streets for food so that they understand how the poors lived.\n\n        The main thing which might hurt feelings of a few. Girls were not allowed in Gurukul. They disrupt the discipline and focus and were not allowed in Gurukul. An average man is better than an average woman in whatever possible cases. If a father wishes to teach or educate her daughter, he had to do it himself. This was the main quality and crucial for the social discipline. No man looked at a foreign woman (not related by any means) with lust and if he did he was punished cruelly so as to discipline the society. A married woman leaved her house either with her husband or with their son. A vidhwa (a vidhwa is a married woman who no longer has a man to support her, here a man includes her husband or their son) was respected in the whole town and the head was supposed to take care of her survival.\n\n        Shudra never faced any ignorance or being left aside by other high rankings of the society. In Gurukul most students were shudra as they were the most important in handling and maintaining the structure of our society. Shudra were engineers, craftsmen, repairmen, researchers and many other things. Now. Why were Brahman considered higher than the others? There are two ways of thinking. One is Bauddhik and the other is Adhyatmik. If you are a Brahman and are reading this, try to make yourself more suitable before calling yourself one. If you have not completed Yajnopavit sanskar, you cannot be a Brahman. There are three Sandhya to be performed by the Brahman in a day. Jap of mulmantr at least 108 times in a day. If they fail to do so without a legitimate reason, they had to apologize for the inability before starting again. Ved or Puran paath for the rest of the day and to share the new knowledge achieved with others so as to take the society higher. They performed Yajn and Puja for either new values in life or for the celebrations on festivals or specific dates.\n\n        All the discipline and rules Brahman take care of for the only purpose of well being of the society, they don\'t have much time left to earn food. So they rely on begging for survival or if they are knowledgeable enough, they had their own Ashram. This is why Brahman are to be respected and were respected. But later all because Kshatriya children were trained by Brahman, Kshatriya respected them and as Kshatriya held power, the other two varg respected them.\n\n        We right now treat Shudra as malaecchh. Shudra are too high to be treated like that. A figure of God is mentioned where the Head is Brahman, meaning the guide the society in the right direction and all the thinking part of what would be the best for them. Kshatriya as hands so as to prevent any type of attack or damage to the society. Vaishya as the main body which signifies that they are critical for appetite and respiration of the society through trade and commerce. Shudra as legs as the foundation of the society to keep the society standing at all times, allowing it to move forward. If all the parts function together, a society can keep going higher. If any one part fails. Society would collapse.\n\n        We are alive because the values our ancestors have inlaid are still there. Mouselimbs failed, shoes surround the X-men and they target the ideologically weaker sections of society like the fishermen, farmers, labours, Adivasi in the forests. All this is to take the shoreline in their control and to establish a constant network through the forests to organize riots and rebellions.\n\n        The posts would continue, try to understand them rather than feeling targetted or anything else. The difference between independence and freedom, why only the battles that we have lost are mentioned in our history books, why we are forced to believe AIT like baseless theories, why rivers and ecosystem are polluting from Hindu festivals, why cultural heads like Shankaracharya and Asharam are taken to the court in disrespectful manner in the worst cars available and why the dads if found guilty are taken in air conditioned cars and hotels. Try to understand it and spread the right information. Any single mistake would just create another death trap for us.'<br />Author: 'POMPOMBALLS0'  id: 'j5dha3'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j5dha3/misconceptions_about_hinduism_created_by_the_west/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Macron vows to fight Islamic separatism, Azerbaijan's city bombed, and the story of Kwame Nkrumah"<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread, where we discuss all the news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India, and users are encouraged to share and discuss stories in the comments. Here are a few stories to get the discussion rolling:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [Macron vows to fight Islamic separatism in France](https://apnews.com/article/religion-paris-france-emmanuel-macron-islam-40615a00b39123ff8bcbd5ce705b88f5)\n\nIn a scathing speech to a working-class Parisian suburb, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to fight what we calls "Islamic separatism," which is Muslims in France living in a parallel society separate from French values and customs. His plan includes a law that would limit the scope of religious schools (madrasas), prevent gender-based segregation in public locations such as swimming pools, and stop Imams from receiving foreign training. France has Europe\'s largest Muslim population. A Pak-origin man stabbed two people outside the office of Charlie Hebdo (the satirical magazine that published the cartoons of the prophet Muhammad) recently.\n\n2. [Donald Trump comes down with COVID-19](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-covid-19-updates-sunday/h_45e7def48b633071cd2a22c7818006dc)\n\nAfter months of downplaying the virus and holding large, mostly mask-free rallies, US President Donald Trump, his wife, and several aides tested positive for COVID-19. As a precautionary measure, he was shifted to a military hospital, where he is being administered with several medications, including steroids and an experimental cocktail of antibodies. He was briefly driven out of the hospital to greet supporters waiting outside, a move that drew criticism because it exposed his security staff to the virus (he did wear a mask in this case).\n\n3. [Major clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/04/920120169/destruction-mounts-as-azerbaijan-and-armenia-increase-hostilities)\n\nFighting between the Caucasian states of Armenia and Azerbaijan reached a new high, with Azerbaijan\'s second-largest city, Ganja, being bombed with missiles. The two countries are fighting over the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh, which is officially recognized as Azeri territory by most countries but claimed by Armenia. The territory is Christian- and Armenian-majority, even as Azerbaijan is overwhelmingly Shia Muslim. Both countries were part of the Soviet Union. Regional power Turkey has joined the war in support of Azerbaijan.\n\n4. [Japan\'s DefMin asks for historic budget increase](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/asia/japan-military-budget-2020-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\nJapan\'s Defense Ministry is proposing a hike of 8.3% in its annual budget, the highest increase in 20 years, in response to China\'s rapid military growth as well as continued hostilities from North Korea. If approved, the budget would rise to about $52 bn, still a fraction of China\'s official annual military budget of $178 bn. The new spending would go towards improving the Japanese Self-Defense Forces\' space and cyber capabilities, even as the country grows increasingly worried about the pace at which the PLA Navy is acquiring new ships.\n\n5. [Nigeria celebrated 60 years of Independence](https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-54368921)\n\nAfrica\'s most populous nation, Nigeria, celebrated 60 years of Independence from British occupation on October 1. President Muhammadu Buhari marked the occasion through a military parade in the country\'s capital, Abuja, even as questions grew about his authoritarian rule, deep divisions within society, and the future of a country that is addicted to exporting oil with very little human development to show for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Kwame Nkrumah\n\nThe story of African independence from colonial occupation is long and difficult, full of celebrated figures who turned villains. In a series of posts, Geopolitical History will talk about some of these leaders who the history books often forget or abridge. The first leader is Ghana\'s independence hero and democracy\'s villain, Kwame Nkrumah. Born in 1909 in Ghana (which was then called the Gold Coast under British occupation, next to the French-occupied Ivory Coast) to a poor family, Nkrumah studied in the US and UK and eventually led his country to freedom, before being exiled himself.\n\nAfter receiving a certificate in education, Nkrumah became a humble headmaster at a Catholic school, but soon joined in the country\'s politics. Resentment against the British was high - they first used the territory in the Atlantic slave trade, and then economically exploited the population, often with racism mixed in. In the age of African and Black nationalism, he decided to further his education and attended Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, USA, the country where he spent 10 years of his life, teaching, preaching, and promoting solidarity in racially-segregated America. \n\nIn 1945, he moved to London just as WW2 ended, to get a PhD in anthropology. However, he dropped out soon after and instead immersed himself in political movements for African independence and socialism. In this, he was joined by a venerable group of African nationalists, including the future leaders of Kenya and Nigeria. He was largely successful: Britain had barely survived the War, and the imminent loss of India meant that she could not maintain a large colonial empire any longer. In 1946, African-majority rule within the Commonwealth was granted to the Gold Coast, and Nkrumah moved back to his home country in 1947. After much political fighting and rioting for total independence, Nkrumah founded his own party - the Convention People\'s Party (CPP) - in 1949, and in the 1951 elections, his party won 34 of 38 seats where Africans could contest, and he became Prime Minister.\n\nHowever, Nkrumah was not happy. Although Britain granted much self-government to what was still its colony, the Parliamentary system left Nkrumah with limited powers. In 1957, Ghana achieved full independence, but with Nkrumah still smarting over limits imposed on his power by a new constitution and parliamentary democracy. Nonetheless, he was hailed all over the world as a great new leader for a free Africa. But within a year, he became highly suspicious of other political parties as well as the military, passing laws giving the government the power of detention without trial and abolishing state assemblies. In 1960, Ghana adopted a new Constitution with an executive president, which Nkrumah assumed. \n\nSoon enough, Nkruman started creating a cult around himself, with his followers calling him  \'Osagyefo\' (Redeemer). In 1964, his party passed a law granting him the power to remove any and all judges as he wished, effectively abolishing the independent judiciary. The same year, he "won" a referendum by 99.91% of the vote to abolish all other parties but his, and declared himself as President for life, essentially turning his country into a dictatorship. In 1966, while on a state visit to Communist China and Vietnam, his government was overthrown by a military coup. He never returned to Ghana, where he would\'ve been arrested on arrival. Instead, he lived as a state guest in Guinea, growing increasingly paranoid of assassination by the CIA. He died in 1972 of prostate cancer, and his remains were finally returned to his country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'j5ct5e'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j5ct5e/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_macron/</li>

Not surprisingly, before and after that day, more people lost their lives at the ghaats, too.\n\n\nHe mentioned how unprotected the ghaats are in here. (We are in Patna, Bihar) And he bought up an idea which was roughly this :\n\n"There are so many unemployed youngsters just hanging around the ghaat all day long. The government can train them in CPR and swimming and they could act like lifeguards with a monthly salary. Two birds with one stone."\n\n\nNow, I am aware this is very unrealistic, like we cant just pick up unemployed people and train them and boom, unemployment solved.\n\n\nBut, the truth is, our ghaats, especially the ones behind the great line of colleges which goes on for quite a long distance, COULD use some lifeguards. His life could have been saved if there was a trained professional to save him. I thought maybe the ghaats could also be supplied with life jackets but they\'ll probably end up stolen anyway so eh. \n\n\nI wanted to ask, is there any effective way to present this idea to our local government? Any way we could be heard? Do we need public support? Is this realistic or we just think its easy because it\'s just so personal to us and we don\'t understand the complications?

      <li>Title::: 'Book review: Why growth matters - How Economic Growth in India Reduced Poverty and the Lessons for Other Developing Countries by Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagariya'<br />Body: '[The book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15843183-why-growth-matters?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=J7j3Al92R0&amp;rank=1) is divided into 3 parts. The first part talks about the "myths" that were prevalent among certain economists and activists regarding India\'s growth policy post 1991 liberalization. The authors address concerns around the new policy not being inclusive, that it did not help get rid of poverty, that it increased income inequality and that it did not help in betterment of health and education sector. The authors debunk these comprehensively using relevant data, and also describe the sorry state of Indian economy before 1991.\n\n The second part deals with the "Track 1 reforms", which are reforms aimed directly at increasing economy growth rate. The authors talk in detail about land and labor laws, policies relating to education and infrastructure and suggest ways in which these can be improved.\n\n The final part talks about "Track 2 reforms", which are reforms aimed at redistribution, and help the poorest sections of the society. As in the previous part, the authors here talk about ways to make effective policies for uplifting the underprivileged sections, they talk about employment, nutrition, healthcare and education areas where reforms are most important.\n\n The authors call out the policymakers for absurd decisions, especially in the pre 1991 era. They put out comparison with similar Asian countries to show how India could have done better. They also highlight the fact that after liberalization, India still couldn\'t achieve what most east Asian countries could and why the UPA government after 2004 was wrong to divert their attention almost completely to redistribution policies rather than taking a balanced approach. However, they also mention all the things that India has done in the right direction and the results that such policies have yielded.\n\n Overall, the book is well written. It is easy to read and understand even for a person who is not well versed with economics. The authors put out relevant data and statistics to support their stand. The book provides a good view of how the Indian economy was before 1991, how it changed after that, and what further policy changes should be introduced to help India achieve desired levels of development.'<br />Author: 'eternalrocket'  id: 'j4xfhd'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j4xfhd/book_review_why_growth_matters_how_economic/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] Local language should be the compulsory medium of education in schools'<br />Body: 'The recent National Education Policy has been released with a view to transform education in India. On the question of language, the policy states \n\n&gt; Wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home-language/mother-tongue/local-language/regional-language. Thereafter, the home/local language shall continue to be taught as a language wherever possible. This will be followed by both public and private schools. \n\nThis is still only a recommendation, as the words "wherever possible" suggests. Research has consistently shown that being educated in a local language leads to far better educational outcomes for a longer period than having to learn a new language for school. However, in India most parents opt for an English medium education for their children citing the superior employment opportunities that it provides. Some governments have followed suit as well. Recently, the Andhra Pradesh government announced that all its schools would switch to English as the medium of instruction, and Karnataka, UP and other states are also going towards starting more English medium schools. \n\nThere is also the added complication of the medium of instruction for inter-state migrants and linguistic minorities. \n\nThe motion proposes that the local language should be the compulsory medium of education in all schools, where the local language can be duly notified at the state or district level.\n\n*[for] Those who are in support of the motion.*\n\nor\n\n*[Against] Those who are not in support of the motion.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Pick a side - For or Against (Based off the topic/what you want to defend).

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Casteism: Neither Monolithic nor Set in Stone'<br />Body: 'Social Inequality of what, for what? \n\nDomination in society!\n\nHuman beings are negentropic; seeking order in chaos and valuing security (and indemnity) of food, mates, amenities and resources for sustenance, exploiting opportunities, enduring cataclysmic disasters unwaveringly and subsequently fueling their \'alter ego, esteem and self-actualization\'. In more severe and resource scarce pre-modern times this was accomplished by despotic tyranny over those pliant enough through exercising perks of clout and being beneficiaries of communal coalescence. This was legitimized by the sacrosanct dicta of ‘professing’ and often actually being convinced themselves of fallacies such as divine right, material assets, evolutionary superiority or intrinsic virtue of family or blood.\n\n ‘Social Inequality’ has been present across all times and all lands in different forms, shades, degrees whilst being innocuous and surreptitiously malignant - In England, disenfranchising poor men and all women. In ancient Rome, slavery. In America, racism against people of coloured skin. In France, censitary suffrage.\n\n India, a country of multi-cultural religious faiths and beliefs which self-exalts its capability to have ‘unity-in-diversity’ has long fought the battle of and for group-identity.\n\n The caste system in India is a paradigmatic, endogamy-adhering quintessential exemplar of casteism. It consists of two different concepts, ‘varna’ and ‘jati’, which may be regarded as different degrees of analyses of this system.\n\n The lower castes were believed to be ethnographically and inherently inferior to their anterior counterparts due to the reliance on the expository that the disparities originated from the depiction of Brahma, the Hindu God of creation itself. Caste predicated almost every aspect of Hindu pious and social life, with each group pre-ordained to a specific place in this composite hierarchy.\n\n Communities were long organized on the basis of castes - the upper and lower castes almost always lived in sequestered colonies, the water-wells weren\'t shared, Brahmins wouldn\'t accept food or drinks from the Shudras, the lower-castes were not permitted to read or interpret the sacred texts, one could marry only within one\'s caste and the ‘Dalits’ were termed (and deemed) as ‘Untouchables’. Ironically enough, these people were later dubbed as ‘Harijans’ by Gandhi, which transliterates to ‘Children of God’. \n\nManusmriti, the most cardinal and formidable account of Hindu law, dating back to at least a 1,000 years before Christ was born, "acknowledges and justifies the caste system as the basis of serenity and homogeneity of society". \n\nAlbeit it is imperative to know what supersedes this. Caste wasn’t prestidigitated out of thin-air so to speak. It was brought into the gallows by someone. Only much later was it transmogrified and subverted to cater to the ulterior motives of megalomatics. Caste didn’t per se differentiate people divinely and dogmatically. It held in high regards all those who could be purveyors of different services to the society and so it did for an era. ‘People were merely identified with the trade’ they dealt in. Neither was it prohibited to change trades. Thus caste in essence was \'fluid\'. It is hence a simulacrum of sorts in a gallery. The discrepancies were perpetuated with the ‘perceived virtue’ of trades incrementally over epochs.\n\n What this requisitely implies is, due to \'historical background\' and \'socio-religious connotations\', reinforced by \'human psychology and anthropology\' the mass became so docile in as to be deprived of their perspicacity and condoning in nature to the established strata. In aggregate, ‘it’ acquiesced. Those who did try to revolt en masse were quickly smoldered in a vitriol by the malevolent turned upper castes in similitude to that of the Roman Catholic Church; the remnants who sought salvation for their disobedience were anathematised. \n\nHistory is itself evident with a disquieting suggestion that which is to be allegorically derived from confabulations and symposiums of the old. Though it may seem strange, even savant philosophers of great stature such as Plato and Aristotle could not contemplate of a society free of slavery and dominance. Their rationality came to an end descriptive with the aspect that the production and assistance delivered by the servants in the society was a compelling motive in the hegemonization of the same. \n\nIt is truly exhilarating to reminisce how far our antecedents have come as a pre-cursor to such a credible and autonomous \'society\'.

      <li>Title::: 'The Indian media and rape'<br />Body: 'I saved this comment I found in another sub:\n\n&gt;The Indian media is to blame for Indian men being universally labeled as gang rapists. No other country has hundreds of hysterical English-language media outlets that turn every rape and every grizzly detail of that rape into breaking front-page news for the whole world to see.\n\n&gt;In most other countries rape is almost only mentioned in the local language and in local (city-wide or otherwise subnational) news outlets making it harder to go viral and for international news outlets like BBC, CNN and NYT to cover the story.\n\n&gt;Rape in Western countries are mostly covered by [local news outlets](https://i.redd.it/n80cx2cjjzw21.png) and they avoid all the macabre and noticeable details.\n\n&gt;Lets look at how Western countries cover rape cases: In Missouri, USA [a woman was abducted, drugged and gang raped for several days](https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Four-men-charged-with-kidnapping-raping-Springfield-woman-for-days-in-Lawrence-county-559758921.html). This Missouri case was only mentioned in a few local (city/state) news outlets. None of them have used the term "gang rape" about the incident. Not a single big US media outlet has reported on the incident. It\'s almost like they don\'t want the rest of the world to hear about it.\n\n&gt;Here is another example: [These four men in Kentucky, USA gang raped a girl and filmed it.](https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/4-Kentucky-men-ages-18-or-19-indicted-on-rape-charges-513139531.html) The term "gang rape" is not used at all in the article. Instead of writing that the men filmed their gang rape the article only used the term "video voyeurism". This Kentucky case was also never mentioned in the big American news outlets.\n\n&gt;In India both of these rape cases would be front-page breaking news on IndiaToday for the whole world to see.\n\n&gt;TL;DR:\n\n&gt; 1. The Indian media sucks.\n\n&gt; 2. The Indian English-language media sucks and has made the whole world hate India and especially Indian men.'<br />Author: 'metalflare'  id: 'j48evn'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j48evn/the_indian_media_and_rape/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Sources against the narrative that "India has a Rape Culture".'<br />Body: 'Against the narrative that "India has a Rape Culture"\n\nPeople  who say India has a "rape culture" and start labeling all of us as  rapists, read this (I\'ve written this in the context of USA, but it  applies to most western countries) :\n\n1. First fact: Media reporting standards are not the same  \n.  \nIndia\'s  media reports things differently from media in other parts of the  world. Media reports in various parts of the world have themes. American  media focus a lot on race issues. Middle East media focuses a lot on  sectarian issues. Indian media focuses a lot on gender issues. It would  be faulty to not recognize the themes and blindly use media as a  barometer.  \n.  \nCrimes get a disproportionate share of India\'s media  reporting. Top news sources in the US, don\'t report rapes in the way  India does. For instance, 25 women in the US were raped/assaulted in the  time I took to write this comment (about 30 mins). You wouldn\'t likely  read about any of these 25 cases in the media.  \nWhen a woman was  sexually assaulted in an Uber taxi in Delhi, it became a major news and  the government quickly reacted. But, such crimes involving Uber is  fairly routine in the US.  \nSources:  \n[http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/16/least-two-women-who-reported-sexual-assaults-boston-sunday-were-using-uber-police-say/cFHpgzcfIoBYiTfWgOqYOK/story.html](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/16/least-two-women-who-reported-sexual-assaults-boston-sunday-were-using-uber-police-say/cFHpgzcfIoBYiTfWgOqYOK/story.html)  \n[http://abc7news.com/325011/](http://abc7news.com/325011/)  \n[http://www.whosdrivingyou.org/rideshare-incidents.html#SexualAssaults](http://www.whosdrivingyou.org/rideshare-incidents.html#SexualAssaults)  \n.  \nIn  the US and Europe, such rape stories would come in local media and just  move out of national attention. You probably didn\'t even come across  it. US local governments didn\'t pursue Uber with the same vigor. Indian  media selectively picks up a case and rallies around that. This creates a  distorted reality.  \n.  \nThe sad truth is that it is not India vs.  US. It is that women get raped and it doesn\'t become a big news. See  this as a global problem.\n\n2. Second fact: India\'s rape rate is not the highest in the world. Not even close  \n.  \nAccording  to the 2010 UN data on rape, the rapes per 100,000 people in India is  0.4 and 27.3 in USA. Going by these statistics, rape rate in USA is a  whopping 6825% of India, so much for the "rape culture" in India.  \nSources:  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape\\_statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics)  \n[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/top-5-countries-highest-rates-rape-1434355](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/top-5-countries-highest-rates-rape-1434355) [http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Rapes/Per-capita](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Rapes/Per-capita)  \n.  \nIf  you don\'t like the statistics, construct better ones. Figure out what  factor you want to measure that is not covered in the reports from world  bodies. Construct scientifically accepted surveys. Get to the root of  the problem with logic. Use your stuff between the ears, instead of  passing judgements with hot gas.\n\n3. Under reporting of Rapes:  \n.  \nNow  I knew that you were going to mention this that rapes are under  reported in India and it\'s true, but the matter of fact is that rapes  are under reported everywhere in the world, including USA. More than 70%  of rapes go under reported in USA.  \nSources :  \n[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/rape-study-report-america-us\\_n\\_4310765.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/rape-study-report-america-us_n_4310765.html)  \n[https://cavatus.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/sweden-a-raped-country/](https://cavatus.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/sweden-a-raped-country/)  \n.  \nNow  for the sake of argument, let\'s give you the benefit of doubt and  assume that only 5% of the rapes in India are reported and 95% cases go  unreported. Also assume that 100% of rapes in USA are reported.  \n.  \nBy  that logic, the real rape rate in India will be 0.4 x 20 = 8. Now let  us go further and double that too, we get 8 x 2 = 16, which is still way  less than 27.3 (the rape rate in USA).  \n.  \nTherefore, even if you  multiply the rape rate of India by 40, it still doesn\'t matches USA.  This proves that India is a much safer country for women compared to  USA.  \n.  \nIn cultures across the world, rape carries a stigma.  Because, most of the rapes happen with people who are close to the  woman. Thus, there is a strong social pressure against reporting. This  basic fact is lost on the many who are giving their uneducated comments  on the issue.  \n.\n\n&gt;The  number of recorded rapes in India is certainly a substantial  underestimate, but even if we take five times—or ten times—that figure,  the corrected and enlarged estimates of rapes would still be  substantially lower in India than in the US, the UK, Sweden, or South  Africa (even with the assumption that there is no underreporting in  these other countries).  \n\\-Nobel Laureate, Amartya Sen.\n\n**In summary,**  this is plainly a media distortion where one country reports rapes with  more vigor than an another country. This leads to blind stereotyping  that destroys people\'s lives &amp; careers for no fault of their own.\n\nInstead  of getting into such faulty stereotyping without any statistical  evidence, let us as humans figure out ways we can make world safer for  women. Because, they are getting raped all over the world at an alarming  rate.\n\nYou still believe India has a "rape culture" or that USA is a safe country for women?\n\nHere is a simple choice for those who want to discuss this issue:\n\n* Are you interested in creating solutions for making women safe across race, creed, class and country?\n* Do you want to pick up some news item to justify your own stereotypes about a country?\n\nIf  you belong to the former group, let us constructively engage in a  debate on the solutions. If you belong to the latter group, you are not  the solution, but the problem.\n\nEven more data :\n\n**Rape Data on India**\n\n1. Reported Rapes:  \n.  \nBased on United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) data from 2012:  \n24,923 reported rapes in India, or 4.26 reported rapes for every 1,00,000 women  \nThis places India at 85 out of 121 countries.  \nThis video discusses the above statistics:  \nRapes are over-hyped in India - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdGUPTub-L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdGUPTub-L0)  \nAlso see this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdoeoU48DIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdoeoU48DIg)\n2. Unreported Rapes  \n.  \nBased on a survey conducted by UN Women:  \nIndia reported 8.5 rapes for every 100 women over their lifetimes, based on the answers they gave household-level surveyors.  \nThe  question "if the women had experienced sexual violence at the hands of  an intimate partner or any other person" placed India at 39 out of 99  countries.  \nTen per cent of women in India reported having experienced  sexual violence by their husbands during their lifetime. In the UN  Women database, this places India at 43 out of 86 countries with  comparable data.  \nSource :  \n[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-rape-rhetoric-and-reality/article6705077.ece](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-rape-rhetoric-and-reality/article6705077.ece)\n3. Rape Conviction Rate  \n.  \nAccording  to the Guardian, just 7% of reported rapes in the U.K. resulted in  convictions during 2011-12. In Sweden, the conviction rate is as low as  10%. France had a conviction rate of 25% in 2006.  \nPoor India, a  developing nation with countless challenges, managed an impressive 24.2%  conviction rate in 2012. That’s thanks to the efforts of a lot of good  people — police, lawyers, victims and their families — working  heroically with limited resources.  \nSource :  \n[Why Rape Seems Worse in India Than Everywhere Else (but Actually Isn’t)](http://world.time.com/2013/11/08/why-rape-seems-worse-in-india-than-everywhere-else-but-actually-isnt/)  \nArchive link: [http://web.archive.org/web/20150317034239/http://world.time.com/2013/11/08/why-rape-seems-worse-in-india-than-everywhere-else-but-actually-isnt/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317034239/http://world.time.com/2013/11/08/why-rape-seems-worse-in-india-than-everywhere-else-but-actually-isnt/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI myself (plebman1125) will add some more links which were not in here:\n\n[Is India the R\\*\\*\\* Capital of the world?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb056F2p4wg): Karl Rock\n\n[Is India the rape capital of the world?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dXu9AVWrSg): India in Details\n\n[United States and India: Two of the world\'s worst countries for women? | FACTUAL FEMINIST](https://youtu.be/hc42V3WzAwA?t=167)\n\n[India is not the most dangerous country for women, data shows](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/7PF8NRqgyxoNs2AecfmxVL/India-is-not-the-most-dangerous-country-for-women-data-show.html)\n\n*\\[Full credit to the unknown author who compiled this comment.

Just a person. Not a man or a woman - just an individual, no different than yourselves. Think about this like that.\n\nWhat if this happened to you? Yes, you, an average Indian male. Would you be humiliated? Would you feel helpless? How would you feel when your character is questioned? How would you feel if your entire life is ruined just because you went through a dark street? Would you ever be able to go out again without the crippling fear of being assaulted? Would you ever be able to trust yourself? Will you ever be happy again?\n\nI\'m not trying to say men don\'t experience sexual assault. They most certainly do - and most of them are shamed for it.

It is India\'s 17th largest state and the 21st most populous state.\n\n[The Kalka-Shimla railway in the snow - Courtesy Northern Railway on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/7jgvtg5w3nq51.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bffc58eff46e7c85865a56f26aeccea239eb52)\n\nSo let us get started with some basic facts about the state, courtesy Wikipedia\n\n**Himachal Pradesh (हिमाचल प्रदेश)**\n\nPopulation (2011) \\~ 68.6 lakh\n\nArea \\~ 56000 sq. km\n\nFormed as Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh on 1st November 1956, became state of Himachal Pradesh on 25th January 1971\n\n**Physical Geography:**\n\nThe Himalayas completely dominate the geography of the state with several peaks over 6000 m and a high average elevation. The state has 4 distinct regions. The Shivalik hills are the foothills of the Himalayas which run roughly in the east-west direction. The Lesser Himalayas and the Great Himalayas region are parallel ranges of increasing elevation. The 4th is the Zanskar range, high mountains that separate the valleys of Himachal Pradesh from Tibet.\n\nThere are several glaciers and high passes along the Greater Himalayas and the Zanskar range, with the Rohtang Pass perhaps the most famous of all. The state has a very rich flora, with forests covering 38% of the area.\n\n**Political Geography and Cities**\n\nThe capital and principal city of Himachal Pradesh is Shimla while the other important cities are Dharamshala, Mandi, Kullu, Kangra among others.\n\nThe state is divided into 12 districts. The districts are further divided into 69 subdivisions, 78 blocks and 145 Tehsils.\n\n**Language**\n\nHindi is the official language and the lingua franca of the state. Sanskrit was recently added as a second official language of the state. The majority of Himachalis however speak Pahari as their mother tongue, which is itself a collection of several languages spoken in the region. Other languages are Punjabi, Nepali as well as Tibeto-Burman languages such as Kinnauri, Tibetan, etc.\n\n[Dharamshala cricket stadium in the Himalayas - courtesy Wikimedia](https://preview.redd.it/0jqcjwd14nq51.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ddf6fc0cf5f1d17de115adc9954beb5b3d7eeb5)\n\n**What you can tell us!**\n\n**Major places to visit** \\- National parks, leisure getaways, adventure, pilgrimage\n\n**Important figures from history** \\- Which historical figure (history being defined as anything prior to 1990) has made a huge impact in Himachal Pradesh, India and the world?\n\n**Food** \\- What are some of the best dishes from each region to try out?\n\n**Festivals** \\- The unique celebrations and largest festivals of the state\n\n**Forests and Wildlife** \\- The flora and fauna of the state, the unique plant and animal species that can be found here\n\n**Tribes** \\- Who are the tribal populations living in this area and what lifestyle and historic occupation do they follow.

      <li>Title::: 'Manufacturing.'<br />Body: "I have long had this question in mind. \n\nWhy do we as Indians hope that Western people move their manufacturing industries to India from China? When for instance Apple moved their iPhone production unit to Chennai, from China, it was considered to be a big deal. \n\nNow, I'm not saying that's wrong. It's wonderful that India is a prospective manufacturing source as that would be a boost to our own country's economy. However, why should we manufacture for them and not ourselves?\n\nWhen we do this, the main beneficiary of it are the Americans, not Indians. Just because India would manufacture for the west, it doesn't imply that the prices would ever come down in India. The iPhone would still cost 80000 bucks, far out of the reach of most Indians. \n\nWhy should we as Indians have to beg and plead for Western companies to set up base in India? Why can't we have an India centric model of manufacturing for all essential products such as phones, toothbrushes, soaps, wires, quilts, computers, TV sets etc.? Why do we have to rely on some other country for manufacturing?\n\nIndians making products for Indians and no one else, would be an even greater boost to our economy than manufacturing for some other country. \n\nAmerica's economy grew so much in the 1900s because  they manufactured and built and built endlessly. For themselves. Not for the rest of the world. We should do it too. When we allow Western manufacturing in India, it's like a temporary bandaid for India's ailing economy. Sure, it might boost it in the short run, but not do anything in the long run. \n\nLook at the Chinese. They have turned their entire manufacturing industry into a China centric model, where everything that Chinese citizens use is manufactured by the Chinese, ranging from high intensity weapons, to the most basic products. They don't have to care if any country pulls out their investments from China because they have their own country boosting their economy. \n\nWe should instead make everything for India, by Indians and of the Indians."<br />Author: 'blank_rumal'  id: 'j3ol5x'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j3ol5x/manufacturing/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Its 2nd Oct I am a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Bhagat Singh Ji'<br />Body: 'Followers of these two have always tried to pull down the followers of each other. But I think India needs both the ideologies to function properly.\n\nOne side will simply say we don\'t support the violence.\nThe other side says Gandhi is given the whole credit of fighting for our independence. Because of him India got divided and he could have saved Bhagat Singh Ji. I agree Gandhi could have done better in handelling this particular case.\n\nNow I do subscribe to the idea of Akahnd Bharat and really hope someday we will get there and aware that Gandhi is also accused of favoring one religion over other at the time of partition. Also it is said that he had illicit relations with females, but don\'t know much about it.\n\nIt is said he even changed the song "Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram" and added/modified some of the verses, but isn\'t this the Indian culture that allowed us to have several versions of Ramayan depending on the time, social scenarios and current beliefs, same way he may have tried to create harmony changing the song between the two religions which was the root cause of partition in the first place.\n\nI have no problems(infact support) if pictures of other freedom fighters are used on currency notes.\n\nHad it not been for Gandhi, Indian people would not have come together so easily for any cause such as self employment, cleanliness, equality and also the right to freedom.\n\nNo doubt some of his choices could have been better but after all he too was a human and was bound with the situation at hand at that time. We do not know in what scenarios which decision was taken.\n\nIn the current time people are misusing his name to gain political advantage, but somehow they are ruining his name.\n\nIf Rabindranath Tagore calls him Mahatma, then he must have got something in him. If thousands of people start following his footsteps he must have got something in him.\n\nI may not have much idea about several of the things I said above about him, but one thing is for sure that it doesn\'t stop me to use Ji after his name, so Gandhi Ji.\n\nAs a citizen or followers we should acknowledge his failures and bad choices, nothing can stop for having respect for him.\n\nSome people will say I forgot Lal Bahar Shastri Ji, but no.\n\nSo happy Gandhi Jayanti, happy Shastri Jayanti, happy International Day for Non-violence.'<br />Author: 'NullandRandom'  id: 'j3lwwx'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j3lwwx/its_2nd_oct_i_am_a_follower_of_mahatma_gandhi_and/</li>

Can I use the Talktime without the accompanying mobile data?'<br />Body: "I wanted to know if Jio allows making calls using balance from IUC packs (available under 'Top-up' category in MyJio App) without an activated base plan (available under 'Popular Plans' section). I know I can use the IUC balance to buy Mobile Data boosters in case they get exhausted, but that happens only if there is an activated base plan, of course.\n\nThere was a time before Reliance came up with Jio when we had separate recharge plans for Mobile Data and 'Talktime' as far as all the other Mobile Operators were concerned. However, after the advent of this concept of Daily Data Limit, I don't seem to know any existing Telecom providers which allow this benefit. I have a permanent WiFi at home, which I monthly pay for, and I usually stay at home, which makes the popular Jio Plans virtually a waste of money for me. Is there a workaround you can suggest?

      <li>Title::: 'Sexual Assault in India - Stop asking stupid questions and fixate upon the real problems.'<br />Body: 'When is it right to point out someone’s caste or religion in a sexual assault?\n\nIf there is an effective evidence that caste or religion was a factor in the crime or choice of the victim.\n\nIs it okay to politicize the matter?\n\nFrankly, it’s psychopathic if a political entity tries to take advantage of a sexual assault. Unfortunately this happens a LOT.\n\nIs India unsafe for women?\n\nWith respect to the world, it lands squarely in the middle with respect to safety for women. But, is that enough for our society? - No.\n\nIs their a difference between media coverage of different sexual crimes around the country?\n\nYes. Most of the crimes done in non BJP ruled states and not done by so called Brahamanical castes are largely ignored by local and national media. Why? I don’t know. \nBut, it does create a sense of alienation of a huge proportion of the population, caters to deficit of trust in media reports and fuels controversial theories.\n\nAre anti-sexual assault laws wanting in India?\n\nNo. The laws are pretty draconian, which has led to widespread malpractice and misuse.\n\nWas India safer in general terms as well in terms of sexual assault while UPA was in power?\n\nStatistically speaking - India did much worse in terms of general security under UPA (terrorist attacks, organized crimes, murders, human trafficking, etc. It also did not fare well in terms sexual crimes as well.\n\nSo, is NDA doing better?\n\nIn reference to UPA, yes. But, it is far from any satisfactory level for any part of Indian society.\n\nCan public pressure help on the issue?\n\nNo. Public pressure has shown to actually subvert the judicial process and robust legislative debate.\n\nSo, where does the problem lie?\n\n- Lack of sexual education for the general public.\n- A sexually repressed society which humiliates sexual freedom.\n- Poverty and illiteracy.\n- Deviant religious teachings.\n- Corrupt policing system.\n- Politically motivated public policing.\n\nDoes Hinduism consider (premarital or otherwise) sex, or sexual freedom a sin?\n\nThis a really hard question to answer given the breadth of Hinduism - but, in general, there is no concept, theory or scripture in Hinduism which outlaws or shames sexual expression or freedom.\n\nSo, why does the (largely Hindu) society shame sexual expression?\n\nIlliteracy towards one’s own native culture and philosophy as well as toxic patriarchal customs and anti sexual freedom societal laws picked up during the last 1000 years of foreign rule. Even our judicial system preserves the Judeo-Christian inspired outlook towards sex, nudity, and LGBTQ rights.\n\nDoes Islam/Christianity consider (premarital or otherwise) sex, or sexual freedom a sin?\n\nThe answer requires a bit more nuance, but largely yes, sexual freedom in general is looked down upon and prohibited. \n\nHow does illiteracy and poverty affect the problem?\n\nThey double down on the already present toxic patriarchy in the society as well as the ill formed customs and opinions about sexuality and social structures. The poor is caught in the never ending loop of disinformation and propaganda.\n\nDoes Hinduism allow or encourage sexual assault of women of different castes or religion?\n\nThere no such accepted concept in Hinduism, at all. Even if there was, Hinduism doesn’t have a set of rules or a book or scriptures which are meant to be followed or considered words of ‘God’.\n\nDoes Islam/Christianity allow or encourage sexual assault of women of different religion?\n\nScripturally? Yes.\n\nSo, is there any correlation between Islamic religious extremism and sexual assaults in India?\n\nWe don’t know - the government, since independence, has refused to collect any crime data by religion or even allow any academic study which would investigate the problem. Also, there has been a considerate effort in media and government to play down sexual crimes done by religious minorities - maybe it was done to avoid socio religious tensions - but all it has done is to exacerbate the feeling of exclusion and lack of safety amongst Hindus ( which political parties have happily used to their advantage ).\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nEducate you family, friends and kids. Encourage sexual education and discussion. Accept non mainstream sexual identities and expression. Help in improving the socio-economic conditions of your society.\n\nWhat can the administration do?\n\nStick to the law. Preventive action against religious mobs and fanatics - neutralize or jail them before they riot. Keeping a publicly available sex offender registry. Increased efforts for promulgating actual facts about native Indian morality and philosophy. More funding in sexual crime and trafficking branches. Sensitization of police officials regarding dealing with sex crime victims and de-politicization of the policing system in the county. Sex education for adults. Compulsory sex education in schools.'<br />Author: 'Adept-Cheesecake-812'  id: 'j3h7e5'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j3h7e5/sexual_assault_in_india_stop_asking_stupid/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Why Pakistan fought America's war in Afghanistan?"<br />Body: "There is a  myth that is repeated by Pakistani anchors. If you have seen any Pakistani news debate either on their tv or on youtube (several Pakistani anchors have made youtube channels on which they call popular speakers like Tarek fatah etc which give them Indian views) you must have heard it over and over again. \n\n#The Myth\n\nQamar Cheema said this again in his web show the last time. The myth has it that Pakistan fought America's war in Afghanistan and in this way got used by America. This resulted in Pakistan being a victim of terrorism. Ungrateful America moved on after using Pakistan. \n\n#The Reality\n\nIt was a deal between two parties: Pakistan and America. Like any deal between two corporations or political entities both the parties entered the deal keeping in mind their own gains. \n\nAmerica was to pay, offer weapons, share technology and intelligence with Pakistan in return for fighting their war in Afghanistan. Americans were basically outsourcing their war to someone else. \n\nThey had to pay the price in money, technology and intelligence in return for another nation fighting their war. Pakistan was a neighbour of Afghanistan. Pakistanis were well aware of the battleground, understood culture, language and the place well. They were the most suitable candidate to outsource the war on Afghanistan to. Paying Pakistan to fight on their behalf was a way of lowering the cost in terms of cash and bod count for America. \n\nOn the other hand Pakistan, like anyone to whom something is being outsourced, thought it can do the job for less then the America is paying it for and pocket the rest of the money. \n\nPakistani establishment calculated it would be getting money, weapons, technology, intelligence for doing the job. They would also get two other things of strategic value. Firstly, An opportunity to have greater role in Afghanistan with the blessing of uncle Sam. Secondly, they can use this association with America as a way to have America on their side on international stage. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nPakistan fighting US' was in Afghanistan was a deal made between the two parties and both expected to gain out of it. Pakistan fought US' war in Afghanistan for its own profit."<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'j367bj'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j367bj/why_pakistan_fought_americas_war_in_afghanistan/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hathras victim must get justice, but this choosy action on crimes, even by BJP, must end.'<br />Body: 'After complete radio silence on a series of sexual assault and murder cases which didn’t suit their agenda, the left-liberal ecosystem has once again risen over a case from Hathras, UP.\n\nThe [**facts of the Hathras case**](https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-hathras-gang-rape-case-police/) that have emerged till now – on 14th September, a Dalit girl who had gone to collect fodder from the fields along with her mother was brutally attacked by one Sandeep who strangled her. On the same day, her brother lodged a police complaint under IPS sections 307 (attempt to murder) and ST/SC Act against Sandeep. The girl was referred to Aligarh Medical College in critical condition. Sandeep was arrested by police on the 19th.\n\nOn 22nd, the girl gave a statement to a lady officer naming 3 others and alleging that she was gang-raped. IPC section 376 D (charges for gang-rape) were added to the FIR. All the other accused were arrested by 26 Sept. On 28th, the victim was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where she succumbed the very next day.\n\nThe girl’s body was brought back from Delhi to Hathras on Tuesday night, and early today she was [**cremated by her father**](https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/hathras-gangrape-victim-cremated-by-father-police-presence/) in their native village Boolgarhi in Hathras where the brutal attack took place, at the urging of local administration and police. The family reportedly wanted to wait for more relatives to arrive and conduct the cremation during daytime, but local administration and police feared a law &amp; order problem and insisted for an early cremation.\n\nSuch hush-hush cremations amid tight security are common in sensitive cases, as the administration knows all too well how emotions can run high and be capitalized on by trouble-makers. Even Nirbhaya’s cremation in 2012 was kept secret and conducted in wee hours. But this precautionary act is now being used to whip up [**caste frenzy**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thequint.com%2Fneon%2Fsocial-buzz%2Fhathras-victim-cremated-without-family-consent-up-police-twitter-reacts&amp;psig=AOvVaw2H9iUN586kTZUcjL8jc-1J&amp;ust=1601567907029000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOiw4MafkewCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAZ) by Lutyens’ elites desperate to humiliate all Hindus over this crime.\n\nMedical examination of the victim has found no evidence of rape. These findings and other forensic evidence has now been sent to the forensic science lab in Agra for further examination. Another allegation that has been repeated in [**frenzied reporting**](https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/hathras-nirbhya-part-2-physical-assault-victim-of-hathras-died-in-delhi-was-beaten-in-brutal-way-and-cut-tongue-20808994.html) of this case is that the victim’s tongue was cut off by the perpetrators to ‘prevent her from telling anyone’. However, the police based on medical examination have clarified that the **girl’s tongue was not cut off, but got injured when it came between her teeth as she was strangulated.**\n\nThe one thing that can be said about Hindi-language newspapers like *Dainik Jagran* etc. thus far is that they don’t bury ‘communal/sensitive’ news (aka, attacks on Hindus by minorities) to the same extent that English-language media does.\n\nBut when a case like Hathras gets so much attention, from not just politicians but even international Western media and Bollywood celebrities like [**Akshay Kumar**](https://twitter.com/akshaykumar/status/1310868139148632066), Farhan Akhtar etc., it is hard for even the *Dainik Jagrans* to not get carried away.\n\nSo apart from liberally calling this Nirbhaya-2 and whatnot, headlines about this case now contain the keyword ‘gangrape’, even though the [**inside copy**](https://twitter.com/VikasSaraswat/status/1311155398368346112) of the same article talks about medical examination not finding evidence of rape and warns against sensationalism and politicization in reporting of the case!\n\nSample this [***Dainik Jagran*** **article**](https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/agra-city-forensic-investigation-started-in-agra-lab-of-group-misdeed-with-girl-of-hathras-20810457.html) by journalist Ali Abbas which mentions the words ‘*samuhik dushkarm*‘ (gangrape) 9 times in a short article about the medical evidence in the Hathras case being sent to Forensic Laboratory, Agra. The article neatly avoids telling the reader that initial medical examination found no evidence of rape! Rana Ayyub would be proud of Abbas’ efforts here.\n\nA totally misleading headline in this [***News18 Hindi*** **article**](https://hindi.news18.com/news/delhi-ncr/safdarjung-hospital-report-in-hathras-case-confirmed-the-allegations-of-the-victim-family-up-police-aligarh-dlnh-3274895.html) claims that “Safdaurjung hospital’s report confirms victim family’s accusations in Hathras case”, giving the impression to the reader that gang-rape was confirmed by the Delhi hospital. But the actual content of the article says no such thing – it reports a statement by Safdarjung Hospital’s media spokesperson Poonam Dhanda that the “victim died due to wounds in the neck and spinal column. Infection had spread in the body, her limbs had stopped functioning and she was taken for neuro-surgery but died the next day”. Using the spread of infection in the body as absolute proof about poor treatment, the article goes on to claim that this proves the victim’s family’s allegations.\n\nBut even this bias and shameless sensationalism in covering the Hathras incident is not enough for Left-wing propaganda outlet *NewsLaundry* which [**claims**](https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/09/30/hathras-ani-missing-in-action-dainik-jagran-toi-lucknow-underplay-assaulted-dalit-girls-death) media is ‘underplaying’ the case.\n\nOne simple way to judge whether an incident is being politicized and could be spun to further anti-Hindu agenda is whether Western media is awakened or not. The Hathras case easily passes that test.\n\nNote the generous mention of pet bootlickers of Western media when it comes to any reporting about Bharat – ‘Dalits, discrimination, frequency of rape’. But will you see an NYT or BBC story on a rape incident in US mention at the outset that USA sees over 275 [**reported rapes**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/191137/reported-forcible-rape-cases-in-the-usa-since-1990/) every day (for a country which has 1/4th the population of Bharat)?\n\nThat police in Bharat is poorly trained and equipped is an established fact. Police reform is a long-pending item, just like reform of other institutions like bureaucracy and judiciary. There is every chance that police did not show the required empathy to the Hathras victim’s family, that they were slow in taking action – ordinary Hindus, of all backgrounds, fail to get prompt response from police. We are currently witnessing how a series of attacks and arson in temples is being waved off by the Andhra Pradesh Government and ignored by large sections of national Mainstream media, whereas a broken church window in Delhi 2015 was enough to activate the country’s Home Minister and made international news.\n\nIt is also clear that the Hathras victim was brutally attacked and left for dead. What drove her attacker(s) will only be established after investigation by an SIT which has been set up by the UP CM, although one accused’s family has claimed that an [**old family feud**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/family-feud-behind-hathras-case-one-accused-jailed-in-2001-for-attacking-gangrape-victim-s-grandfather-1727039-2020-09-30) lies behind the case. The Mother of one of the accused has claimed that the victim’s grandfather had framed two of the accused on a false SC/ST Act case two decades back.\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, or SC/ST Act as it is commonly known, is a strict law drafted to protect under-privileged sections of society which has provisions of immediate arrest and non-anticipatory bail. But like all other social justice laws in Bharat like **reservations quota**, this too has seen fair [**share of misuse**](https://falanadikhana.com/dalits-attacked-on-yadav-family-for-a-trivial-reason-in-bihar/) due to incitement by vested interests.\n\nAnd if you are thinking that such outrage by media and celebrities is for the greater good as it at least brings attention to our law &amp; order issues, take a look at a sample of cases which this same lobby has turned a blind eye to, and which only ‘communal’ outlets like OpIndia and others have been **reporting and tracking** –\n\n**1.)** [**27 September, Badaun:**](https://breakingtube.com/up-news/badaun-love-jihad-muslim-man-trap-dalit-girl-by-changing-name-and-killed/) An already married Muslim youth Asif assumed a fake Hindu identity to lure a Dalit girl Neha into a relationship and married her. Once Neha found his true identity and confronted him, he first raped her and then shot her dead.\n\n**2.)** **23 September, Sonbhadra:** Priya Soni was beheaded by her husband Ajaz Ahmed whom she had married just couple of months ago under the Special Marriage Act, after she refused to convert to Islam.\n\n3.) **28 Aug, Lakhimpur Kheri:** Tailor Mohammed Dilshad raped and murdered a Dalit girl who had stepped out from home to fill an online scholarship form for Class XII exams.\n\n4.) **3 March 2018, Chatra**: \xa0Three brothers Saddam, Shahid and Ishrar Alam, gang-raped and then poured kerosene on a 15-year-old Hindu girl and burnt her alive. Police failed to arrange an ambulance and the girl died while being taken to hospital in a private vehicle.\n\n5.) [**22 Nov 2019, Sambhal**](https://www.livehindustan.com/uttar-pradesh/story-sambhal-rape-case-minor-victim-who-burnt-alive-after-rape-died-in-delhi-hospital-today-2875618.html): A minor girl was raped by neighbour Zeeshan, and when the girl’s mother protested Zeeshan returned and set the girl on fire. She was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi but passed away, just like the Hathras victim did. The only difference – there was no activist crowd outside the hospital demanding justice for the Sambhal victim, no media teams descending to her native village to interview her family, no secular politicians demanding justice.\n\nThe list of such cases are endless. You can refer to *Swarajya* journalist Swati Goel Sharma’s twitter [**timeline**](https://twitter.com/swati_gs).\n\nBut the net result of this selective reporting and outrage by media-activist-celebrity cabal is that all governments, BJP ones included, now have a two-tier system for dispensing ‘justice’ – discrimination among victims based on the kind of coverage their case gets has become the norm. Instead of treating all citizens equally, we have now created a system wherein certain victims are given preferential treatment.\n\nPM Modi called UP CM Yogi Adityanath and directed strict action against culprits. It [**did not go amiss on social media**](https://twitter.com/Si_lv_er/status/1311184701470638081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1311184701470638081%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindupost.in%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php) that no such calls were made even for countless cases of crimes against Hindus, such as the Palghar sadhu lynching. But then again, maybe this is the price we pay for a fragmented multi-party democracy where our elites have promoted an ‘Idea of India’ that places groups of Hindus against each other and exalts minorities. PM Modi and CM Yogi are all too aware of the [**political vultures**](https://twitter.com/saffron_yoda/status/1311189618847481857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1311189618847481857%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindupost.in%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php) flying above, and the group of Breaking India forces who support such politics.\n\nIt has emerged that the Hathras victim’s family will get Rs 25 lakh, a house, govt. job for one member as [**compensation**](https://twitter.com/Interceptors/status/1311288730628448257), while a 3-member SIT led by UP Home Secretary will submit its probe report in 7 days and the accused will be tried in a fast-track court. But the old, jobless parents of [**Naina Kaur**](https://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1311293483647340544) murdered by her stalker Sheru Khan in front of their eyes got zero compensation; family of Dalit man [**Loten Nishad**](https://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1311298922699251712) shot dead by a Tablighi Jamaat supporter did not did get the full Rs. 5 lakh promised to them, and neither was NSA (National Security Act) invoked against the two accused who are already out on bail.\n\nMore than anything else right now, Bharat needs bureaucratic, police, judicial and political/legal reforms. Our State suffers from a deep-rooted self-alienation due to which it remains unconcerned to the needs and aspirations of the majority citizens, and instead panders in a reactive, pitiful manner to agendas set by our colonised elite and their Western partners.\n\nThe Hathras victim must get justice, but so must the hundreds of other Hindus who die painful, forgettable deaths.'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'j31t30'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j31t30/hathras_victim_must_get_justice_but_this_choosy/</li>

When it happened, I remember that an Indian-American friend told me that there was a lot of upheaval about it and that it was causing significant economic damage. Did that resolve itself? Did the government backtrack? If not, how was that dealt with?\n\nSecond, I\'m curious about the overall state of the Indian economy before the coronavirus. I know that there\'s still a lot of poverty in the country at large, but I can never get a clear picture of what\'s going well, which regions are prospering, which aren\'t, and what can be done to fix it. Could somebody give me a quick run-down?\n\nFinally, I keep hearing about the "License Raj", usually described as being an over-bureaucratization of India\'s corporate sphere that makes it hard to start new businesses and a big enabler of low-level and mid-level corruption.

      <li>Title::: 'Looking at what is happening, Police Reform is the need of the hour.'<br />Body: "There are countless examples of Congress leaders misusing/bribing the Police for arresting opposition, fake cases, cover-ups, illegal things the list goes on. But it is useless now to say how rotten Congress is. I want to talk about what is happening today...\n\nWhat happened in UP is absolutely tragic. A woman was raped(conflicted news on this) and later succumbed to death. And the cops did everything to help the accused and derail the case(locking up the family, burning the body, claiming no proof of rape etc). The accused is a Thakur in this case, and he's not the only one. \n\nThere is a 'Thakur' in almost every village and town. He is relatively rich, has a criminal background, and is influential. In any case, when things go bad for Thakur, the police will come to his rescue because they don't want the 'gifts' to stop coming.\n\n‘Thakur’ regularly intimidates/extracts money/harasses anyone as he wishes. Everyone in the town/village is a mute spectator to Thakur's activities because they know they won't be safe otherwise. \n\nOnce in a while, one Thakur will do something utterly heinous and there will be a public outcry, media attention, and Thakur gets jailed. \n\nThe other thousands of Thakurs in the country will live on, they won't face any consequences. The regular person is always scared of them and the corrupt police will always side with the Thakur. \n\nIn 2017, when the Unnao rape happened - the victim was fighting everyone - firstly the police(filed multiple cases against the family members), then the thugs who were supported by the police(victim's father was beaten up who later died in custody, victim's car being hit by a truck), and to some extent, the govt of UP (the victim had to threaten immolation in front of the CM's house because the police were taking no action) \n\nParties have an incentive to latch on to leaders like these even with criminal background just because they are powerful and are capable of winning. In this case, the accused was a four-term MLA and it took two years for BJP to expel him finally. \n\nThere is very little we can do to stop criminals from being elected by buying votes. What can be done, is to make it possible to hold the police responsible. We can transform the country just by making police accountable for their sins. If the police are just, politicians won't be actively engaged in crime knowing they can't buy the cops. If the police are just, political parties won't give tickets to criminals knowing they might end up in jail. If the police are just, no one has to fear opening a business even if it clashes with local leader’s interests. I really believe police reform will boost us morally, economically, and most importantly - make the country safer for you and me. \n\nIn both Unnao and Hathras cases, the police would have dragged and stretched until the victims are worn out and help the accused. It is only because of the media attention, the then MLA got convicted and today Hathras case is being taken seriously. For justice to happen, we can’t rely on media attention every time. There are thousands of helpless rape victims who have little hope for justice. It has to be Police who should act responsibly and be the pillar of justice without any external influence. The Police should be reformed to make them accountable when fail to do this.\n\nBJP has promised Police Reform in the past. There has been no talk about it until now and we don't know when or if they will do anything about it. It is obvious that no party wants to lose control over the police for many reasons. But I still have little hope, that it might happen sometime in the future. And it has to be BJP implementing it in their states, the Congress will never do it. Until this happens, police will be corrupt, parties will continue to be in bed with criminals and it's the people who will suffer.\n\nWould I be wrong to assume that Police Reform can bring a drastic change? If so, how can we push the government to make this happen?"<br />Author: '_4_the_mare'  id: 'j2n893'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j2n893/looking_at_what_is_happening_police_reform_is_the/</li>

Is this not an example of kicking a man when he is down. \n\nIf you are confident in your ideas your philosophy and your culture, exist continue your practices and the internet will do its magic. You will get more people like me, who will see the beauty of Hinduism weigh it up against his/her own beliefs and the internal conflict will begin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen i see hatred like that espoused in this sub it  invokes emotions that are similar to pride/ anger /nationalism/ protectionism. Whilst i have left islam I still have a Muslim family i love, a community i love and grew  up with. They are normal people living normal hypocritical  lives and i feel like this hatred makes life harder for them , it makes them more isolated from the mainstream of society.\n\nThe chance they will be able to see secular ideology or Hindu philosophy from an objective lens decreases, the more these reactionary protectionist emotions are cultivated within our culture/community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a young man i cannot help but feel these emotions because i feel it is my duty to protect my family and friends and living as a minority in a western country i feel this obligation hangs over me heavy.\n\nSo yea TLDR: why the hatred for your  fellow subcontinental Muslims their ancestors were probably the biggest victims of Islamic conquest, the hatred pushes away young men especially from secularism and seeing religions objectively and closer towards their religious communities making them paranoid and more fundamentalist.'<br />Author: 'Deityofreshpunani'  id: 'j2lgmx'<br />Score:39<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j2lgmx/views_on_subcontinental_muslims/</li>

But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, who is also known as Yajña. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-īśvara-vādī, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self-everything-is sacrificed for Kṛṣṇa.

I know this is very offensive , but I think due to generation of segregation different caste groups have developed sub cultures of their own and we need to address the disturbing elements of it ."<br />Author: 'otakuu2'  id: 'j2haol'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j2haol/what_is_wrong_with_up/</li>

I've been trying to understand its nuances from the limited information on the web. \n\nFrom what I understood, the Farm bills aim to allow farmers to engage in agri contracts outside of the state mandis and APMC (in highliy simplified terms). The opposition's main point is that this will lead to corporates monopolising the market and make the farmers more vulnerable. However, no where do the bills say that they have to engage in such contracts. If they wish they can continue selling their produce to mandis. Is my understanding correct? If so, what is the issue then? Are there really no safeguards outside of this for farmers? \n\nAdditionally, there has been a lot of talk about removal or cereals and a lot of others from the Essential Commodities list and removing stockholding limits and that this would lead to hoarding by corporates. How does that work? Can someone explain?\n\nTo me, these bills and what they're trying to achieve made a lot of sense, so, I dont understand these protests. Is this just opposition  trying to make a hue and cry over nothing? \n\nAny explanation would be appreciated. Please be unbiased.

Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where ignorance is bliss.  \n    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people  around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot more difficult to achieve than expected. \n\n(MAL)\n\n---\n\n**Show Information**\n\n*  **The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.**\n\n[AniList](https://anilist.co/anime/21804/Saiki-Kusuo-no-nan) | [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33255/Saiki_Kusuo_no_%CE%A8-nan) | [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18401)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. 02**\n\n[AniList](https://anilist.co/anime/98034/Saiki-Kusuo-no-nan-2/) | [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34612/Saiki_Kusuo_no_%CE%A8-nan_2) | [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=20177)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.

There are various activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Kṛṣṇa consciousness as set forth here in the Gītā. This process is generally known as yajña, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. The more the activities of the material world are performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or for Viṣṇu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (māyā) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by Kṛṣṇa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are-all combined together-Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by māyā is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is said to be in samādhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajña, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain-everything-becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : What is brahmajyoti ? How can an illusioned living entity unveil it ?**  \n.  \n**Question 2 : How the material atmosphere can be spiritualized ?**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5n5my4wtf1q51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8080021a0fd4b67f9feee4d724e67176772c1131\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'j1uhwo'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j1uhwo/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is424/</li>

It is not a problem with one solution, but a combination of many. I have listed some which I could think of, and not sure if any of them are already in place (at least on paper). If anyone is interested, please add your own opinion/\n\n**Policy/Infra -**\n\n1. A Road standard guide line - What qualifies a National Highway, a State Highway all the way down to a street, based on number of lanes, width etc. This must also set a standard for urban roads, with cycle/pedestrian lanes, ensuring safety.\n2. A national road laying / topping guideline - How a specific road must be laid/re-laid based on urban/rural locations, traffic quantity/type etc.. This should include process to be followed all the way from how to re-lay the roads, like removing the old black top, determine when to move to concrete top, to how a utility work must be done &amp; follow up repairs.\n3. Policy to streamline the construction of multi agency Railway &amp; other bridges. Right now, when a Railway over bridge is constructed, Railways constructs the portion above tracks, while the State/National HD builds the other sides, depending on the other section. This causes huge delays due to lack of co-ordination.\n4. Modernizing traffic policing, signal, CCTV &amp; other urban infrastructure.\n5. Introducing CSR activities like road cleaning, minor construction works as punishments for first time/minor Driving related offences (in addition to fines). Sometime lost Time can have more value than the money spent. Also, Driver license period reduction should be considered for repeat offenders.\n6. Promote multiple modes of public transport to take as much people away from Roads as possible.\n\n**Driver Training-**\n\n1. Modernize the RTOs in India with more contractors in Front end, to reduce bribing/red tapism involved. Linking Aadhaar must be considered, though it will face opposition.\n2. Stricter Driver license tests, with mandatory classes for first time licenses.\n3. Driving ethics taught in schools as mandatory subjects. Many in India do not know even how to overtake, plus literally Zero lane discipline.\n4. Reduce Public transport drivers' working hours (reduce their work load), and ensure those drivers first know road rules &amp; driving ethics. After this, public transport bus drivers must be made more accountable for any accidents. Installing Dash cams/CCTVs in all buses to ensure Good drivers do not get punished.\n\n**Common current problems -**\n\n* Bad Drivers. \n* Bad infrastructure. I've been nearly killed multiple times by pot holes &amp; man holes which jut out for 10 inches over the road surface, than by reckless drivers.\n* Lax implementation - States' co-operation on implementation of stricter laws. States believe stricter implementation of MVAA will lead to them loosing votes. Loosing lives is easier for parties than to loose votes. Forcing Govt to back track safety, to gain votes is opposition's strategy.. What a shame ?\n* Even city roads lack standards. I'm from Chennai &amp; I can think of multiple main roads, which reduce from 3 lanes each way to 1 lane each way, and then back to 3 lanes. This kind of stupid road design cause multiple fatal accidents.\n* Infrastructure is always catching up - The road infrastructure is always few years to decades behind the demand, and it never seems to catch up. Even small repair work taking months to years to complete.\n* No care about pedestrians' / cyclists' safety- Rarely Govt lays quality pedestrian platforms, but they get encroached as parking, or by hawkers. We the public always feel bad when a hawker is evicted, but we never empathize with someone who got killed or injured because of lack of safe walkway.\n* Rampant Drunk driving - In Chennai we can find TASMAC Bar parking area filled with 2 wheelers. Does everyone bring a designated driver with them? Hell no. govt promotes drunk driving at the expense of public lives. This will loop back to harsher punishments, which again most State govts fail to implement.\n\nThis might be a long rant, but I hope to see a lively conversation.\n\nThanks."<br />Author: 'RealityCheck18'  id: 'j1tdfh'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j1tdfh/how_to_reduce_road_accidents_fatalities_in_india/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Deep Learning &amp; How It's Work - Every Thing You Should Know"<br />Body: " \n\n## What is Deep Learning\n\nDeep Learning is a machine learning technique that constructs artificial neural networks to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. In practice, deep learning, also called deep structured learning or hierarchical learning, uses a huge number of hidden layers -typically more than 6 but often much higher - of nonlinear processing to extract features from data and transform the data into different levels of abstraction (representations).  \nAs an example, assume the input data is a matrix of pixels. the first layer typically abstracts the pixels and recognizes the edges of features in the image. The next layer might build simple features from the edges like leaves and branches. The subsequent layer could then recognize a tree and so on. The data passing from one layer to the next is considered a transformation, turning the output of 1 layer into the input for the next. Each layer corresponds with a unique level of abstraction and the machine can learn which features of the data to place in which layer/level on its own. Deep learning is differentiated from traditional “shallow learning” because it learns much deeper levels of hierarchical abstraction and representations.\n\n## Evolution of Deep Learning\n\nIt’s the most valuable development in the world of AI in the present time. But rather than trying to understand the details of the field which could lengthen this article a little too much. Let’s just take a look at some of the main developments in the evolution of deep learning.\n\nAlthough the study of the human brain is thousands of years old. the first step towards neural networks took place in 1943.\n\n### In 1943\n\nWhen Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and a young mathematician, Walter Pitts, wrote a paper on how neurons might work. They modeled an easy neural network with electrical circuits.\n\n### In 1958\n\nFrank Rosenblatt creates the perceptron, an algorithm for pattern recognition based on a two-layer computer neural network using simple addition and subtraction. The perceptron computes a weighted sum of the inputs, subtracts a threshold, and passes one of two possible values out as the result.\n\n### In 1980\n\nKunihiko Fukushima proposes the Neocognitron which is a hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural network. It's been used for handwriting recognition and other pattern recognition problems.\n\n### In the 1980s-1990s\n\nJohn Hopfield presented a paper to the National Academy of Sciences. His approach to making useful devices.  \nJoint Conference on Cooperative/ Competitive Neural Networks at which Japan announced their Fifth-Generation effort resulted in the US worrying about being left behind. Soon funding was flowing once again.  \nDeep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986.  \nYann LeCun’s invented the machine that could read handwritten digits. This invention felled beneath the wider world’s radar. While the algorithm worked and it required training for 3 days.  \nThis time when the second AI winter kicked in, which also effected research for neural networks and Deep Learning. Various overly-optimistic individuals had exaggerated the “immediate” potential of AI, breaking expectations, and angering investors. Luckily, some people continued to figure on AI and DL, and some significant advances were made. In 1995, Dana Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik developed the support vector machine.  \nSepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber publish a milestone paper on “Long Short-Term Memory” (LSTM). It’s a kind of RNN architecture that will persist to revolutionize deep learning in decades to come.\n\n### In 2006\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero, and the altogether published the paper a fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets. in which they stacked multiple databases together in layers and called them Deep Belief Networks. The training process is much more efficient for a large amount of data.\n\n### In 2008\n\nAndrew NG’s group at Stanford started advocating for the utilization of GPUs. So, that they can train Deep Neural Networks to hurry up the training time by many folds. this could bring practicality in the field of Deep Learning for training on a large volume of data efficiently.\n\n### In 2009\n\nFinding enough labeled data has always been a challenge for the Deep Learning community. In 2009 Fei-Fei Li, an AI professor at Stanford launched ImageNet, assembled a free database of more than 14 million labeled images. it would serve as a benchmark for the deep learning researchers who would participate in ImageNet competitions (ILSVRC) each year.\n\n### In 2012\n\nAlexNet, a GPU implemented the CNN model designed by Alex Krizhevsky. AlexNet won Imagenet’s image classification contest with an accuracy of 84%. It's a huge jump over 75% accuracy that earlier models had achieved. This win triggers a new deep learning boom globally.\n\n### In 2014\n\nIan Goodfellow created GAN also known as Generative Adversarial Neural Network. GANs open an entirely new door of application of deep learning in fashion, art, science, etc.\n\n### In 2016\n\nDeepmind’s deep reinforcement learning model beats the human champion in the complex game of Go. the game is much more complex than chess. As a result, this feat captures the imagination of everyone. Also, it takes the promise of deep learning to an entirely new level. Self-learning computer eclipses human ability at complex game Go In 2019  \nYoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun won Turing Award 2018. they had immensely contributed to advancements in the area of deep learning and AI. This was a defining moment for those who had worked relentlessly on neural networks.2018 Turing Award\n\nBy 2012, deep learning had already been used to help people turn left at Albuquerque (Google Street View). It inquired about the estimated average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow (Apple’s Siri). In June of the year 2012, Google linked 16,000 computer processors, gave them Internet access, and watched as the machines taught themselves how to identify…cats. What may seem laughably simplistic, though, was quite earth-shattering as scientific progress goes.\n\n## Advantages of Deep Learning\n\nThe following are the benefits or advantages of Deep Learning:\n\n**➾**\xa0\xa0Features are automatically deduced and optimally tuned for the desired outcome. Features are not required to be extracted ahead of time. This avoids time-consuming machine learning techniques.  \n**➾**\xa0\xa0Robustness to natural variations in the data is automatically learned.  \n**➾**\xa0\xa0The same neural network-based approach can be applied to many different applications and data types.  \n**➾**\xa0 Massive parallel computations can be performed using GPUs and are scalable for large volumes of data. Moreover, it delivers better performance results when the amount of data are huge.  \n**➾**\xa0\xa0The deep learning architecture is flexible to be adapted to new problems in the future.\n\n## Disadvantages of Deep Learning\n\nThe following are the drawbacks or disadvantages of Deep Learning:\n\n**➾**\xa0It requires a very large amount of data to perform better than other techniques.  \n**➾**\xa0It is extremely expensive to train due to complex data models. Moreover, deep learning requires expensive GPUs and hundreds of machines. This increases the cost to the users.  \n**➾**\xa0There is no standard theory to guide you in selecting the right deep learning tools as it requires knowledge of topology, training method, and other parameters. As a result, it is difficult to be adopted by less skilled people.  \n**➾**\xa0It is not easy to comprehend output based on mere learning and requires classifiers to do so. Convolutional neural network-based algorithms perform such tasks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf You Find Something Interesting Then Read The Full Article - [Deep Learning](https://www.geeky4tech.com/2020/09/deep-learning.html)"<br />Author: 'Geeky_4_Tech'  id: 'j1rctm'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j1rctm/deep_learning_how_its_work_every_thing_you_should/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Away from left cacophony using Veer Bhagat Singh to berate "bhakths", a few of his quotes dropped out by MSM. "Muslims lack a great deal of Indianness", Romanticizes Savarkar as "Coming in the wave of world-love, he used to stop walking on grass thinking the soft grass would be mowed under the feet"'<br />Body: '&gt;In 1926, Bhagat Singh wrote an article for the Punjabi Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. He says, "... Muslims lack a great deal of Indianness, so they do not understand the importance of Indianness in all India, and prefer the Arabic script and the Persian language. The importance of being one language of all India and that too Hindi, they never understand, so they keep on praising their Urdu and sit on one side." \n\n&gt;Later in the same article, Bhagat Singh says," We want the Muslim brothers too to observe their faith but become Indian in the same way as Kamaal Turks are. This only will save India. We should look at the questions of language etc. from a very large point of view, not by making it poignant (religious) problems.\n\n&gt;In the entire 750-pages of his writings, even as Veer Bhagat criticized those killing Muslims in riots, he has never once criticized Savarkar or his Hindutva. Instead Veer Bhagat says:\n\n\n&gt; "World-lover is the hero whom we do not hesitate a little to call a fierce insurgent, staunch anarchist - the same heroic Savarkar. Coming in the wave of world-love, he used to stop walking on the grass thinking that the soft grass would be mowed under the feet." \n \n&gt;The above quote about Savarkar is from the martyr Sardar Bhagat Singh! Bhagat Singh Ji\'s article titled "Vishwa Prem" has been published twice in the issue of "Matwala" on 15th and 22nd November, 1926.\n\n\nAnother instance of Veer Bhagat Singh promoting Veer Savarkar, the main promoted as the main villain of India today by Congress &amp; leftists:\n\n&gt;Then in March 1926, while writing about Madanlal Dhingra and Savarkar in Kirti, Bhagat Singh says - [2]\n \n&gt;"The impact of the Swadeshi movement reached England as well and Mr. Savarkar opened a house called \'Indian House\'. Madanlal also became its member. .... One day, Mr. Savarkar and Madanlal Dhingra were talking for a long time. In a test of daring to give up his life, Savarkar pierced a big needle inn his hand by asking Madanlal to lay his hands on the ground, but Punjabi Veer did not even say ah. Tears filled the eyes of both. The two hugged each other. Ouch, how beautiful that time was. How invaluable and indelible that teardrop was! How beautiful that match was ! so glorious! What should we know about that emotion, what cowardly people who are afraid of even the thought of death, know how high, how holy and how revered are those who die for the sake of the nation!\n \n&gt;From the next day, Dhingra did not go to the Indian House of Savarkar and attended the Indian students\' meeting organized by Sir Col. Wylie. Seeing this, the boys of the Indian house got very agitated and started calling him traitors, even traitor, but their anger was reduced by Savarkar saying that after all he had tried to even break his head to run our house. And due to his hard work, our movemet is going on, so we should thank him! Well, some days passed quietly.\n \n&gt;On July 1, 1909, there was a meeting at the Jahangir Hall of the Imperial Institute. Sir Curzon Wylie also went there. He was talking to two other people that Dhingra suddenly pulled out a pistol.He was put to sleep forever. Then after some struggle dhingra was caught. What to say after that, there was a worldwide cry!. Everyone started abusing dhingra wholeheartedly. His father sent a telegram from Punjab and said that I refuse to accept such rebel, rebellious and murderous man as my son. The Indians held large meetings. There were big speeches. Big proposals moved. All in blasphemy. But even at that time Savarkar was the hero who favored him openly. At first, he offered an excuse for not letting the motion pass against him that he is still on trial and we cannot call him guilty. Finally, when the vote was taken on this proposal, the Speaker of the House, Mr. Bipinchandra Pal, was saying that if it is deemed to be unanimously passed by everyone, then Savarkar Sahib stood up and started the lecture. Just then, an Englishman punched him in the mouth and said, "Look, how straight the English fist goes!" A Hindustani young man put a stick on the head of the Englishman, and said, "See, how straight the Indian club goes!" There was a noise. The meeting was left in between. The proposal remained unpassed. Well! "\n\nIf Bhagat Singh criticized communal riots, communal propaganda and promoted class consciousness, money to the common people as end as means to end communalism, he also specified quotes of Hindu Padshahi, a "Hindutva" book by "Hindutva villain" Savarkar as his inspiration in his last days in jail. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Aabhas24/status/1247163368852475905\n\n&gt;It includes only seven Indian authors, but only one of them is Savarkar whose more than one quotes have been included by Bhagat Singh in his diary. And all the six out of six quotes are from the same book, Hindupadapada Shahi. They are as follows: [7]\n \n&gt;1) Sacrifice was adorable only when it was directly or remotely but reasonably felt to be indispensable for success. But the sacrifice that does not ultimately lead to success is suicidal and therefore had no place in the tactics of Maratha warfare (Hindupadapada Shahi, Page 256).\n \n&gt;2) Fighting the Marathas is like fighting with the wind, is to strike on the water. [Hindupadapadshahi, 254]\n \n&gt;3) that remains the despair of our age which has to write history without making it, to sing of valorous deeds without the daring abilities and opportunities without actualising them in life [Hindupadapada Shahi, 245–4]\n \n&gt;4) Political slavery can be easily overthrown at any time. But it is difficult to break the shackles of cultural domination. [Hindupadpadshahi, 242-43]\n \n5) No freedom!, whose smile we shall never resign. Go tell our invaders, the Danes, "That\'t sweeter to blood for an &gt;age at thy shrine. Than to sleep but a minute in chains!", Quoted by Savarkar, the lines of Thomas Moore (Hindupadapada Shahi, 219)\n \n&gt;6) "Rather get killed than converted", This was the prevalent call among Hindus at that time. But Ramdas stood up and exclaimed!, "No, not thus. Get killed rather than converted is good enough but better than that. Do not get either killed nor get violently converted. Rather, Kill the violent forces themselves and get killed while killing to conquer in the cause of righteousness." (Hindupadapada Shahi p.141-62) [8]\n\nEnding with Veer Savarkar\'s words about Veer Bhagat Singh:\n \n&gt;Ha, Bhagat Singh, hi ha!\n&gt;You galloped on the gallows, oh hai for us!\n&gt;Rajguru, you ha!\n&gt;Veer Kumar, martyr in National warfare\n&gt;Hi ha! Jai Jai Ha!\n&gt;This ah of today will win tomorrow\n&gt;Royal crown will come home\n&gt;Wore you crown of death before that.\n&gt;We will take arms in our hands\n&gt;The ones with you were killing the enemy!\n&gt;Who is a sinner?\n&gt;Who does not worship the unmatched sanctity of your intentions\n&gt;Go, martyr!\n&gt;We take oath with testimony.\n&gt;the fight with arms is explosive,\n&gt;We are remaining behind you\n&gt;Will fight and win freedom!!\n&gt;Hi Bhagat Singh, Hi Ha!

      <li>Title::: 'Bhagat Singh and Communism'<br />Body: 'Singh  was attracted to anarchism and communism.\\[1\\] He was an avid reader of  the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin  and Leon Trotsky.\\[2\\]  In his last testament, "To Young Political  Workers", he declares his  ideal as the "Social reconstruction on new,  i.e., Marxist, basis".\\[3\\] Singh did not believe in the Gandhian   ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent   resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of   exploiters with another.\\[4\\]\n\nFrom May to September 1928, Singh published a series of articles on anarchism in *Kirti*.  He was concerned that the public misunderstood the concept of  anarchism, writing that:\n\n&gt;"The  people are scared of the word anarchism.  The word anarchism has been  abused so much that even in India  revolutionaries have been called  anarchist to make them unpopular." He  clarified that anarchism refers  to the absence of a ruler and abolition  of the state, not the absence  of order. He went on to say: "I think in  India the idea of universal  brotherhood, the Sanskrit sentence ***vasudhaiva kutumbakam*** etc., has the same meaning."\n\nHe believed that:\n\n&gt;The   ultimate goal of Anarchism is complete independence, according to  which  no one will be obsessed with God or religion, nor will anybody be  crazy  for money or other worldly desires. There will be no chains on  the body  or control by the state. This means that they want to  eliminate: the  Church, God and Religion; the state; Private  property.\\[1\\]\n\nHistorian  K. N. Panikkar described Singh as one of the early Marxists in  India.\\[4\\] The political theorist Jason Adams notes that he was more  enamoured with Lenin than with Marx.\\[2\\]  From 1926 onward, he studied  the history of the revolutionary movements  in India and abroad. In his  prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in  reference to imperialism and  capitalism and also the revolutionary  thoughts of Trotsky.\\[5\\]  When  asked what his last wish was, Singh replied that he was studying  the  life of Lenin and he wanted to finish it before his death. In spite of  his belief in Marxist ideals however, Singh never joined the Communist  Party of India.\\[2\\]\n\nReferences:\n\n\\[1\\] Rao, Niraja (April 1997), ["Bhagat Singh and the Revolutionary Movement"](https://web.archive.org/web/20151001141654/http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv3n1/bsingh.htm), *Revolutionary Democracy*, **3** (1), archived from [the original](http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv3n1/bsingh.htm) on 1 October 2015, retrieved 18 November 2011\n\n\\[2\\] Adams, Jason (2005), [*Asian Anarchism: China, Korea, Japan &amp; India*](https://web.archive.org/web/20151001143403/http://raforum.info/article.php3?id_article=3225&amp;lang=en), Raforum.info, archived from [the original](http://raforum.info/article.php3?id_article=3225&amp;lang=en) on 1 October 2015, retrieved 28 October 2011\n\n\\[3\\]Singh, Bhagat.

      <li>Title::: 'The benefits of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra'<br />Body: ' **Spirituality:-**\n\nBy chanting the mantra, one can get hold of their mind. We are all slaves to desires, appetites, and the pool of whimsical thoughts that our minds can meander into. But as Bhagavad Gita says, “One must conquer the mind. Those who have, their mind is the best of friends. Those who haven’t, their mind will be the greatest enemy.” Chanting Hare Krishna can help one get that peace of mind. \n\n **The most important benefit of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra is to find God-realization and pure love of God.** \n\n The name of Krishna is revived in our heart, which has been missing since the start of Kali Yuga. One must understand that before the soul enters the material world, it has a unique, special relationship with God, and the strength of the relationship is way stronger than what it is like with the material body. When one chants the mantra, one starts to redevelop and strengthen this relationship with God. \n\n[hare krishna mantra benefits](https://www.hamarivirasat.com/hare-krishna-mantra-benefits-chanting-hare-krishna/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ize4x5jgxtp51.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04dd7eeadf9cd13bfe691d657a3ba43e5a55d03d'<br />Author: 'spiritual_touch'  id: 'j16tbo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j16tbo/the_benefits_of_chanting_the_hare_krishna_mantra/</li>

Almost 90% of the crowd working in this field is half baked, and though they charge a good amount they never use automation or power tools to make their job easier and just use manual tools and waste time. Over and above everyone wants to be a "contractor" and just sublet the work to the lowest skilled guy in their team. I once called an agency to install clothes drying racks at home and that owner was just like a contractor telling his regular Staff what to do, it would be more appreciable if that guy could just come in workmanship clothes and finish the work at earliest. There is a huge gap between theory learned people and the ones who do practical work. They dont get together and work. I have had numerous arguments with handymen who just use only one big drill bit and want to drill big holes for even a curtain rod hanging, they dont even bother to buy multiple drill bits or specialized drill bits and end up damaging customers walls. Since my dad had a good collection of tools even i have my own but since family members desist me doing DIY jobs not buying more tools. Not one interior person actually gets into the field and actually work. I have managed to get people to do big works 10-20K but struggling to get the french door rollers replaced (300-500 rs work - half hr job) asking that same person who did big job to come but still he is not coming , though he says everytime he will come.

      <li>Title::: 'No one actually cares about the GDP, especially the bogus media.'<br />Body: 'For the past few days, there have been numerous so called "media" organizations that have been questioning the coverage of the SSR case in the face of falling GDP growth, unemployment and covid-19 cases.\n\nThe problem with media organizations suddenly worrying about GDP is that they never actually cared about it. You know what makes China so much more powerful than us and so much more stronger than us? It is their GDP growth rate. There was once a time when both China and India were pretty much at the same level in terms of our GDP per capita as well as the overall GDP. China was in fact below India because the infamous Great Chinese Famine had done much more damage to China than the Bengal famine had done to India. So how did China pull ahead?\n\nOne answer - their god damn GDP growth rate.\n\nAfter Mao\'s death, China had Deng Xiaoping at its helm. Deng quickly understood one small but crucial fact, that is, if people had food in their stomach, they won\'t complaint. As history shows us, China logged close to 8-10% of GDP growth rate from 1980s to 2000s. This massive GDP growth rate for several decades together lifted several million Chinese out of poverty. Not just that but with its new found wealth, China became a superpower. Apart from US, there is no country that comes next to China. They have a world class military and spend more in public infrastructure than US and Europe combined.\n\nWhat was India doing?\n\nThe Congress government meanwhile did all it could to wreck the Indian economy. Extensive red tap, license raj, restrictions on company size and an inward facing policy, all wrecked the Indian economy. This continued from independence till the 1990s when the IMF finally forced India to adopt better market oriented policies which set the ball rolling for better GDP growth rate.\n\nWe lost three decades of GDP Growth. When China was pulling ahead, we were slouching behind. I just want to know, what was the country\'s media doing then? Why not constantly question the government on GDP growth rate for all these decades? And even if they did question, why didn\'t the GDP improve?\n\nGDP requires sustained efforts to show results.\n\nIt was only after three decades of nerve wracking GDP growth that China started seeing the results. I am often amused how media personnel and media houses that never bothered about GDP for so many decades are now suddenly worried about the fall in GDP during a single quarter? They act as if one quarter of better GDP growth will improve the country\'s prospects when they themselves were least bothered for so many cumulative entire god damn decades. Why this bogus concern now? Whom are they trying to fool? Who do they think will believe that the same media that didn\'t utter a word or didn\'t improve the GDP for all these decades, can actually do something now?\n\nAm I defending the SSR coverage?\n\nNope, I feel it is stupid. Absolutely stupid. But if you\'re gonna tell me that the Indian media cares about GDP then that\'s just as stupid as the SSR debate if not more.'<br />Author: 'lic_n_reg_pls'  id: 'j0x821'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j0x821/no_one_actually_cares_about_the_gdp_especially/</li>

This is a symptom of why alpha women are actually "stronger" than alpha men in the liberal age.'<br />Body: 'You all know the story till now. I will cut to why this is so....\n\nIn this liberal age when a naturally strong man demonstrates or flexes his strength, the police state descend on him or if he is in a position of power, the loud, vociferous media critiques of his "violence" or "aggression" or "intolerance" or "chauvinistic dominance" will be all over him so quickly and to such an extent, he is unable to continue in any capacity. Remember what happened to Modi after the 2002 Gujarat Riots. \n\nConsequently, he becomes highly cautious, withdraws into a shell/suppresses his outrage and justice-seeking behaviour or has to balance his natural strength with caution, choosing his words and actions very carefully or (like Justin Trudeau or Canada who is a boxing champion and very smart) wears a Liberal Mask so pervasive it changes his personality. That means the qualities and muscles which give him his natural strength *aren\'t exercised, hidden away and over time, they atrophy.*   \n\n\nNow when faced with a dire crisis (such as on the LAC with China) that demands a full demonstration of that strength, those natural male muscles are weak and confused. The endless liberal pressure on his career stretching 30-40 years has subdued his once natural strength or changed his personality.\n\nOTOH, an alpha woman in a position of power (like Indira Gandhi) is celebrated and feted and praised no end when she exercises her strength in the liberal age as a "Strong Woman" - she becomes a darling of the media. Indira Gandhi discovered that with slow probes of which there are many in her early political career. That ability grew and grew and culminated in the 1971 war. She never had to hide or suppress her strength, those muscles did not weaken and she was in full ability when the situations arose.\n\nIt is our Liberal Age and Liberal Media that forgets how they acted in 2002 and 2014 and how duplicitously they now demand a completely different persona when the hour is upon us and a real call for the need for strength arises.'<br />Author: 'pras'  id: 'j0rlij'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j0rlij/modi_20142024_has_been_indias_most_tireless/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] : Should productivity come to a halt due to absolute 'Bandh' in 21st Century India?"<br />Body: "**Note: -** Special thanks to u/xsupermoo for the ideation and primary draft\n\nSocial protest plays an important role in democracies.It has been instrumental in forcing the introduction of most of the freedoms that now exist in liberal democracies. Direct action, mostly nonviolent, played a major role in the ending of slavery, extension of the franchise, curtailing ruthless aspects of the exploitation of labour and extending rights to women and minorities.\n\nOne such form of social protest is 'Bandh'.During a bandh, a political party or a community declare a general strike. For example, a Bharat bandh is a call for a bandh across India, and a bandh can also be called for an individual state or municipality.\n\nThe community or political party declaring a bandh expects the general public to stay at home and not report for work. Business and public transport are supposed to be completely shut off. There have been instances when large metropolitan cities have been brought to a standstill.\n\n**Legal viewpoint on Bandh:**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India ruled against any sort of hooliganism in the name of 'bandh' in 1998, but political parties still organize them. In 2004, it fined two political parties, for organizing a bandh in Mumbai as a protest against bomb blasts in the city.

      <li>Title::: 'Moplah riots a pogrom against Hindus - The 1921 Genocide'<br />Body: '**Who was Kunjahammad Haji ?**\n\nIt is important to understand the persona of Kunjahammad Haji, who rose to notoriety at a young age as a constant cause of law and order problems in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; *The administration exiled him to Mecca after he was found to be involved in a series of communal attacks on Hindus and their places of worship. His main vocation was extortion and supplying women to the Arabs to be held as their concubines.* \n\nAfter his sojourn in Mecca, he was allowed to return to Kerala on the condition that he would not visit his native place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Khilat Movement and Congress**\n\nIn a bid to attract Muslims to the Khilafat Movement, Congress leaders approached him, though he was reluctant to join the movement initially. According to K. Madhavan Nair, the freedom fighter, he was not keen to associate with the Congress, which, Kunjahammad Haji believed, had “Hindu credentials”. But Congress leaders managed to rope him in considering his sway over a section of Muslim youth. It is true that in the initial stages of the riots, he did not turn against the Hindus. However, as the Islamisation drive gained momentum, he showed his true communal colours and took recourse to killing or forcibly converting Hindus into Islam. This irrefutable truth has been recounted and recorded by many victims and witnesses of the riots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Massacre and Conversion of Hindus**\n\nA report published by The Englishman on 6 October 1921 states: “Several recent reports show Variankunnath Kunhammad Haji and Chembakasseri Thangal have decided that all Hindus residing in villages at the mercy of rebel bands should be put to death unless they accept Islam. \n\n**Instances are mentioned in which Hindus had actually been forced to dig their own graves before being butchered.**” \n\nHis cruelty knew no bounds. C. Gopalan Nair writes: \n\n&gt;*“On the outbreak of the rebellion he became king, celebrated his accession by the murder of Khan Bahadur Chekkutti, a Moplah retired Police Inspector, who was decapitated while expiring in his wife’s arms.”*\n\nMoplahs led by Kunjahammad Haji committed unspeakable atrocities on innocent Hindus. The Special Judge hearing riot-related cases, in the judgement, notes: “The rebels seem to have meant to kill every male in the place whom they could catch hold of, and the only survivors were those who either got away or were left as dead. The abduction of a young girl and a boy shows the deliberate ferocity of the attack.” The abducted girl was later rescued from the hands of the rebels “after a detention of six weeks and after suffering indescribable indignities”.\n\nIn terms of participation of the Mappilas, we can say with some amount of certainty that a large percentage of the Mappila population of that area were either an actively or passively participated in the mayhem. According to the official sources, nearly 2,500 of Mappila rioters were killed, 1,652 were wounded, 5,955 were captured, nearly 40,000 were surrendered of which many of them were tried and convicted. This figure indicates that there was a widespread participation of ordinary Mappilas, including women and children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dr Ambedkar on the Moplah Riots**\n\n “There occurred in that year in Malabar what is known as the Moplah Rebellion. It was the result of the agitation carried out by two Muslim organizations, the Khuddam-i-Kaba (servants of the Mecca Shrine) and the Central Khilafat Committee. \n\n&gt;*Agitators actually preached the doctrine that India under the British Government was Dar-ul-Harab and that the Muslims must fight against it and if they could not, they must carry out the alternative principle of Hijrat.*\n\n**Dr. B.R.Ambedkar**: “*This was not a Hindu – Muslim  riot. This was just a Bartholomew. The number of Hindus who were  killed, wounded or converted, is not known. But the number must have  been enormous. The blood-curdling atrocities committed by the Moplas in  Malabar against the Hindus were indescribable. All over southern India, a  wave of horrified feeling had spread among the Hindus of every shade of  opinion… The Hindus were visited by a dire fate at the hands of the  Moplas. Massacre, forcible conversions, desecration of temples, foul  outrages upon women, such as ripping open pregnant women, pillage, arson  and destruction – in short, all the accompaniments of brutal and  unrestrained barbarism, were perpetrated freely by the Moplas upon the  Hindus until such time as troops could be hurries to the task of  restoring order through a difficult and extensive tract of the country*.\n\nThe Moplahs were suddenly carried off their feet by this agitation. The outbreak was essentially a rebellion against the British Government. The aim was to establish the kingdom of Islam by overthrowing the British Government. Knives, swords and spears were secretly manufactured, bands of desperados collected for an attack on British authority. \n\nOn 20th August, a severe encounter took place between the Moplahs and the British forces at Thirurangadi. Roads were blocked, telegraph lines cut, and the runway destroyed in a number of places. As soon as the administration had been paralysed, the Moplahs declared that Swaraj had been established.\n\nA certain Ali Musaliyar was proclaimed Raja, Khilafat flags were flown, and Ernad and Walluvanad were declared Khilafat Kingdoms. As a rebellion against British Government, it was quite understandable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne among those who doubted the logic of Gandhiji’s experiment was Dr Keshav Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the founder of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Once he even met Gandhiji and asked him: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*“As a matter of fact, we have in Bharat people belonging to different faiths like Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Judaism. So, instead of talking about the unity of all these people what is the rationale behind talking only about Hindu-Muslim unity?” Gandhiji retorted: “Through this, my idea is to create love for this nation in the minds of Muslims here, and don’t you see the spectacle of their fighting shoulder to shoulder with others for India’s freedom?” Doctorji, who was not satisfied with this answer, again said: “Even before this slogan was coined, many Muslims like Barrister Jinnah, Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan, etc. were active under the leadership of Lokmanya Tilak in the freedom movement. And I fear this slogan will create divisive tendencies in the Minds of Muslims.” Gandhi ji abruptly wound up the meeting saying “I don’t have such fear.” (Dr. Hedgewar by Nana Palkar: page 99).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Annie Beasant, President – Theosophical Society**:\n\n “*They  established the Khilafat Raj, crowned a king, murdered and plundered  abundantly, and killed or drove away all Hindus who would not  apostatize. Somewhere about a lakh people were driven from their homes  with nothing but the clothes they had on, stripped of everything. A  pregnant woman carrying 7 months was cut through the abdomen by a rebel  and she was seen lying dead on the way with the dead child projecting  out of the womb. Another baby of six months was snatched away from the  breast of his own mother and cut into two pieces. Are these rebels’  human beings or monsters? … A respectable Nayar lady at Melatur was  stripped naked by the rebels in the presence of her husband and  brothers, who were made to stand close by with their hands tied behind.  When they shut their eyes in abhorrence they were compelled at the point  of sword to open their eyes and witness the rape committed by the brute  in their presence. … menwho have lost all, hopeless, crushed,  desperate. Can you conceive of a more ghastly and inhuman crime than the  murders of babies and pregnant women?* … *Mr. Gandhi… can he not  feel a little sympathy for thousands of women left with only rags,  driven from home, for little children born of the flying mothers on  roads in refugee camps? The misery is beyond description. Girl wives,  pretty and sweet, with eyes half blind with weeping, distraught with  terror; women who have seen their husbands hacked to pieces before their  eye, in the way “moplahs consider as religious”; old women tottering,  whose faces become written with anguish and who cry at a gentle touch..”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/9/25/Ghost-of-Malabar-.html***](https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/9/25/Ghost-of-Malabar-.html)\n\n[***https://vskkerala.com/malabarhindugenocideday-wounds-so-deep-we-wont-forget/***](https://vskkerala.com/malabarhindugenocideday-wounds-so-deep-we-wont-forget/)\n\n[***https://kreately.in/keralas-malabar-hindu-genocide-of-1921-uncovering-jihadist-tendencies-of-the-moplah-riots-in-ernad/***](https://kreately.in/keralas-malabar-hindu-genocide-of-1921-uncovering-jihadist-tendencies-of-the-moplah-riots-in-ernad/)\n\n[***https://theprint.in/india/why-1921-malabar-moplah-rebellion-wasnt-a-peasant-uprising-but-an-anti-hindu-genocide/485065/***](https://theprint.in/india/why-1921-malabar-moplah-rebellion-wasnt-a-peasant-uprising-but-an-anti-hindu-genocide/485065/)\n\n[***https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/9/25/Ghost-of-Malabar-.html***](https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/9/25/Ghost-of-Malabar-.html)\n\n[***https://www.pgurus.com/observe-the-1921-malabar-massacre-as-a-black-day/***](https://www.pgurus.com/observe-the-1921-malabar-massacre-as-a-black-day/)\n\n[***https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/moplah-riots-pogrom-hindus***](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/moplah-riots-pogrom-hindus)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'j0nbp9'<br />Score:139<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j0nbp9/moplah_riots_a_pogrom_against_hindus_the_1921/</li>

They do not directly criticize the religion itself or call all Christians "idiots and backward fools" for supporting Trump.\n\n\nInstead, they try to show how Trump doesn\'t conform to the traditional values of religion and hence the claim that Trump is somehow a "savior" (some actually believe that -- US bhakths?) or a devout theist must be called into question.\n\n\nOn the other hand in India our leftist media more often then not tries to defame Hinduism, calling religious people as stupid, and imply saffron clothes as somehow a symbol of terrorism. \n\n\nThis has to change. \n\n\nFor as long as there are people who aim to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus, there will always be a party like BJP to use this opportunity. Unless this changes, BJP will likely stay in power for a long long time.'<br />Author: 'shiskeyoffles'  id: 'j0mawq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j0mawq/what_indian_media_should_learn_from_us_media_when/</li>

Indian culture is the unity in diversity."\n\nNow see the steps by the British: \n\n\n1. Divide by religion\n\n2. Divide by language\n\n\n3. Divide by caste\n\nThe British Raj introduced elements of reservation in the Government of India Act of 1909 and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.[1] A significant one emerged from the Round Table Conference of June 1932, when the Prime Minister of Britain, Ramsay MacDonald, proposed the Communal Award, according to which separate representation was to be provided for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: Mahatma Gandhi fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including B. R. Ambedkar, favored it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with Dalits having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the Poona Pact.\n\n\nBy first dividing the nation by religion and then by language and then by caste; was this the planned mischief by the British so that people can keep identifying themselves into more and more subgroups so that there is no "Indian" culture left?\n\n\nI think there is this longing among the people to become one culture with "unity in diversity". I think that is why the BJP has emerged as a clear winner by bringing up our common Indian culture, instead of \'divide &amp; rule\''<br />Author: 'pleaaseeeno92'  id: 'j0fmai'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/j0fmai/do_you_think_that_dividing_the_country_into/</li>

We would also travel to Mumbai on the same flight. We had our rendezvous in JW Marriott in Andheri. \n\n&gt;My government wanted a proposal for opening a branch of Habib Bank in India to be approved. On behalf of the Islamic Government of Pakistan, I paid a total of 30 crores to Digivijay Singh and his accomplices. But he could not prevail upon the same and one Mr. Halder, Director IB vetoed the proposal.\n\n&gt;Thereafter, we sought the help of the Himalayan Bank of Nepal for carrying out the agenda of our Government but some R&amp;AW officer prevailed upon the Himalayan Bank and in the end bargain I was left in the lurch. My Government grew suspicious of me.\n\n&gt;In the Batla House encounter also he took 2 crores from me when he was accompanied by some people from Azamgarh. But he did not do anything and the money was taken away by Dr. Mohammaed to Gulf.  Digvijay promised action against the concerned officers. \n\n&gt;Digvijay Singh also promised to deflect the focus from the 2008 attack. The meeting was held in Mumbai and Union Minister Mr. Antulay was also present. Both these gentlemen were paid huge amounts of money, with Antulay promising that he will shake the Parliament and ensure divert the attention of the government and public. All he did was make an irrelevant and ineffective speech which had no effect as promised by him\n\n&gt;During one of the meetings one MP Mr. Abu Azmi was brought to me by Mr. Digvijay Singh for which I paid him money at the behest of Digvijay Singh, but Abu Azmi also reneged on the promise.\n\n&gt;Another meeting with an MLA of Mumbai Mr. Azam Khan was also paid money to carry out certain Missions in Maharashtra but he was also found to be very ineffective and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan’s money was sunk.\n\n\n\n&gt;Mr. Kripa Singh a Minister in the Government of Maharashtra, would insist that he would take fake  Indian Rupees three times the amount. He would also insist that some of our outfits should source arms from his factories near Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. He had a lot of contacts in Uttar Pradesh in Banks. He could introduce Fake Indian Rupees through these contacts very easily.\n\n&gt;The above are only some cases and there were many other overt missions for which I paid my  Government’s money to the pointsman Mr. Digvijay Singh for which I would not show results. It is a matter of fact that money was also spent on hiring smaller Bollywood actresses engaged through Kripa Singh, for the benefit of our own High Commissioner Mr. Shahid Malik as well as many Indian political personalities. “\n\nhttps://goachronicle.com/indian-politicians-are-greedy-unreliable-and-can-be-cultivated-former-pakistani-diplomat-to-indian-asset/'<br />Author: 'its_my_36th_account'  id: 'izxpqk'<br />Score:39<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/izxpqk/report_of_an_indian_asset_from_pakistan_high/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Filter'<br />Body: 'I didn\'t wanna flair this as politics and more as sci-fi, but the political overtones that I might be making... Eh, might as well. And everyone only even clicks on the topic if it\'s either political memes or politics. Think of this as reddit clickbait. I\'m not sorry in the slightest. I know I\'m shameless, tell me something new. \n\nThis is basically a talk prompt that was given to me when I was in school having to choose a topic and talk about it, we all know that one. What I chose was the great filter, and specifically a case to why any alien species we may come across will be hostile, and will most definitely fuck stomp us to near or total extinction. \n\nLet\'s start this with what the great filter actually is. A good start is the excellent video Kurzgesagt made on this very topic. I\'m not covering the entire video, put just put up some parts of it for a basic understanding. I\'ll have that linked down in the comments(hopefully, if I remember).\n\nWhat the great filter is, is an answer. To the very basic of questions. Where are they? Where are all the bloody aliens? Every time we look up at the stars, we see the beauty that nature is. The insignificance of our own \'pale blue dot\' as Carl Sagan so aptly put it. And wonder, are we alone? Are we all that the universe has to offer, or can there be better? Of course, only if you can actually see them, with light pollution and all, but I digress. There are about a billion planets that can hold life, in any capacity. Say a miniscule fraction of them give rise to intelligent life. Go however far as you wish to, that\'s still thousands of intelligent species populating the galaxy.\n\nSo why haven\'t we found any yet? Why do we not see any? They may be spread across space and time, and you\'ll still have civilisations that may be spanning entire star systems, which will then most definitely have communication systems and means of travel that can deal with travel on that scale. \n\nThe answer to this very question is the great filter. It is by no means the only answer. But it is an answer, and I personally like this one as my favorite. \n\nThe great filter, why we don\'t see civilisations, is because there are none. They\'re all wiped out, and we\'re going to be no different. Something that makes this cosmos so unforgiving. It\'s not self inflicted harm, like nuclear war or climate change, for those are minor generational setbacks, lasting hundreds of thousands of years at most. A miniscule fraction compared compared to the lifetimes of stars and planets. What the great filter is, is up for debate. Natural phenomenon, like say GRBs irradiating worlds, to the very vastness of space, making travel impossible keeping species bound in the prison that is their single star system. To intergalactic warfare. Yeah, we\'re going Independence Day style, without Will Smith to upload some half baked virus in some impossibly stupid alien technology. And from here is where I start to draw parallels to our history. \n\nLet\'s start at why I think any alien species that we stumble upon(or to be more accurate, stumbles upon us) will most definitely curb stomp us. \n\nLook at the colonisation efforts around the world. The Americas most particularly, insulated from the rest of the world for thousands of years until Cortez decided to tear them a new one. A colonisation spree that nearly wiped the natives out. A dominant civilisation on their land reduced to a debatable shade of their former glory. Diseases that the natives had no immunity against, technology that they had no counter to. Millions of people dead at the hands of not more than a hundred Spanish colonists. Yet the gap between the two was not great. A few hundred years at most. Now an exercise in imagination. Take any minor military power today, and pit it against the most dominant power of a few hundred years ago. Pit it against the naval might of the empire on which the sun never sets, or the land dominance of the riders of the steppes. Both will be utterly decimated, humiliated. Yet only a gap of a few hundred years. \n\nThis was humanity apart from its own genetic brothers by a meagre thousand kilometers separated by water. Think of the head start another civilisation may have on us when at distances and times so spaced apart, that it may amount to millions of years. To a point that making comparisons to our technology today to our cave dwellings ancestors before they even knew what fire was, doesn\'t capture the full picture. \n\nNow let\'s turn to why it may be hostile. India and China have had their internal squabbles, but were both prosperous and "comparatively" pacifist civilisations, in the sense that they were not imperialist. Separated by the Himalayas, so making any invasions of each other impractical. They did not send out expeditions to new lands in search of resources, going out planting flags in the name of his/her majesty. Who did put out expeditions? The Europeans. Competing kingdoms, who could only grab each others lands, which was finite. All at roughly equal power levels. How do you change the status quo? Look out. See for new lands that will make your flag more powerful. Your nation more prosperous. And how does that land become yours? You take it from someone else, who isn\'t going to give it to you with his heart full of happiness and understanding kissing you all over. You capture, you kill, you steal. \n\nThat is what I base my statements on. That anyone we encounter among the stars is most definitely gonna fuck us to death. Let\'s just hope it\'s not literally. \n\nThis came out much longer than I expected it to, but okay. If you made it thus far, I congratulate you for being able to keep up with my not great writing.\n\nTldr? We\'re all fucked, regardless of what God you worship, or what gender you are, or what group you identify with.

A Kṛṣṇa conscious person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action.

      <li>Title::: "Let's face it. The BJP doesn't ACTUALLY care about Hindus."<br />Body: 'If you\'re above the age of 11 and have basic knowledge of Indian politics and law, then I have no need to explain to you that Hindus are discriminated against in this country. If you aren\'t, then please stop reading further; this article is probably beyond your mental capacity. I recommend another great website called "The Wire" which will provide you with excellent details. With that being said, here is what Hindus ought to realize about the law:\n\nSome discriminations are rather academic and only consequential at several removes. Thus, the understanding of religious freedom as guaranteed in Article 25, especially the inclusion of the right to propagate one’s religion and thus to encourage others to convert, is tailor-made for the Christian mission. This interest group had successfully lobbied to ensure that the right to convert be included in the Constitution. It also fits the Islamic design to Islamize all of humanity, but the notion of conversion is foreign to Hindus. So, the constitutional right to convert seemingly creates a level playing field, counting for all religions, yet in practice it upholds a right central to Christianity and Islam but meaningless (except negatively) to Hinduism. It legalizes the aggression by the foreign and conquering religions to the detriment of the indigenous religion.\n\nAt the initiative of the Scheduled Tribes, targets par excellence of the missionary efforts, several Indian states have enacted laws against forcible or fraudulent conversion (which according to the missionaries and their secularist allies are non-existent anyway). But these state laws can never acquire teeth as long as the Constitution guarantees the right to propagate religion. Thanks to this unshakable guarantee, the missionary apparatus considers these anti-conversion laws as but a weak scarecrow, useful only to solidify its own internationally propagated image of hapless victims being persecuted by a violent Hindu majority.\n\nThe most consequential and effective discrimination is comprised in Article 30. It guarantees *to the minorities* (leaving the majority unmentioned) the right to found and manage educational institutions. This means that Hindu schools can be nationalized or subjected to other government controls from which minority schools are exempt. In the application of this discrimination, the Right to Education Act, enacted by the Congress-Communist coalition in 2008, imposes a back-breaking burden on Hindu schools (putting hundreds out of business), and from which it exempts minority schools.\n\nBut before this too, the discrimination was already palpable. In the 1980s the Ramakrishna Mission’s schools in West Bengal were harassed by the Communist teachers’ unions and threatened with nationalization. Instead of appealing to Hindu society to come to its rescue, and instead of challenging the discriminatory rules which made this hostile takeover possible, it dishonorably decided to abandon Hindu society and distance \xa0itself from all other Hindu sects that invest in schooling. The Ramakrishna Mission approached the Court to get itself recognized as a non-Hindu minority, exemplifying the scramble for the exit from Hinduism.\n\nThe RK Mission failed in its attempt at de-Hinduization, as had happened before already to the Sri Aurobindo Society: the Court had to admit that the respective founders, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, had explicitly stated that they were Hindu and had never intended to found a new religion. But the Arya Samaj at the Punjab state level, the Jains, and the Lingayats did succeed in getting recognition as non-Hindu minority religions.\n\nThe point is that Article 30 is a constant invitation to the Hindu sects to leave Hinduism. It tends to divide Hindu society. Apart from the sheer injustice of this anti-Hindu discrimination, its power to trigger the division of Hindu society should be reason enough for pro-Hindu activists to do something about it. It also helps to confirm the state’s right to interfere in other fields of Hindu life, especially the places of worship, again unlike the minorities’ inviolable churches and mosques.\n\nThese two areas — education and places of worship — are extremely important in today’s world. In centuries past, children became Hindu by spontaneously absorbing the religion and culture because these were all around them. That is much less the case today. By contrast, formal schooling is far more important than ever before. Keep the teaching of Hinduism out of the schools (a requirement of enforcing “secularism”, but only on the Hindus), and it will enter the children’s minds less and less. Unknown makes unloved, and it makes Hindus unable to defend the choice for Hinduism to others and even to themselves. This way, they become easy prey for whomever wants to seduce them into abandoning their ancestral religion and entering other worlds and embracing other worldviews and ways of life. For Hinduism, removing these discriminations is, or rather should be, a matter of life and death.\n\nNo one has ever tried or influenced the government into finally taking up the problem of this Constitutional inequality. Most people are probably not even aware about it. For the Government, it has not made any difference. In 2018 there was a Private Bill by BJP MP Satyapal Singh, but both the party and the Government refused to take it up.\n\nIf BJP and Narendra Modi actually cared about Hinduism, and weren\'t just concerned about appearing so, they would have prepared the correct parliamentary procedures before acceding to power and set to work in 2014 itself. Failing that, they could have come to their senses in the next phase, and belatedly set to work anyway. Instead, while they may have done their job on the development front, they remained emphatically passive on the “communal” front. Many in there are just timeservers satisfied with enjoying the perks of being in government.\n\nThe slightly more principled types, of RSS background, have absorbed so much of secularist thought that the idea of recognizing and abolishing anti-Hindu discriminations that are strangling Hindu life, just does not even occur to them. Instead, they take pride in outdoing Congress in minority appeasement, having replaced Hindutva with “BJP secularism” as their ideological backbone. Even independent activist Hindus tend to get carried away by minor issues and muster no more than fleeting attention to the main issue.\n\nThe problem here is that we Hindus are suckers for tokenism. With superficial gestures, wearing Hindu clothes, and getting filmed visiting a temple here and there, BJP ministers can assure themselves of Hindu votes. A child’s hand is easy to fill, and Hindus will gladly believe that only economic issues are “the real issues”, while the reforms that would make a difference to the life and future of Hinduism are but "asking for too much too soon", as many of my fellow right-wing friends have told me when I discuss these things with them.\n\nWhen put on the spot, we defend the BJP’s actual performance against the ideals to which they were once committed, like “justice for all, appeasement of none”. We insist that the leaders “need time”: even after more than six years in power, without discerning any intention of the BJP to stray from the Nehruvian path of minority appeasement (for that is what maintaining the anti-Hindu discrimination amounts to), many are still not ashamed to say this, all while consistently remaining passive on the issues for which they supposedly needed that time.\n\nThis post is not all doom and gloom. I have a few ideas that I think Hindus need to take up and make DEMANDS of the BJP. Not measly, half-hearted requests, but demands.\n\nIf we want to achieve any goal, we must be coldly realistic. Let us face the fact that there is very little commitment among even activist Hindus to abolish these discriminations. This is an instance of a situation with which leaders ought to be familiar. Some policies have popular appeal, but other policies, though the best-informed and most prescient leaders see how necessary they are, just don’t ring a bell among the people. Yet, if a leader explains the need for abolishing these discriminations, every parliamentarian of the BJP (and many others too) will fall in line. Many don’t think it is a priority, some had never thought about it, but no one will object to it.\n\nThis is all the more true because abolishing the Constitutional inequality between Hindus and non-Hindus is not hard to do. First of all, it may not even be necessary to amend the Constitution; possibly it is enough to approach the Supreme Court for an authoritative opinion. The judges may point out that the Constituent Assembly could not have meant to deny Hindus the rights they were giving to the minorities. At that time, Muslims and Christians were on the defensive, acutely feeling how they were deemed guilty of the Partition massacres, and the just-concluded colonial exploitation. The Hindu members had no reason at all to enact discriminations against themselves.\n\nSecondly, if amending the Constitution still proves necessary, this need not be insurmountable. Many opposition MPs may support reforms amounting to more equality. Congress and other parties still have their eyes on the Hindu vote-bank: maybe they never would have taken the initiative for this reform, but they will hesitate to oppose it once it is there. And with the thumping majority that it has, the BJP needs very few votes from outside. What a luxury, which they and we will miss it when it’s gone.\n\nThe normalization of the Kashmir situation was harder, needing lots of security precautions and triggering many negative reactions from the usual suspects. But the BJP was ready to take these challenges on, partly because it was a safely secular issue. Everybody knows the separate status of Kashmir was due to its character as a Muslim-majority state, yet the relevant laws did not mention religion. It could be framed in terms of *national* unity, a discourse in which the RSS and the BJP are more at home than in anything pertaining to *Hindu* aspirations.\n\nOnce religion comes into the picture, the going gets tougher. This was clear from the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) controversy earlier this year, about the welcome to be given to non-Muslims oppressed in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Here, the enemy had it easy to deduce BJP “fascism” from the obvious “inequality” between religions in the CAA. This inequality between oppressed communities and the oppressor community had its justification, but the mere mention of inequality counted as criminal to most outside observers. The episode ended as a publicity failure, a loss of face for the BJP government, at least among the leftist and neutral people of the country, as around the world. The main reason could be attributed to the BJP not even bothering to make press appearances and explain to people what CAA actually means. The permission given for Shaheen Bagh to keep festering, when it should have been removed the very first day itself, was also a pathetically disastrous move.\n\nWell, here we don’t have to accept the burden of a word that triggers negative knee-jerk reactions. Here we don’t have to justify "inequality", only to advertise equality. Who could be against equality?\n\nThat the Constitution discriminates against Hinduism, and that this has large-scale consequences for the transmission of Hinduism to the next generation, is one of India’s better-kept secrets. Most academics suppress this information and pretend loudly that India is a secular state, i.e. a state with equality of all citizens before the law. It is not, and the good implication is that for secularists it will be hard to object to a reform that would turn India into a secular state, one in which no religion is discriminated against.\n\nOf course, the secularists are going to resist this normalization of India’s interreligious relations. They will for the first time be put in a position of openly having to defend inequality, but some will find a way of stooping that low without getting a bad conscience. Thus, some will say that in order to achieve equality, a little bit of inequality is necessary. That is the principle behind America’s “affirmative action”.\n\nSo, they will claim (and we already have heard some professors, when pressed to pronounce on this, affirm it) that as a majority, the Hindus owe the minorities something. But in a secular state, there is no such thing as a minority: there are only equal citizens. To insist nonetheless on this point, they will allege that the American white majority has kept the black minority as slaves, ergo majorities commit injustice against minorities (an unjustified generalization); ergo in India too the majority has oppressed the minorities.\n\nWell, we have news for them: no, the Hindus have never oppressed Christians nor the Muslims. The reverse, yes. So, if inequality can be justified as a compensation for past injustice, then it is the Christians and Muslims who must pay compensation.\n\nBut we should not go that far. For the present and future, simple equality will do.\n\nThe achievement of equality is not the end. Once the state has created a level playing field, civil society has the task of using the opportunities that arise. Hindus will have to take initiatives. A religion that relies on state patronage will become weak.\n\nHindus should not want (and fortunately, by and large don’t want) to replace a system discriminating against them by a system where they can discriminate against others. Just equality will do, and then let the best principles and way of life win. But that very limited goal of equality is really necessary and is now becoming urgent.\n\nAfter 2019 even more than before, most BJP supporters(and I admit, I was one of them) smugly assume that the BJP are natural election-winners, so that they can safely postpone any jobs till next term. Right now, the opposition is in relative disarray and not in a position to win against the BJP. But this can change. Case in point: The accession to power of the Janata Party, prepared by Jayaprakash Narayan’s mass campaign that galvanized the opposition against the seemingly invincible Indira Gandhi. In the coming years too, we might see the rise of a leader who manages to unite and motivate the opposition.\n\nIf the BJP loses power, many Hindus will rue the missed opportunities. What are the chances that an avowedly secularist government will care about justice for Hinduism and take the initiative to revise Articles 25-30? Crying and gnashing of teeth, that is what many Hindus will feel when they realize that the seemingly timeless window of opportunity has passed, and that an ever-shrinking Hindu society has little chance of ever bringing it back.\n\nBut it need not come that far. We still have more than three years to get the job taken up and finished. What have we done to persuade the BJP leadership to use the unique window of opportunity that still presents itself? What can we do to persuade the BJP to take up these demands? Please provide me your suggestions.'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'izgflo'<br />Score:59<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/izgflo/lets_face_it_the_bjp_doesnt_actually_care_about/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Midnight Adventure : Part III'<br />Body: 'I placed my heels in the gap between boulders and gradually descended stopping just a few inches from the water. \n\nThe shallow waves were lapping against the rocks, its tranquil sound much more apparent now. The moon had risen further up the sky its reflection in the water, tracing a shimmering ivory path. The mist had grown much thicker now, its spectral form  almost opaque. \n\nClimbing down the dam only gained me a minor respite. The gust was more subdued yet growing colder by the second as the night advanced. It had me begun questioning if the view was worth the torment. Though I chuckled to myself thinking, of the seven billion people on this planet how many would have had or would\xa0 sit where I sat and see this dreamy spectacle, I was privy to. Being at the extremes of mathematical probability was certainly not an everyday occurrence. \n\nAs I took the phone out to click few pictures more, the widget on the screen showed the temperature, 7 degrees. It was time to go.\n\nI climbed back up on the wall and looked down the twenty-five feet drop on the other side. It was one thing climbing moist grass, going down on it, was a whole different ball game. And I certainly wasn\'t fancying a three storied slippery slide straight into babools. \n\nIf you have ever done rock climbing, you would know that down climbing is the last resort, but if you must go for broke then you should climb down facing the rock. Or in this case, the dam wall. There was no place for footing and I was certain that one way or another I would slip. \n\nThere wasn\'t much time to think, getting hit by the cold drafts. I lowered myself on the slope facing the wall. My hands still on the edge for grip. With one hand I pulled my knife out, flicked it open and rammed it into the grass. Feeling it well lodged, I began descending. The knife provided enough hold with most my weight against the wall,\xa0 stabbing it into the wall for each down step. I finally reached the ground without slipping once. \n\nI knew it was midnight since the moon was directly above me. The whole area was now illuminated and made me feel like as if I had stepped into Goethes poem. There was mist all around, rising from the ground engulfing the thorny acacia. I wondered if I could make an elf out of few trees, with their twisted spindly arm like branches and jagged stumps.\n\nThe night was getting colder and it had become imperative to light a fire. I parked the bike parallel to the wall, to provide maximum protection against the wind with enough gap inbetween for a small fire and a sleeping area large enough for me. I grabbed the shawl, wrapped myself and went to find some dry wood.\n\n Even minor moisture on a dry wood makes it hard to ignite fire. In such case you can remove the bark and the insides are perfectly flammable. Likewise, I removed the bark and set it inside a circle of small rocks. It was to prevent a prevent a random ember landing upon me while sleeping close to the fire. \n\n\nAnd I was feeling sleeping already. It was a good idea to check how much colder it was going to get before sleeping. I checked the forecast, it showed by 3 o clock it would drop to four degrees. \n\n"Outstanding"\n\nI thought, if I sleep and the fire goes out I will pass from this life like an icicle, which is such an uncool way to go about it. \n\nHence, I decided to keep the bike running. It had enough fuel to last till daybreak. The engine would provide enough warmth to ride the night out. \n\nThrough my camping trips I had learnt the hard way that you should avoid sleeping on ground outside. It drains your body heat faster and is responsible for the fatal hypothermia. \n\nThe mattress I had was thin. Thus I decided to sleep leaning against the bike. That way I would have less contact with the ground, which meant I could wrap the remaining mattress around me and have my core near the engine.\n\nThe fire was crackling cheerfully with the engine idling behind me, I drifted into sleep taxed but warm.\n\nThere was a loud crack, reassured that fire was still burning I felt sated. In my half asleep state it took me a moment to register that the fire had been burning by my side and the sound had come from the back. My eyes flew wide open, the fire had gone out. As I raised my head above the seat, I could see shiloutte of a man standing near the trees on the right, nearly twenty feet away. \n\nAs he stepped forward I could see his arm was arched holding a stick. I had never been in a flight or fight situation before. I didn\'t even realise my brain had locked on to flight. I was already astride the bike, as I zapped it around I heard footsteps running closer. Instinctively I ducked while speeding out, the stick flew past where my head would have been a moment ago, when I realised there were two voices yelling behind me. I thanked my stars, for deciding to leave the bike running. My heart rate only matched by the speed of the bike. I looked back, there was no one following. \n\nI do not know how long I rode, by the time I stopped the bike I was at the turn which overlooked the village. My heart rate had calmed down a bit. I checked the time, it was 3 a.m. I also realised I had left my backpack with everthing in it near the fire. \n\nRiding back to the city was out of question. The four degrees felt more colder as it is and riding in such condition would make the windchill shave off even those four degrees effectively bringing it into negative. \n\nAs effects of the adrenaline were wearing off I realised I couldn\'t feel my fingers. And it had started to feel as if pins were piercing them. I got off the bike and held the hot exhaust in my hands. It took some time to warm the gloves and the fingers. \n\nWhile I sat there thinking deciding what to do next. Sleep deprived, hazed and cold it was hard to think straight. And\xa0surprisingly enough was feeling angry, at myself. Incensed that my brain chose flight instead of fighting. \n\nMy anger no matter how torrid could not provide insulation against the biting cold. There was no point sitting there, bikes exhaust was proving very deficient against the chill.\n\nTo this day I have no explanation as to why I didn\'t go to the village asking for help. Instead I decided to go back and take the backpack with all my things. It was 3.30 am, there was a chance whoever the attackers were, had gone away.\n\nI got on the bike and rode very slowly, lying close to the fuel tank to avoid the wind, till the bifurcation. The road going towards dam was downhill. I turned the bike towards the dam, accelerated for a few meters, turned off the engine and pulled the clutch, so as to avoid alerting the attackers if they were still in the area. There was still enough moonlight so I had turned the headlamps off as well. \n\nI could see the clearing where I had turned in from afar. I stopped the bike, in the dead of  night, the sound of tires and wheel-bearing was loud enough to be heard from a distance. \n\nI got off from the bike and walked stealthily till the edge of clearing, checking the road multiple times for movement. As I peaked in, I saw the two attackers warming their hands to the fire sitting on my mattress huddled together in my shawl. I saw the stick thrown at me lying midway from the entrance of the clearing.\n\nAnd for the second time in my life I felt my body go in flight or fight mode. And this time it chose fight. I moved with a speed I did not know I was capable of. By the time the sounds of my steps were noticed I had already picked up the stick, past midway. By the time they had managed to stand they were within my striking range, the man in the front raised his arms in defence. His left forearm came in contact with my swing and I felt his ulna give out. He fell to the left, I did have time to generate enough backlift for the second attacker standing behind as he caught the stick and landed into the fire as my left foot had soundly landed into his gut. His partner was scurrying away, the other guy quickly bounced away from the fire, got up holding his abdomen took one look at the knife which I had draw now and set off behind his partner, ducking to avoid the embers I had kicked in their direction. There was no time to waste lest they found courage to come back, I quickly stuffed the mattress, wrapped the shawl, slung the back pack and set off towards the bike, checking behind if I was followed. I felt relived as I reached the bike. Turned in the key and rode straight to the village. \n\nIt was still dark and village felt like a ghost town. I was too exhausted to start a fire. I needed a place to crash and fast, the cold was unbearable now. I found a large double door made out of tin and wooden frame. It was locked with chains but had enough width for me to squeeze through. I parked the bike behind a tree and got in. \n\nIt was a cattle shed. I spotted an empty slot next to an auburn coloured cow. Telling myself beggars arent choosers I laid down the mattress next to her. I do not know when exactly the smell of cow dung gave wave to sleep. \n\nI felt a unkempt brush sliding on my face. Thinking whoever would do such a thing I woke up with the tail of the auburn cow sweeping my face. I did not wait for anything else to slide down on my face and got up.\n\nI checked the watch, it was 7 am. It was time for me to slip out before anyone caught me there. I gave a few pats to the cow to receive a resounding\n\n"Hambhaaaaaaaaaah"\n\nI squeezed out of the door still wearing the shawl.\xa0 Turned the bike on, it had just enough fuel to get me to my own bed.\n\nThe journey to home was a blur. I dont remember much of it. When I opened the door of my room I saw the big fat copy of community medicine textbook lying on the bed. As I was putting it away irritated, a random neuron remembered what the lecturer had said in the last class \n\n"No matter how good your hypothesis is, there is always 5% probability of error in it" \n\n"If only I had remembered that..."\n\nI chuckled to myself as I lied down on bed and gave myself up to the sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0'<br />Author: 'Albela__Sajan'  id: 'iyy3za'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iyy3za/the_midnight_adventure_part_iii/</li>

      <li>Title::: "You guys wouldn't believe the day I had!"<br />Body: 'I am a student of Class 11 and preparing for CLAT. I regularly have CLAT classes along with my normal school classes online. To cut a long story short, today\'s CLAT class was about GK and current affairs. The teacher asked us questions about recent news among others and we answered him.\n\nEventually, we came to a question which asked, "Which state government has recently announced that it will donate cows to families of malnutritioned children?". The answer, as you all know is Yogiji\'s state UP.\n\nThe teacher told us about the decision in a very secular way, "This can only have one answer. We all know who is obsessed with cows....." Then he went on and said how this decision will help the poor families as they can get milk, butter, cheese.........\n\nUntil one girl butted in and said, "Beef!". Everyone, including the teacher laughed uproariously as if it was the greatest joke in the world. I obviously didn\'t find it that funny, but seeing I was alone and not wanting to create a scene, I stayed silent.\n\nThe teacher then explained again in a very secular way, "Beta, beef is a one-time food. Then how will they survive? If the cow is alive, then they can continue getting food".......never mind, that it\'s against the law.........."But, mast joke!! Main isko post karunga Yogi Adityanath ji ko tag karke, phir mujhe bhi jail main dal denge". Everyone again laughed.\n\nAt the end of the class, we came to a question about the media. Something related to its code or law. Since it was the last question, the teacher said, "Okay finished. Anyone has any doubts to ask? About any recent news?"\n\nI actually had a doubt in my mind regarding the previous order of the SC in the Sudarshan TV case that said now "5 distinguished citizens" will regulate the electronic media. I asked him isn\'t that dangerous? To curtail media freedom?\n\nSuddenly, the temperature dropped subzero. You could actually feel the awkwardness in the room......after what must be 30 or 40 seconds, the teacher finally said, "See, these things are all fake news......it\'s very difficult to pass a competitive exam like IAS.....this is only politicians using it for political benefits........"\n\nNotice that I hadn\'t even asked him about the details of the Sudarshan TV case. I simply asked him whether there is any constitutional power residing with the SC that allows it to adjudicate about regulating electronic media. I once again asked him to comment on the overall impact of the order.\n\nAnd then lol..................\n\nOne girl interrupted and in a broken, tear-filled voice said, "Why are you so full of hate?".........I was flabbergasted and for some time, I just couldn\'t speak.....were these the same people who were laughing madly a few minutes before about a pathetic joke of people eating beef?\n\nI eventually said, "Hate? I just asked a question regarding the law". And then, the teacher said the most secular thing I\'ve heard in my life, "But, don\'t ask such questions, na? Such type of questions are offensive.....That girl was almost crying, I think........"\n\nThis time, I couldn\'t contain myself, turned my mic off and laughed for an entire 3 minutes. "Almost crying?" "Questions are offensive"? These people are going to appear law examinations? These are the people who will fight cases in court and defend their clients? Are these guys in Class 11 or 1?\n\nAnyhow, the class eventually came to an end. But before it ended, we were given some more pearls of secular wisdom by our teacher, "Don\'t focus on politics. It won\'t come in your exam. Just focus on your studies. Don\'t support those politicians who are burning our country.......Hum sab bhai bhai hain....." Hahahaha!!!!!\n\nSorry if I wasted your time, just thought about sharing this beautiful moment with you.\n\nP.S.- All the students and the teacher are Hindus, by the way.

      <li>Title::: 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020'<br />Body: 'Introduced by  Ministry:\xa0Agriculture and Farmers Welfare\n\n**Introduced:**  Sep 14, 2020,  Lok Sabha, Passed -  Sep 17, 2020\n\nRajya Sabha -  Sep 20, 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Highlights of the Ordinance**\n\n* The  Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation)  Ordinance, 2020 allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’  produce beyond the physical premises of APMC markets. \xa0State governments  are prohibited from levying any market fee, cess or levy outside APMC areas.\xa0\n* The  Farmers Agreement Ordinance creates a framework for contract farming  through an agreement between a farmer and a buyer prior to the  production or rearing of any farm produce. \xa0It provides for a  three-level dispute settlement mechanism: the conciliation board,  Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Appellate Authority.\n* The  Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 allows the central  government to regulate the supply of certain food items only under  extraordinary circumstances (such as war and famine). \xa0Stock limits may  be imposed on agricultural produce only if there is a steep price rise.\xa0\n\n \n\n**Key Issues and Analysis**\n\n* The  three Ordinances aim to increase the availability of buyers for  farmers’ produce, by allowing them to trade freely without any license  or stock limit, so that an increase in competition among them results in  better prices for farmers. \xa0While the Ordinances aim to liberalise  trade and increase the number of buyers, de-regulation alone may not be  sufficient to attract more buyers.  \n \n* The  Standing Committee on Agriculture (2018-19) noted that availability of a  transparent, easily accessible, and efficient marketing platform is a  pre-requisite to ensure remunerative prices for farmers. \xa0Most farmers  lack access to government procurement facilities and APMC markets. \xa0It  noted that small rural markets can emerge as a viable alternative for  agricultural marketing if they are provided with adequate infrastructure  facilities. \xa0  \n \n* The  Standing Committee also recommended that the Gramin Agricultural  Markets scheme (which aims to improve infrastructure and civic  facilities in 22,000 Gramin Haats across the country) should be made a  fully funded central scheme and scaled to ensure presence of a Haat in  each panchayat of the country.\n\n \n\n**Key Features**\n\n**The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020**\n\n* **Trade of farmers’ produce:**\xa0The  Ordinance allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce  outside: (i) the physical premises of market yards run by market  committees formed under the state APMC Acts and (ii) other markets  notified under the state APMC Acts. \xa0Such trade can be conducted in an  ‘outside trade area’, i.e., any place of production, collection, and  aggregation of farmers’ produce including: (i) farm gates, (ii) factory  premises, (iii) warehouses, (iv) silos, and (v) cold storages.\n* **Electronic trading:**\xa0The  Ordinance permits the electronic trading of scheduled farmers’ produce  (agricultural produce regulated under any state APMC Act) in the  specified trade area. \xa0An electronic trading and transaction platform  may be set up to facilitate the direct and online buying and selling of  such produce through electronic devices and internet. \xa0The following  entities may establish and operate such platforms: (i) companies,  partnership firms, or registered societies, having permanent account  number under the Income Tax Act, 1961 or any other document notified by  the central government, and (ii) a farmer producer organisation or  agricultural cooperative society.\n* **Market fee abolished:**\xa0The  Ordinance prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess  or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms for trade  of farmers’ produce conducted in an ‘outside trade area’.\n\n**The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020**\n\n* **Farming agreement:**\xa0The  Ordinance provides for a farming agreement between a farmer and a buyer  prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce. \xa0The minimum  period of an agreement will be one crop season, or one production cycle  of livestock. \xa0The maximum period is five years, unless the production  cycle is more than five years.\n* **Pricing of farming produce:**\xa0The  price of farming produce should be mentioned in the agreement. \xa0For  prices subjected to variation, a guaranteed price for the produce and a  clear reference for any additional amount above the guaranteed price  must be specified in the agreement. \xa0Further, the process of price  determination must be mentioned in the agreement.\n* **Dispute Settlement:**\xa0A  farming agreement must provide for a conciliation board as well as a  conciliation process for settlement of disputes. \xa0The Board should have a  fair and balanced representation of parties to the agreement. \xa0At  first, all disputes must be referred to the board for resolution. \xa0If  the dispute remains unresolved by the Board after thirty days, parties  may approach the Sub-divisional Magistrate for resolution. \xa0Parties will  have a right to appeal to an Appellate Authority (presided by collector  or additional collector)\xa0against decisions of the Magistrate. \xa0Both the  Magistrate and Appellate Authority will be required to dispose of a  dispute within thirty days from the receipt of application. \xa0The  Magistrate or the Appellate Authority may impose certain penalties on  the party contravening the agreement. \xa0However, no action can be taken  against the agricultural land of farmer for recovery of any dues.\n\n**The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020**\n\n* **Regulation of food items:**\xa0The  Essential Commodities Act, 1955 empowers the central government to  designate certain commodities (such as food items, fertilizers, and  petroleum products) as essential commodities. \xa0The central government  may regulate or prohibit the production, supply, distribution, trade,  and commerce of such essential commodities. \xa0The Ordinance provides that  the central government may regulate the supply of certain food items  including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils,  only under extraordinary circumstances. \xa0 These include: (i) war, (ii)  famine, (iii) extraordinary price rise and (iv) natural calamity of  grave nature.\n* **Stock limit:**\xa0The  Ordinance requires that imposition of any stock limit on agricultural  produce must be based on price rise. \xa0A stock limit may be imposed only  if there is: (i) a 100% increase in retail price of horticultural  produce; and (ii) a 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable  agricultural food items. \xa0 The increase will be calculated over the  price prevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or the average  retail price of the last five years, whichever is lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n  *Bill -*

When they asked bride's mother, she obviously suported her daughter saying that my friends was not a good match for her. \n       Now my friend has gone into depression speaking about suicide everyday. We are very afraid for him. Also, the thing is they are middle class family and they are afraid that bride would demand for money after divorce. They already spent a lot of money on marriage and hospital bills and are left with almost nothing.

Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions to work.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a Krishna conscious person is said to have burned up all reactions to work ?**\n\n.\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/sy8icm816vo51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=652d1e47c0af5a29a9e38d01b9bfb69046a75bb8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'iy6qls'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iy6qls/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is419/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'A small rant about not using Chinese goods'<br />Body: "(a fair warning, this might end up becoming an incoherent rant )\n\nAfter the whole Galwan incident, I've been trying to avoid Chinese stuff whenever possible and so far it's not going all that great. I'm frustrated and just want to vent.\n\nWhen it comes to the big stuff like phones, all the ones that are packed in features at a reasonable price are made by them. The quality/durability and after sales support are good too. Laptops are slowly going the same way. This is manageable to an extent, there are SOME alternatives.\n\nI'm actually more frustrated when it comes to the little stuff (not going to specifics) like electronic instruments and parts. The ones that are from Indian companies are comparatively expensive (by a factor of 2 or 3 even) while not offering any improvement in quality. At the very least, they could have better after-sales support, but no. They either are completely unhelpful, are rude or do not even respond. Also, I intentionally avoided saying Indian made because I'm not so sure about that at this point. You could find the exact same thing on Aliexpress with a label change. The stuff that you buy through them are like the bottom-of-the-barrel quality stuff, why not just cut the middle man and buy directly from China at a much lower price instead then? There's literally no value add, at the very least some amount of testing and after-sales support would help but no... that's not happening.\n\nSome things are outright not available anymore and no alternatives exists internally, some of the sellers on places like Amazon have listed these things with outrageous prices. \n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, the Chinese goods are competing on merit. Better quality, more features and lower cost. At this point, I think a ban would just allow Indian companies to dump subpar shit down our throats instead of producing something at least marginally better. \n\nLiterally the only reason you'll buy from the companies here is a (misplaced) sense of patriotism. All these days of prioritizing them has only caused me monetary loss for shit that doesn't even work that well. It feels like wasted money."<br />Author: 'CommonCantaloupe2'  id: 'iy6hsq'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iy6hsq/a_small_rant_about_not_using_chinese_goods/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The story of a bodyguard who died alone, saying that it was Salman behind the wheels till his last breath'<br />Body: "On December 10, the Bombay High Court acquitted actor Salman Khan, 13 years after a man named Nurullah Sharif was killed in a hit and run incident.\n\n  \n\n\nWhile dismissing the prosecution's case, Judge AR Joshi also dismissed the statement given by Mumbai police constable Ravindra Patil, and said he cannot be considered a 'wholly reliable witness'. The Mumbai sessions court in May 2015, had convicted the actor of killing one person and injuring four others in the 2002 hit-and-run case.\n\n  \n\n\nAt the time of the incident, Ravindra Patil was assigned to be Salman Khan's bodyguard, after the actor complained of threats from the underworld.\n\n  \n\n\nA 1998 batch constable, Patil consistently maintained until his death that he was sitting beside Khan when the latter ran over five sleeping pedestrians, one of whom succumbed to his injuries, in Bandra. When the conviction in May came, many people felt had been let down by the judiciary and the state. Patil, had been assigned as a bodyguard to the actor.\n\n  \n\n\nIt was Patil who lodged an FIR against Khan, and in his statement to the earlier court which heard the case, said he had warned the actor to drive slowly since he was in an inebriated condition. However, Khan did not heed the warning, Patil had said. Patil was reportedly under enormous pressure to change his statement against the actor and even went missing during the course of the trial. He had reportedly gone into hiding in order to avoid Khan's lawyers and also alleged harassment from within the police force.\n\n  \n\n\nIronically, Patil was arrested in 2006 for failing to appear as a witness and in November that year he was sacked from the force. Less than a year later, in August 2007, Patil was found on the streets near Sewri and admitted to hospital where he died in October. He had been suffering from tuberculosis for two years, and his family had abandoned him. Picture courtesy- BhadasMedia Mid-Day reported that Patil had told a friend two days before his death that he was saddened by the treatment he had been subjected to. “I stood by my statement till the end, but my department did not stand by me. I want my job back, I want to survive. I want to meet the police commissioner once.”\n\n  \n\n\nIt was two days before the 29-year-old bodyguard’s young friend Sushant Sawant, who had admitted Patil to the hospital. His signature was needed to release the body from the hospital. Mid-Day quoted Sawant as saying: “Patil was a good friend. He had taken me to meet Salman.”\n\n  \n\n\n[Source](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/story-bodyguard-who-died-alone-saying-it-was-salman-behind-wheel)"<br />Author: 'BullaKeepsItClosed'  id: 'iy5vkz'<br />Score:173<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iy5vkz/the_story_of_a_bodyguard_who_died_alone_saying/</li>

And other links about narcoterrorism funding terrorism in India."<br />Body: "https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/pakistan-khalistan-narco-terrorism-drugs-abuse/\n\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/pakistan-sponsored-narco-terror-is-form-of-asymmetric-warfare-against-india/articleshow/78201013.cms\n\nhttps://www.unodc.org/pdf/technical_series_1998-01-01_1.pdf\n\n&gt;Illicit crop cultivation is concentrated in certain areas, but frequently shifts within and\nsometimes between subregions and sometimes appears in areas where it was not previously given\nofficial cognizance. Most of the world's illicit opiates come from the countries of the Golden\nCrescent (Afghanistan, Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Pakistan), the Golden Triangle (Lao\nPeople's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Thailand), Lebanon and Mexico. \n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09700160108455325?journalCode=rsan20\n\n&gt;Afghanistan and Pakistan alone shared nearly 6000 metric tons of the total illicit production in 1999. It is a matter of serious concern to India, because these drugs are the major source for funding Pak‐sponsored terrorism in this country.\n\n\nhttps://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/resources/docs/ISPSW_639_Routray_D'Souza.pdf\n\n&gt;Proximity to the Golden Crescent, steady rise in domestic demand, and the thriving illicit networks’ ability to\nexploit the ungoverned spaces and porous borders are among the factors that are making India a new\ndestination of drugs from Afghanistan. The contraband is entering India both through land as well as the\nmaritime route. In this ‘nexus’ that has led to the growth of the drug trade, organized criminal networks,\nsmugglers, local policemen, and politicians are tied in a symbiotic relationship. The situation may have\nimproved marginally, according to the claims of the Indian authorities. However, to curb the growing trade\nand to break the ‘unholy nexus’ that sustains it, a regional counter-narcotics strategy combined with beefing\nup domestic laws and law enforcement capacities would be necessary. \n\n\nhttp://www.ipcs.org/comm_select.php?articleNo=1113\n\nConnection between Opium &amp; Maoist terrorism.\n\n&gt;People should have a look at the Ganja seizures stats in India. Most Ganja originates in the Andhra-Orissa border, dominated by the Naxalites, grown by forced labour. A prime source of income for the Maoist crooks. The economics is just not as simple as getting high on a joint.\n\n&gt;One of the major reasons for Ganja still being banned in India is this economics. Various central agencies (led by DRI) have had huge hauls of Ganja in recent years. This has broken the economic spine of Naxalism. Noone wants revolution on an empty stomach.\n\n&gt;Just google for Ganja seizures in India. Raids as far as UP/MP often have a connection leading back to the Agency area of Andhra or Koraput district in Odisha. If you think this entire domestic trade isn't benefitting the Maoists, you have surely lost the plot.\n\nSo for you urban college folk or twitter warriors, it's just a joint. Just weed.\n\n&gt;But in reality, it isn't. It's the way India has been battling (and quite successfully), its greatest internal security threat. The threat of Left Wing Extremism in the East of the country.\n\n&gt;The police/paramilitary actions you see in the front are just a part of the overt war. This is the other covert war, economic warfare where you starve your opponent to smoke them out. And Ganja raids are a big part of it. So think before you dismiss it as just a joint. The end.\n\n&gt;And even as we talk, my colleagues in DRI Bhubaneswar have seized 550 kilos of Ganja enroute to Bihar from AP Ganja Worth Rs 80 Lakh Seized From Vegetable-Laden Truck In Bhubaneswar\n\nhttps://odishatv.in/odisha-news/ganja-worth-rs-80-lakh-seized-from-vegetable-laden-truck-in-bhubaneswar-\n\nHere.

As Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he found that Allah had replaced Ishamel with a ram/lamb.\n\nThe practice that follows from thereon doesn't have any moral justification though. You are suppose love an animal (actually love it from the bottom of your heart), and then when the time comes, sacrifice it and eat it.\n\nYou can look at it in a thousand different ways but the flawed mentality is undeniable.\n\nEven when people defend this practice, they always draw examples from other religions and practices, say there's x thing happening in y religion as well, but never stand the ground on why the practice of sacrificing an animal after cherishing for an year is justified.\n\nIf a more logical and modern approach is followed towards sacrifice, majority of the people love themselves the most or at least  among other things people are worried about themselves as well. \n\nThey should simply donate blood on Eid-al-Adha.

On Sunday, France reported over 10,000 new cases while the UK reported 4,000. The WHO warned that a very serious situation was emerging in Europe, which is compounded by the fact that the previous lockdown had such a massive economic impact that doing it again could be difficult politically, with protests already erupting in Madrid.

At the same time, the PLAAF sent fighter jets close to Taiwan, beyond the half-way point in the Taiwan Straits, causing Taiwan to deploy an air defense missile system and scramble its own jets. This points to increased tension in the East China Sea, where the US has been conducting naval operations with two of its aircraft carriers.\n\n3. [Abraham Accords signed between Israel and UAE, Bahrain](https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/who-attended-the-abraham-accord-signing-1.1078316)\n\nIn a glitzy ceremony at the White House, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu (who is also the country\'s foreign minister) joined the foreign ministers of UAE and Bahrain to sign the historic peace deal - called the Abraham Accords - that would establish diplomatic ties between the countries for the first time, doubling the number of Arab countries with official ties to Israel. Marking that historic move, Saudi Arabia allowed an Israeli El Al flight to use its air space en route to Abu Dhabi. Previously, only Air India was allowed to fly over Saudi Arabia in flights to and from Israel. The presence of Bahrain - largely seen as a satellite state of Saudi Arabia - strongly implies that the latter is on board with the deal as well. Speculation is rife that Morocco and Sudan are also looking to recognize Israel.\n\n4. [TikTok and WeChat survive US ban, for now](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447702/tiktok-wechat-avoid-ban-china-trump-apps)\n\nOn Sunday, the US was all set to ban new downloads of popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat, over concerns that the apps were used for surveillance by the Chinese Communist Party. However, both survived the ban. TikTok\'s US operations will be owned partly by Walmart and Oracle in a deal that has the blessings of the White House, while a federal judge stayed a ban on WeChat. Oracle will host all of TikTok\'s US data locally. The WeChat issue is more complicated, as it is the only means of communication between American citizens of Chinese origin and their families back home in China, where virtually every other app is banned. \n\n5. [Rare sarcophagi found in Egypt](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54227282)\n\nIn a happy moment for human history, archaeologists in Egypt announced the discovery of a tomb with 27 sarcophagi dating back to about 2,500 years. Experts at the site, who had to climb down an 11 m deep well in difficult conditions (no heavy equipment is allowed at the site to avoid damaging it), say that the tomb seems to have been unopened since the sarcophagi were first buried. The tomb was uncovered in the town of Saqqara, south of the capital Cairo, which was an active burial ground in one of the ancient world\'s great civilizations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The CIA in Tibet\n\nWith tensions between India and China at the border reaching historic levels, there has been renewed discussion about Tibet. For over a thousand years, the plateau, often called the "roof of the world" for its height, was a Buddhist theocracy led by a religious figure, the Dalai Lama. The kingdom, like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, was a vassal state of the Chinese emperor, paying an annual tribute but not being directly administered by China. All that changed in 1950, when the PLA invaded and annexed Tibet, forcing the Dalai Lama to flee to India and bringing China\'s border right to the Indian subcontinent. \n\nFor two decades, the US through the CIA, the State Department, and the Department of Defense, ran operations in Tibet to prevent expansion of communism in the "autonomous region" and keep up hopes for an independent Tibet. In declassified documents, it has been shown that senior US administration members saw Tibet through two lenses: first, China\'s view that control of Tibet would give it a buffer zone in case western powers chose to invade China via India; and second, the American view that China and the Soviet Union would use Tibet as a staging ground to invade South and West Asia if necessary. In either case, an independent Tibet was considered the best means of maintaining status quo.\n\nThe CIA program in Tibet involved training armed Tibetan resistance fighters as well as spreading anti-Communist propaganda, and began when Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama\'s exiled brother, made contact with CIA operatives in India. At the height of the program, the CIA was spending almost $2 million a year. Fighters were trained both in the US as well as in a secret camp in the Nepal-Tibet border, and it is believed that it was these fighters that enabled the Dalai Lama to safely escape to India before he could be arrested by the PLA in 1959. Fighters also intercepted Chinese documents, proving to be a valuable source of intelligence into the world\'s most populous Communist-controlled country.\n\nThe Tibetan resistance was successful in holding back PLA forces in Tibet, who by 1960 numbered into tens of thousands and were facing huge costs and logistical challenges, but it led to the local civilian population facing harsh reprisals, including mass arrests and bombing of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. Declassified documents also showed that Indian Prime Minister Nehru opposed any anti-Communist activities in India, only willing to support the Dalai Lama\'s right to practice his religion but not Tibetan independence. The CIA program in Tibet came to an abrupt halt in 1972, after the historic visit of US President Richard Nixon to China and normalization of ties between the two countries. Fighters were allegedly given INR 10,000 to buy land or start a business in India, and all support to Tibet was halted by order of the White House. \n\nIn his 1991 autobiography, the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA for supporting Tibet not because they cared about Tibet, but merely as a pawn in the Cold War. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories from around the world caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'ix2w5u'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ix2w5u/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_abraham/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Midnight Adventure : Part II'<br />Body: "The only sound in the vicinity was of the exhaust, recoheting off the hills and the valley.\xa0 And truth to be told were somewhat comforting to the insidious stillness and cold of the surrounding. \n\nAfter an hour of uphill riding now I was descending down the hill. There were ploughed fields on the either side indicating presence of human establishment nearby. \n\nI stopped the bike near a big tamarind tree to check the maps. It was 09.30 pm and the map showed the village just further up ahead the road. It must be the same village whose lights I had seen from the hill. Slightly relieved being near civilization again after riding two hours through jungle, I started the bike feeling somewhat placated.\n\nAbout half a kilometre away from the village I came upon a bifurcation. The straight road lead to the village and the left one went towards the dam. \n\nI took the turn, as I rode further down the road I came to realise the dam wall was on the right side. Wondering if I could take the bike up on the wall I stopped to check on the maps whether I had an access. \n\nThe gates were situated on the opposite side of where I was. The gate side generally has entry points for the engineers to take their vehicles up on the wall for inspection.\n\nBut here the map showed no roads leading up to the dam. I guessed it must be recently constructed and it might have dirt roads or trails which might not show on the road maps. I switched to satellite mode and sure enough there was a dirt road till the front wall. But it meant circumventing the entire dam to reach the front with no roads. \n\nI had been riding for more than 2 hours on bad roads and the prospect of riding more in the cold was an unenviable proposition.\nBesides I doubted if there were guards, they would allow a stranger appearing at odd hours to just waltz in to the premises. \n\nI decided to try and climb the wall on the right. The wall was about 30 odd metres away from the road and lined with bubool trees. I spotted a clearing right up to the wall. I took the bike off the tarmac and rode through the clearing till the base. \n\nThe trees were dense, perhaps for being in contiguity of water. Through the headlamps of the bike, the thorny branches looked ominous. The moon was on the other side of the wall, shadowing the side in viscous darkness. \n\nThe wall must have been twenty or twenty five feet of slope without any parapet on the top, thankfully. Expecting no company I decided to leave the backpack on the bike and start the climb.\n\nThe entire wall was covered in grass. Few feet up on the slope suddenly my feet lost grip, I fell forward my palms searching for grip sliding down a few inches. I had failed to notice the thin layer of dew covering the grass in the inadequate light of my mobile flash.\n\nI pocketed the mobile and decided to climb up on all fours. Now in complete darkness, only thing I could see was the dark edge of the wall illuminated against the moon lit sky. \n\nSlipping a few times more I finally reached the end of the wall. Pulled myself up on the edge to be greeted with a scene which will remain with me till my dying breath. As I stood up dusting my clothes, lay the water with a pearly white sheen of moonlight reflecting upon it. There was silver mist touching the surface floating, gracefully dancing to the music of breeze. The moon was effulgent on top of a hill on the left, one of the many which lined the water body. \n\nCommitting every detail of the scene to the memory I stood there spellbound, only to be brought back by the bone chilling cold. Below the wall I was protected against the icy breezes, now fully exposed to the cold treatment I felt a shiver run through my arms. \n\nAfter clicking few photos for the proof of adventure, I stood there taking in the beauty, regretting the decision of leaving the back pack behind which had the shawl. \nThere was nothing to take shelter behind to avoid the breeze. The wall ran almost straight on the either sides. Even though the dam appeared small I could not spot where the wall turned. \n\nI had two options, either to climb back down to the bike, get the shawl and light a fire. But it meant denying myself this ethereal scene. And I didn't see myself climbing the wall again after the arduous evening. \n\nOr I could climb inside the dam which was lined with flat boulders. It wasnt much but it could provide a minor respite against the cold and allow me to stay a little longer. \n\nAnd the proposal was welcomed with open arms. I wasn't going to let the cold take my glory. The wall didnt have safety bars or a compound. And the slope was much gentle with the water being only few meters away from the top.\n\nI sat on the ground to let myself gradually climb down the rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be continued..."<br />Author: 'Albela__Sajan'  id: 'ix2lsy'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ix2lsy/the_midnight_adventure_part_ii/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Answers to some of the questions being raised after the passage of the Farm Bills 2020'<br />Body: "1) If MSP will stay why not write it in the bill?  \n\nBecause MSP has always been an administrative mechanism and NOT legislative. This allows flexibility to increase it as and when needed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) How will MSP be ensured in private transactions?   \n\nPrivate trade will be ABOVE rate of MSP. That is the whole point. Farmer will go to private people when they get rates MORE than MSP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Modi govt has weakened MSP.  \n\nLet the numbers speak. UPA in 2009-14 purchased 1.52 LMT pulses as MSP.  NDA in 2014-19 purchased 76.85 LMT at MSP. For oil seeds numbers are 3.65 and 30.17 LMT respectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4)Farmer will be trapped by contract.  \n\nEven after signing contract, farmer can withdraw anytime, without penalties, if no advance taken. If advance taken, return (no interest charged) then withdraw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Why such vociferous opposition?  \n\nBecause the middlemen will cut out. Example: MSP payment for entire country is on DBT mode except Punjab under Congress where they still use Arhatiyas middlemen!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) How will farmers deal with private industry?  \n\nThere will not be just one but thousands of private players to choose from. Competition by very nature kills monopoly of buyers(as exists now). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) Will farmers be able to protect their land?  \n\nSale, lease or mortgage of farmers land is prohibited. There will be just farming contract for specified products and specified time as per farmers choice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) How will the bills help?  \n\nInvestment, technology, economies or scale, modern equipment, better seeds, more crops, in-between-season crops, improved yields, better logistics and free access to markets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9) Collateral benefits from the bill? \n\nFarmer income (50% of India's workforce), thus rural income will significantly rise. This will boost demand for all kinds of goods and services which will in turn drive overall GDP growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10)So, how significant are these reforms?  \n\nSome say what 1991 did for industries, Farm Bills 2020 will do for agriculture. Some say it is even bigger - 1947 moment for farmers.  Every sector proves that when restrictions are removed Indians flourish. Now is the turn of farmers. \n\n[Credits](https://twitter.com/amishra77/status/1308003753828605953?s=20)"<br />Author: 'sbmohmayahai'  id: 'ix0gu8'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ix0gu8/answers_to_some_of_the_questions_being_raised/</li>

This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.\n\n.\n\nTo act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ikṣvāku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Kṛṣṇa consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.\n\n.\n\nIt is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharmaṁ hi sākṣāt-bhagavat-praṇītam. No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmā, Śiva, Nārada, Manu, Kumāra, Kapila, Prahlāda, Bhīṣma, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Yamarāja, Janaka, etc. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.\n\n.\n\n**Question : What is the best way of acting/doing work in Krishna consciousness?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7ej8wi93ho51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4012b59bff2ee248750cc5d5cfcd9aee4482dd89\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'iwxdnt'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iwxdnt/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is416/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Understanding the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple Judgement - Clear-cut with J. Sai Deepak'<br />Body: "&gt;Here is the link of the video on Youtube by Upword with J. Sai Deepak - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2B30mZmgwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2B30mZmgwM)\n\n`Transcript from the video pasted below; edited for ease of reading.`\n\n    Key takeaway - It is very clear that you've managed to achieve one of the perhaps more difficult outcomes, coming from the community you come from. Imagine in modern, secular, republican, whatever India, the right of a royal family with respect to a temple, based and rooted in Hindu tradition has been accepted in 2020. So given the Mahaul and the atmosphere that we live in, I would ask myself let us be a bit realistic and learn to celebrate one of the few achievements that we get.\n\n* **Genesis of the case** \\- It all starts with the eviction proceeding of a tenant, so a practicing advocate who was a tenant on a premises owned by the temple, was asked to vacate the premises in 2009 by the then executive officer. The tenant refused to and challenged the authority of the executive officer on the ground that his own appointment as executive officer was illegal, because the person who appointed him as the executive officer lacked the authority to do so under law. \n* **So in response to an eviction proceeding, the gentleman files a writ petition before the Kerala High Court in 2009, on the grounds that the royal family does not fall within the definition of ruler**, for the purposes of the travancore-cochin Hindu religious institutions Act of 1950, which effectively governs temples in Kerala. According to him it was the 26th **amendment of the Constitution in 1971,** when royal titles and other let's say privileges were abolished, the concept of a ruler effectively became infructuous, redundant and therefore any power or privilege enjoyed by the Travancore royal family with respect to the Padmanabhaswamy temple came to an end. According to him, either in 1971 or at the very least after the death of the signatory to the original covenant, between the Travancore princely state and the indian union, who passed away in 1991, which is the legendary king of the Travancore princely state; our balarama varma who was known as the walking Vishnu or dasa so to speak of.\n* Along with this, other civil suits were filed in various other courts alleging temple mismanagement, which in most cases are by people propped up.\n* In 2010, Sri Martand Verma, approaches the High Court saying all these suits the civil suits and various courts must be transferred to the High Court because ultimately the central question in all these proceedings was whether they continue to have any authority and whether the 26th amendment made difference to their relationship with the temple.\n\n*So all the petitions are clubbed together by the Kerala High Court and results in a judgment of the Kerala High Court, which comes out on the 31st of January 2011. In which, the Kerala High Court basically says, that any privilege enjoyed or any position enjoyed by the ruler of Travancore who originally signed the covenant in May 1949, on behalf of the princely states of travancore and cochin on the one hand and the Indian Union on the other, ended with his demise in 1991 and in any case post the abolition of Privy Purse in 1971, thanks to the 26th amendment there is no concept of a ruler. Since, everywhere in the act with respect to the Padmanabhaswamy temple the word ruler has been used and the word ruler has become useless, therefore none of his successors would have any rights with respect to the temple. That was basically the position.*\n\n    Therefore the simple question was this whether the use of the word ruler in the act in the travancore-cochin Hindu religious institutions Act of 1950 was it with reference to an individual or was it with reference to an office therefore if it's an individual then it ends with the signatory of the Covenant of 1949 but if it's with reference to an office then the successors get rights as well.\n\n*So, Kerala High Court rules that it was it ended with the life of the previous ruler which is in 1991. It passes detailed directions facilitating the takeover of the temple, its assets and management by the state government of Kerala through a Trust which is created by the state government of Kerala. It also directed opening of all the vaults of the temple, which were held to be sacred and never opened, at least some of the vaults and for every article in each of the vaults to be inventoried and put out for public display in a museum on a payment basis so that people, tourists and the general public can visit the temple to look at that, on the payment of a fee, so effectively what those articles which we effectively treat as articles of darshan had become articles of pradarshan. That is the consequence of the Kerala High Court judgment.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**It is against that judgment that the royal family approached the Supreme Court in 2011.** A stay was granted by the Supreme Court on day one and pending the disposition of the entire matter the court put in place certain committees which would administer and govern this particular temple in the interim so to speak and that is the proceeding which has ultimately resulted in the judgment of 13th of July 2020 where the court has finally come to the conclusion that the high court's judgment was patently erroneous, incorrect and certainly flew in the face of the history of the Covenant, the spirit behind the protection given to this particular family especially in the travancore-cochin Act of 1950**. So that's basically the sum and substance of the legal outcome.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A direction of a secular institution which effectively strips a religious institution of its sanctity and all of that is sanctified in a judicial order, and the entire religious institution is assigned and handed over to a so called secular institution or a secular body is unimaginable** even as let's say a practitioner of Constitution or at the very least a believer of constitutional. You don't need to be person who believes either in religion or in hinduism to arrive at this basic reasonable conclusion, that on the face of it, the directions of the kerala high could transgressed perhaps all canons of reasonableness, all canons of expectations of fairness with respect to treatment of fundamental freedoms of religious nature both individual and institutional, because this was not just a question of one family of the temple, crores and crores of people across the world believe in lord Padmanabhaswamy and the temple is the object of worship and faith and respect and whatnot.\n\n# So, what are the positives from the judgement - A legal view.\n\n* **The entire relationship between the royal family and the temple** is based on a specific instrument, a document. The document is the covenant, signed between the rulers of the princely states of travancore and cochin the merged state, after the independence of course on the one hand and the Indian Union on the other. The Indian Union was represented by Mr. VP Menon, the right-hand man of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who worked with him for integration of States, who was doing the negotiations with all the princely states rulers.\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    What was this covenant is all about? \n    \n    So once you sign the Instrument of Accession saying I wish to be a part of Bharat you have entered into a couple of more agreements to protect a couple of your interests and your rights. Now the document which we are referring to earlier it is the Covenant. Now that document was not entered into separately by travancore and cochin, a single document was entered into on behalf of both the princely states because by then both the state had merged to become the travancore-cochin state.\n    \n    Central feature; of this document which is relevant to the case is a provision called article 8, is what captures the Covenant or the let's say the promise made by the Indian Union to the ruler of the Travancore family that their rights and their control over the management of the Padmanabhaswamy temple shall not be interfered with, not just in his lifetime but also to his successors. The rest of the temples form part of the Travancore Devaswom Board, which is all the temples in Travancore and cochin but this particular temple falls under the exclusive domain of the ruler of Travancore. Just as the three major temples of Kerala have special relationships with different families and this family (Travancore) has a special relationship with the Padmanabhaswamy temple, that's what the Covenant recognizes. \n\n*So this happens in May 1949, they sign this particular document in 1950, the HRC legislation of Kerala which is the travancore-cochin Hindu religious institutions Act of 1950 comes about and there's a specific chapter of this particular Act which is chapter 3 sections 18 to 23, the chapter itself is called Shri Padmanabhaswamy temple.*\n\n* Here, in the structure, the Rajah so to speak, has the right and the power to appoint a three-member committee and there is an executive officer as well whose appointed by the rajah. All of them aid the Raja in the discharge of his functions towards the administration of the temple. \n\nThat is the structure as it exists in the act and there has been no amendment to that particular portion of the Act either after 1950 and till date it remains as is. Various multiple amendments have been undertaken to the act overall but this particular chapter remains unchanged even after the abolish of the privy purses in 1971, even after the death of the first ruler or let's say the covenant ruler in 1991, nothing has changed as far as this chapter is concerned. \n\nSo the state government which says that, they (royals) have lost rights undertakes amendments with respect to the rest of the Act, but never touches this particular chapter, meaning thereby they understand that this is protected by the Covenant. \n\n* **Now what has happened today is that the Supreme Court recognizes that this entire act or let's say this chapter of the Act, if that is Ganga, the Gangotri is the Covenant** and the relationship which is recognised in the Covenant is a special relationship where the Travancore family is like a saywayath which is the earthly custodian and representative of the deity, that is the relationship between them and that particular relationship is not the product of a British title. So abolition of Privy Purses in 1971 can take away all of the titles but not this relationship which has pre-existed them even before the concept of British came about for all practical purposes. \n* **So therefore the court says this particular relationship stands unaffected** by the abolition of Privy purses in 1971 and that the right that was given under Article 8 was not limited to the signing ruler so to speak or that particular ruler who was alive at that particular point of time but also his successors that is the primary finding.\n\n# Why is this important?\n\nEvery other royal family which has its own temple would have entered into a covenant of similar nature where its rights with respect to its institution would have been protected. But unfortunately, over a point of time the indian state or its representatives have managed to go back on their obligations with respect to this right. The abolition of the Privy Purses itself was going back on what is promised. \n\n# Therefore what is the long-term application of this particular judgment?\n\nSimilarly placed temples and similarly placed royal families can agitate in a similar manner for a similar outcome. There are a number of temples across the country which are similarly placed or almost similarly placed, you can't call them identical. Mysore, Ekling ji in mewar, lot of other places. \n\n# What happens to the current administrative structure which seems to be the primary point of discussion everywhere?\n\nThere were three sets of proposals broadly that were placed before the court. \n\n* ONE proposal went from the royal family itself. \n* ONE proposal came from the state government and \n* One proposal went from us the intervenors. \n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    The court has for all practical purposes accepted the proposal of the ruler in entirety. Almost, except with one or two changes. \n\n# What is the structure that has been proposed?\n\n**There is an existing Advisory Committee now you have two committees. The Advisory Committee which is the committee recognized under the Act has three people as usual. In addition to that, there is an administrative committee which has five people now.** \n\n# Who are the three people who are the five people? Where is this interference coming from?\n\n1. Under the Advisory Committee you effectively have a retired judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court who shall be a member of that particular committee.\n2. Then you have someone who's nominated by the ruler \n3. And the third person is a reputed Chartered Accountant who's nominated by the retired judge but in consultation with the ruler \n\n*So this is the three-member committee.*\n\n**Then you have the administrative committee.** \n\n1. The Rajah had basically proposed that the first person shall be a retired IAS officer of the rank of the secretary from the government of Kerala which the court has replaced with the district judge.\n2. Followed by a nominee of the ruler\n3. Followed by a nominee of the Ministry of Culture, Union ministry of culture\n4. Followed by a nominee of the state government \n5. A reputed chartered accountant or something of that sort.\n\n*So totally there are about five people.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Now the fear that has been floated in a couple of circles is: you have a state government nominee, you have a central government nominee, and you have a couple of retired judges sitting here and also presiding judges sitting here. This is effectively a backdoor to facilitate government entrenchment or establishment entrenchment.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;By recognizing the rights of the rajah on the one hand and still creating a backdoor entry on the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you look at the Act, it clearly says that the administrative committee which is now replacing the executive officer who was previously appointed by the rajah shall be under the control and supervision of the ruler that is what the provision says.\n* Second the Advisory Committee shall advise the rajah with respect to the discharge of his functions so one committee is under the supervision and control, the other shall only advise.\n\n**Now, let's apply our logic if you are effectively recognized that article 8 is valid and article 8 speaks of his (rajah) dominion over this particular temple, can it be the court's conclusion that I will uphold his rights on one hand like this and on the other hand I will dilute it by creating committees which can override and prevail over his let's say supremacy so to speak? Not Possible, that's what logic says I don't know what are the forms of logic are Possible.**\n\nBut the other thing is the Act expressly states that under section 18, that particular entity which performs the role of the executive officer, which is the Administrative Committee, shall be under the control and supervision of the ruler. And as far as section 20 is concerned the Advisory Committee shall only advise the discharge of the Functions. \n\nSo according to me this is like a telescope, \n\n* at the top is the ruler\n* then comes the Advisory Committee\n* then comes the administrative committee.\n\n# What is it that people are not telling you? In the judgment the court goes on to say further that in matters of policy relating to the fundamental character of the temple it shall be the ruler who has the final say.\n\nWhat are those issues that the court actually identifies; five specific issues\n\n1. Any monthly expenditure\n2. One-time expenditure over 1 crore you have to take the permission of the ruler\n3. Any expense item which is over 15 lakhs\n4. Any expansion\n5. Or renovation of the temple \n\nYou have to ask the ruler not just ask, you need his approval. (para numbers 47 page number 100 take a look at Roman number 11 that's what it says)\n\n**What the court also says that any aspect of the administration which changes the fundamental character of the temple insofar as religious sentiments are concerned it will be the Raja who is the final authority and with respect to all the vaults and treasures that people wanted to open, the discretion is left to the committees. But as I said, the committee's are operating under the Raja, &amp; the Raja is bound with the tradition I rest my case.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What do you make make of the negativity that has surrounded this issue?\n\nI'm not saying certainly that everything is hunky-dory. I am certainly still of the opinion the court could have avoided populating this particular body with state representatives and that is where we had raised a couple of arguments.\n\nUnfortunately, the court said that those arguments were never raised before the High Court. The basic point is in fact,\n\n&gt;I'll quote you here we must perhaps not master the art of pulling defeat from the intestines of  victory, that is something that we must not do. Because I am asking myself this simple question. Draw heart from the fact that the other side is seething, the other side is lost and the other side is effectively saying everything that have managed to get from the Kerala High Court in the first judgment I've lost it.\n\nEffectively everything is gone right so there is no question of touching the treasures of the temple because that's sacred property that's not supposed to be touched. The fundamental relationship between the family and the temple has been restored and the control of the ruler over the administration of the temple for all practical purposes has been restored with adequate safeguards. \n\n**So where is the problem?**\n\n*The problem is in twofold, these are let's call it footnotes for all practical purposes.*\n\n* *The first footnote, is that we had effectively raised the argument that the temple is a denominational temple as well as a Vaishnava temple. Under Article 26 and the relationship between the family in the temple is also protected by article 25 -1 so please recognize that. We placed volumes of literature, the court merely said this is for the very first time that any party is raising an article 25 and 26 argument in the facts of this case it was never raised before the High Court.* \n* *Now the court has chosen not to entertain the particular argument. It has not rejected the argument, it says I don't need to get into the issue because I'm arriving at the same conclusion through article 8 anyways, so I don't need to get into this academic issue at this particular point in time that's what has happened.*\n\n# So does this judgment paves the way for the freedom of the temples all across the Country?\n\n*See there are specific examples where this model can be considered.* \n\n* *So for instance if you look at the manner in which the TTD is run, under Section 96 of the HRC act of Andhra Pradesh of 1987 it is populated entirely by people appointed by the state. So when you look at that structure and when you look at this structure this is better.*\n* *You look at the structure which currently applies to the temples in Uttarakhand where Dr. Swamy is the only person to have actually challenged that particular Jotham act where the government there, the state government, has taken over more than 51 temples, this structure is better than that structure,*\n* *This structure is also better than the structure that currently applies to the Sri Jagannath temple because the Sri Jagannath temple administration committee under Section 5 of the HT is Jagannath temple act of 1955, again is a government appointed board. It's a government appointed committee compared to that kind of deep entrenchment of the state in those major temples, what are we really talking about here..* \n\n**But can this be applied to every other temple I would be very circumspect and grounded in my extrapolation of that to the extent that the court is willing to recognize a special relationship which is rooted in tradition and which is a religious relationship. It is a welcome sign that today Indian courts recognized religious relationship which is Hindu in nature and character and which still also believes that the rights of control can reside in these royal families based on the facts and circumstances and the special relationship that the family enjoys with the temple.** \n\nSo, from a big-picture perspective it is effectively a positive sign. It may not be a giant leap, it is perhaps a miniscule step, but for this temple it's a giant leap compared to where it was in 2011.\n\nFor similarly placed temples this could perhaps at least start as the starting point of a discussion if not the ideal end.\n\n# For temples that do not really have a ruler, history of the Raja or the priestly kingdom behind them. How do those temples, we often talk about freedom of temples from state, which have government control, what replaces it? (the management structure)\n\n**The basic point is if we subscribe to the concept of Sampradaya under hindu tradition it is possible to argue that over 70% of Hindu temples are sampradaya temples**. Therefore they must enjoy the rights of autonomy available under Article 26. Which means members of the sampradaya should fight for populating the administrative bodies of that particular temple, fight for the ouster of state officials from that particular temple and they must initiate proceedings on the ground.\n\nHowever all of this can begin that is what is called the denominational state. What is the denominational status? the denominational status is a fairly powerful tool to prevent encroachment of the autonomy of the religious institution by the state and therefore the first goal is to prove that you are in the form of a denomination.\n\n    For a moment let's assume that you're not even a denomination. In principle, the argument can't be that it is state-controlled which is the default and community control which is the alternative because that is not what is said by article 25 as well. So article 25.2a only limits itself to the state's role to supervise. It's a supervisory role that the state performs, it is not an administrative role. You can't take over the entire process. Again here, Dr. Swamy's judgment from the state of Tamil Nadu, the judgement of January 2014 is a landmark judgement on this particular issue. Where thanks to dr. Swami's efforts and others, this particular law was laid down by justice BS Jahan and justice bobde, was not the current chief justice, so the law as well as the remedy with respect to denominational temples and nondenominational temples is fairly clear\n\n**Unfortunately the clarity has not percolated to public awareness to a significant extent. A lot of us have to take the responsibility for not, let's say explaining this particular issue to the public in a language they understand or maybe we have we've been too caught up in our own legalities to explain it to them.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**But the answer exists in law. Let's say the position of communities which are in a position to establish the denominational status is slightly better, that even without the denominational temple the state has a certain laxman rekha which the Constitution has drawn for itself, that is the Laxman Rekha that you must insist on, in principle as long as you stick to that and you don't budge from that particular position, denomination or other ways is a second issue that comes much later.**\n\n# What I am is different but where you are supposed to be is the first question, so stay out. (secularism)\n\n**After this huge historic win, what next? where do you see this entire movement going towards?**\n\n* There has been a lot of negativity from people. I'm more than happy to accept that this is not a hundred percent ideal outcome as I said earlier but there is a lot to draw a heart from and hope from.\n* If we want to convince ourselves that we are destined to be defeated always and that we are destined to lose always I am sorry. Man can't put in what God has not, that's your problem.\n* But as someone who means business and was clear about how this thing could perhaps be achieved and what are the legal remedies available, where we have so many people working with us people who matter and people who take it very seriously, who committed to this are working with us we know for a fact that there's a lot to build on from this particular judgment at least with respect to similarly placed temples.\n\n*Any case it tells the community please try and put some faith in this particular process. We are trying to take a shot at a certain edifice which has not work for you all these decades, now it has started showing results so don't be disheartened. If you choose to be disheartened you do it at your own peril and to your own detriment, nobody else stands to lose anything, you do.*\n\n**Pessimism is a luxury that Hindus can afford. You have no other option but to be optimistic and perseverant. Keep attacking, keep getting the job done.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/end\n\nNote: Again, this post is a transcript from the video (linked at start above), and aimed to create a discussion and awareness amongst public in regards to Freedom of Hindu Temples from state."<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'iwexv6'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iwexv6/understanding_the_sri_padmanabhaswamy_temple/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Best Money Transfer Service in Rural Area'<br />Body: "**We have time and again written about our merchants and how they are the agents of change in their locality, inspiring the masses and enabling them through various digital services and promoting the benefits of the same. In our blogs, we have already mentioned about our products like EBIGSHOP and how it has been equipping the retailers with cardinal services and earn substantial benefit from them.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[India's Best AEPS and Money Transfer Portal, Best Service, Best Support](https://preview.redd.it/rg0wb5et5ao51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6429c91bc37ae19096f53189314d37ba4e6a9cc)\n\nOut of all the services mentioned in our previous blogs, EBIGSHOP Merchant’s DMT and recharge services have been one of our oldest services. A few years back when the digital transactions were unsettled and open to discussion, it was the Money transfer services that helped people transfer money to any corner of the country. To put into simple words, Domestic Money Transfer is a service offered by various companies/agencies to transfer money from one account to another account within the country. The end customer first deposits the required amount to the DMR agent (Domestic money remittance) The money, received by the DMR agent, is transfer processed using National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and Immediate Payment service (IMPS) technology to the receiver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere has been continuous migration of people in search of growth and better opportunities, thus concentrating the population in the cities. Majority of them are unaware of the technology to transfer money via internet banking and banks become the only option for them to transfer money to their family. Now, since they work on a day to day basis and as contract labourers, they can’t afford to spare one day of work and wait hours in queues of banks for cash deposit or fund transfer. It was in these scenarios that the DMT services helped to solve the problem of money transfer within the country for these migrants who worked as daily wage workers to send money to their hometown. Now they don’t need to stand hours waiting in the bank to send money, with the help of a money transfer agent he can transfer money to their family instantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe aim to provide retailers with digital, financial and business solutions such that each small business and retail store can use technology to expand their business offerings. Want to know more? Register today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the very start, the DMT services always had a very wide scope because of its comparatively cheap and reliable nature. It helped to transfer money to anywhere in India in a very short time. It is also a much-secured pathway for the same. With the advent of technology and digitalisation, the DMT services were then transformed from desktop-centric to mobile screen-centric. One of the major advantages of this service for its end customer is that it doesn’t require the sender to have a bank account. Thus it becomes available to both banked and unbanked population We have been enabling our retailers to provide this service to their customers and also avails retailer with an opportunity to increase their income.  We have been empowering these masses to use these services and experience seamless transactions. It is this model of money transfer that brings the transaction touch-point closer to this set of customers that is available even at non-banking hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, through its various products and services, EBIGSHOP is trying to empower the unorganised retailers by equipping them with a platform to provide various services like domestic money transfer, AEPS, mPOS, utility, bill payments, online mobile recharges and many more at one place. EBIGSHOP platform works in unison with the retailers, products and services, distributors and the last mile customers towards creating value at every touch point."<br />Author: 'ebigshop'  id: 'iwbkr7'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iwbkr7/best_money_transfer_service_in_rural_area/</li>

As her engine purred to life I felt like revving it hard as always, but college premises had ears and watchmen had mouth to complain about you, so saner minds prevailed as I set off towards my apartment. \n\nThe two bhk apartment was a cozy thing compared to the cheaper and netherworldly boys hostel.\n\nI opened the gate of my room, golden light was streaming through the venetian blinds, I threw my bag on the table and crashed on the bed.\n\nNot being particularly tired and having nothing to look forward to for the weekend was an unpleasant predicament.\n\nAs I stared at the slow moving fan one random neuron remembered a friend telling me about a dam near a village he saw on a medical camp he had attended. \n\n"That\'s it"\n\nWhipped out the phone put in the name of the village in google maps and sure enough there was a small dam near it.\n\nI hit the directions icon and it showed traveling time of 3 hours. Even though it was only 70 km away the bad roads and ghat section made longer to reach.\n\nMobile showed 4.20 pm. \n\nIf I were to start the journey then and there I would reach the dam by 7.30 by which time sunlight would be gone, given it was winter time and there would be nothing left to see then.\n\nSurely riding at dawn was a much more sensible option.\n\nIt must have been a poorly developed neuron which chimed in with \'this is what an adventure is broh\'.\n\nThe thought got embraced open heartedly. It had stirred the inner adventurer within, who hadnt withered the tribulations which entailed an adventure. It still had not sprouted the wisdom tooth.\n\nSo the plan was to take a shower, grab tea from the regular tapri, ride the 30 km highway section, grab dinner from one the dhabas, go to the dam and spend the night there, watch the sunrise and come back with a merry adventure to tell.\n\nFirst things first, I took the shower. Grabbed the back pack. Army rolled a shawl, a small mattress, an inflatable pillow in it. Put the earphones and power bank in the front pocket. \n\nPut my trusted kershaw foldable knife in my back pocket. Donned the old brown leather riding jacket, gloves and the helmet. \n\nWore the back pack, ready to storm out, almost forgot the water. Filled the water bottle, had a final checking look inside the apartment and stepped out. \n\nAs always before long rides I had to check the oil, fuel, brake fluid and tyre pressure. \n\n"All good, lets go"\n\nRevved the bike up to my hearts content and set out for the first destination, *chai tapri*.\n\nChai was good as always. Asked the guy for a lighter. \n\n__*"Arre bhaiya app kab se shuru kar diye?"*__\nHe had never seen me smoke so it was only a\n natural inquisition. \n\n__*"Cigarette k liye nahi hai, agg lagani hai"*__\n*(Not for cigarette, its to set fire)*\n\n__*"Kisko?"*__\n*(To whom)*\n\n__*"Duniya ko"*__\n*(The world)*\n\nDoing random blathering like this was a regular sport at the chat tapri. I bid him adieu and checked the maps. \n\nThe turn I had to make for the village had many dhabas or hotels nearby. \n\nIt meant for the stretch of 30 km I had no turns to take or any stops. I checked the watch, it was 6.00 pm. \n\nThe chill had started to settle as I set off to the next destination.\n\nBy 7 o clock I had reached the the turn, it was already dark. I parked the bike in front of a dhaba. Sat on one of the *khaats*, a cot made with cast iron angles and plastic rope interweaved and ordered the dinner.\n\nTen minutes later they brought copious amount of food for the amount of money which couldnt even get you a big mac.\n\nAfter filling myself to the brim with a very tasty dinner it was time to go. Darkness had completely taken over and the chill had increased significantly. \n\nI mounted the bike and took the left turn towards the village. The road immediately turned out to be in a very poorly maintained condition.  It was a one way road with an upward incline.\n\nThe maximum speed that I could reach, before jangling my joints loose, was 30 kmph. As I was riding up the temprature had started to drop drastically. \n\nTheres wasnt a single soul in sight and with the tall trees on either side, the beam of my headlight was giving an effect of entering a gigantic dark cave.\n\nAfter a while I reached a clearing and the clouds gave way for the full moon. I realised this must be the backwaters as there was water on either sides of the road.  With hills at the banks of the water body and moon light shining on both sides it was a sight I had not seen even in beautiful paintings.\n\nAs I rode further I reached a steep incline going round the hill. I was greeted with a mesmerising view of vast expanse of the land below, on the other side of the hill, with everything till the horizon was bathed in milky light of the moon. I could see lights from a distant village, assuming it must be the same village I rode further. \n\n\n\nTo be continued...'<br />Author: 'Albela__Sajan'  id: 'ivx132'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ivx132/the_midnight_adventure/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Explained: The Opposition's hue and cry over the Farm Bills."<br />Body: 'With the three farm bills which will free the Indian agriculture from the jaws of Nehruvian socialism, the Modi government has done an irreversible damage to future prospects of Congress and many regional parties. The farmers were the biggest ‘vote bank’ for many regional parties such as Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana, NCP in Maharashtra and so on.\n\nMost of these political parties have colonized the farmers with a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which is as following: These parties kept the farmers deliberately away from market so that they are dependent on Agriculture Market Produce Committee (APMC)- which charge colossal fee ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent- to sell their produce.\n\nAlso, their government earned thousands of crore rupees in taxes from the APMCs. So, a farmer sells say onion at 10 rupees per kg in mandi, now- the trader takes his/her commission, the government collects its taxes, the trader and retailer adds their profit, and finally the onion that the farmer sold at 10 rupees per kg to trader goes to consumer at 20-30 rupees per kg.\n\nThe money the government collects from these APMCs in taxes is used to give free power, subsidized seeds, and farm loan waivers to the farmers. In short, the money collected from farmers is given back to farmers (but not all the money because corrupt bureaucrats also get their share from the allotment) but with the stamp of charity from the government.\n\nIn FY 20, the Punjab government [earned](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/experts-warn-agri-reforms-to-take-away-big-share-of-punjab-revenue-from-mandis-6446639/) as much as 3642 crore rupees by taxing agriculture produce and later used that money to subsidies power, seed, and fertilizer and in loan waivers.\n\nThe regional parties and in some states the governments, buy the ‘vote bank’ of farmers through this charity, for which they have collected the money from farmers themselves. These parties hold farmers and their votes for ransom and fool them by masquerading as ‘messiah of farmers’.\n\nThe [bills ](https://www.financialexpress.com/market/central-law-removing-mandi-tax-traders-mandi-operators-spar-call-for-bandh/2061044/)being pushed by the Modi government- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Amendment to 1955 Essential Commodities Act- would free the farmers from the grasp of traders, bureaucrats, politicians and the government.\n\nOnce the country has a well-functioning agriculture market, which is set to happen in next two-three years if these bills get passed in Rajya Sabha and becomes an Act, the political capital built by parties like SAD, INLD, NCP over the decades will be decimated in no time. And, this is the reason that these parties are opposing the farm sector reforms acts tooth and nail.\n\nOnce these bills become law, the farmer will be able to sell the produce anywhere in the country and the monopoly of APMCs will end. As of now, a farmer who is producing some crop in X district can sell it in APMC of that district only which means ‘monopoly’ of the APMCs controlled by local politicians.\n\nThe development of a nationwide market will not only benefit the farmer but the consumer, too. The price of wheat, rice, or lentil in cities is two to three times higher than that to villages but once a nationwide market is developed, the prices throughout the country will be similar to a large extent.\n\nMoreover, the farmers will not have to be dependent on Minimum Selling Price (MSP)- which has become Maximum Selling Price for most of the crops- for better price realization. MSP also benefits the traders and big farmers, not the small and poor ones; so reduction in reliance on MSP will also help the farmers.\n\nTherefore, these bills will jeopardize the political parties like NCP, SAD, INLD which have colonized the farmer; will harm the corrupt bureaucrats; but help the farmers, especially the small and marginal ones, in better price fulfillment.'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'ivuj7v'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ivuj7v/explained_the_oppositions_hue_and_cry_over_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Need help guys'<br />Body: "Hello people of r/IndiaSpeaks, I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't this drunk or this scared, but here I am, asking people on the internet for help on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nSo I'll just get to the point. \n\nIts a sunny Saturday noon and i meet up with my significant other and we decided to get a lil tipsy because why not?  It was a good road trip and towards the end things got a lil heated up as they usually do.\n\nSo there's this apartment near our place, its a govt thing, like a railway officers colony or something, and its really clean and somehow really secluded(or so we thought) and its the perfect place for us to just park the car and chill. So we did. But today, when i looked back I saw two uncles making a video of my car from behind, and they obv have the car number and all now. \n\nI'm sure they did not get to see anything we were doing in the car, but I am just really scared about them having my number plate details, I mean the car is registered on my fathers name and it would suck if the po pos call him up and I just don't want to go through something like that right now.\n\nSO. What can happen to me? has anything like this ever happened to anyone and if yes, how did you get out of such a sticky situation?"<br />Author: 'Shizzleupdizzleup'  id: 'ivqcgo'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ivqcgo/need_help_guys/</li>
