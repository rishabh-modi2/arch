I don't want someone to project their opinion on me. the current media is enough for that. It should not be left wing or right wing supporting or opposing.\n3) it should not only be focusing on politics. but rather, A bit of everything.. I mean science and research, sports, world news if possible, art .\nI have no interest in bollywood and entertainment..so  I don't care about this. \n4) Lastly, it preferably should be convenient to read.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL Rajiv Gandhi ‘mulled’ gifting Tawang to China'<br />Body: '&gt;In his bid to emerge as a global leader, Rajiv visited China in 1988. On his arrival at Beijing on December 19, 1988, Rajiv Gandhi declared: “I have come to renew our old friendship…and border is negotiable.”\n\n&gt;Rahul’s father Rajiv Gandhi, as prime minister, had contemplated giving away parts of Arunachal Pradesh, including Tawang, to the Chinese as a trade-off for ‘permanent peace’ on the border. But for strong opposition from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Pranab Mukherjee and George Fernandes, he might have sealed the deal. In this context, it must be mentioned here that it was Rahul’s great-grandfather, Nehru, who had famously said ‘not a blade of grass grows there’ in response to Chinese occupation of ‘huge chunks’ of Indian territory in Aksai Chin.\n\xa0\nDuring discussions with Opposition parties, Rajiv Gandhi tried to drive home that it was in India’s interest to reach a compromise with the Chinese (even at the cost of a few kilometers of land). Moreover, he wanted to bring about a general consensus in the country on his peace plan. In one of the meetings with leaders of opposition parties, he is reported to have said: “The McMahon Line was drawn by a ‘thick pen’ on a small-scale map.” This meant that Rajiv Gandhi was game for border alignment variations, as the thickness of McMahon Line on the map implied lack of ‘firmness and definiteness’ on the ground.\n\n\nExcept for a few Chinese stooges and Communists, Rajiv Gandhi’s pro-China policy found few takers from the opposition side. Pranab Mukherjee, who was expelled from the Congress, had vowed to fight Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘surrenderist policy’ in Arunachal Pradesh. The Janata Party came down heavily on Rajiv Gandhi for casting doubts on the McMahon Line. In unequivocal terms, the Janata Party said: “The border between India and China was not a thick line drawn on small-scale map but a clearly demarcated international frontier, which was transgressed by the Chinese.”\n\xa0\nBJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was then a member of the Foreign Affairs Consultative Committee, had made even a more serious allegation. Vajpayee said the External Affairs Minister had cancelled a very crucial meeting of the Committee because the government had prior information that the Chinese had decided to attack India in Arunachal Pradesh. During Vajpayee’s regime, the Chinese were told categorically that the Chinese proposal on Arunachal Pradesh was neither practical nor possible and it wanted China to hand over Aksai Chin to India.\n\xa0\nRajiv Gandhi’s plan to build a consensus in favour of his ‘China deal’ fizzled out in the face of public outrage. However, China continued to mount pressure on New Delhi to part with some areas in the east through its retainers and influencers in the pro-China lobby. “…when Kuldeep Nayar was told in Beijing that India must make concessions in the east to settle the border problem, he frankly expressed his fear that no government in Delhi could stay in power if it ever conceded anything in the east,” writes Charan Shandilya, a pro-China lobbyist.\n\n\nhttps://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2020/9/7/Rajiv-Gandhi-mulled-gifting-Tawang-to-China.html'<br />Author: 'its_my_36th_account'  id: 'ivof2c'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ivof2c/til_rajiv_gandhi_mulled_gifting_tawang_to_china/</li>

Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty in this divine consciousness.\n.\n.\nPURPORT\n.\nThere are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kṛṣṇa consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Arjuna's desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord's previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvān, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of Lord Kṛṣṇa are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by Kṛṣṇa.\n.\nQuestion 1 : What advice did the Lord give to Arjuna in this verse?\n.\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : Bhagavad Gita Multilingual"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ivnugu'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ivnugu/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_415/</li>

It's actually Indira National Congress."<br />Body: "\n\nThe INC party that we know today is not the party of Nehru or Gandhi or Bose. That party doesn't exist any more. It was gone in 1969. Let's go through history to see more - \n\nIn 1969, due to internal party politics, the rise of Jan Sangh and  Samyukta Vidhayak Dal and due to the personality cult of Indira Gandhi , the original INC party was split in two parties. One was officially called INC(O) lead by K Kamaraj &amp; Morarji Desai. The other was lead by Indira Gandhi and was known INC(R). In AICC 1969, 446 member switched to INC(R) and 259 members switched to INC(O). \n\nINC(O) joined Janata Morcha and ruled in several state governments including Bihar and Gujarat. They also had several MPs in 1971 election where Indira Gandhi was at her peak . After 1977 post emergency election , INC(O), Bharatiya Lok Dal, Bharatiya Jan Sangh, SCP, Swatantra Party formed together the Janata Party.\n\nINC(R) came to be known as the New Congress. In 1971 election, INC(R) won 352 seats in lok sabha. Later  INC(R) evolved to INC(I), the 'I' standing for Indira. People living in 80's and 90's would remember Congress(I) in election wall paintings and ballot papers. \n\nSo if somebody tells you INC is Indian National Congress, tell him/her it's actually Indira National Congress created in 70's.\n\nJanata Party later split up in several parties. It's legacy lives on in Bharatiya Jan Sangh and finally BJP and other regional parties which split from Janata Dal like RJD and BJD. \n\nHope this history lesson entertains and informs you. \n\n\nSpread the word ..."<br />Author: 'RajaAlhaz'  id: 'iv5ow3'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iv5ow3/original_post_lessons_of_history_the_inc_party_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is Quantum Computing: Origin, Application, Challenges, Role in AI'<br />Body: "# What is [Quantum Computing](https://www.geeky4tech.com/2020/09/quantum.html)?\n\nQuantum computing is the use of quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are referred to as quantum computers. Quantum computers can process massive and sophisticated datasets more efficiently than classical computers. They use the fundamentals of physics to hurry up the tactic of solving complex computations. Often those computations incorporate a seemingly unlimited number of variables, and thus the potential applications span industries from genomics to finance. Quantum computers are believed to be ready to solve certain computational problems, substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum computing may be a subfield of quantum informatics.\n\n# What are Quantum Computers\n\nA quantum computer harnesses a variety of the almost-mystical phenomena of quantum physics to deliver huge leaps forward in processing power. Quantum machines promise to outstrip even the foremost capable of today’s and tomorrow’s supercomputers. In a classical (or conventional) computer, information is stored as bits; In a quantum computer, it's stored as qubits (quantum bits). The basic principle of quantum computation is that the quantum properties are often wont to represent and structure data, which quantum mechanisms are often devised and built to perform operations with this data. Examination in both hypothetical and pragmatic territories proceeds at a frenzied pace, and numerous public government and military financing organizations uphold quantum figuring exploration to create quantum PCs for both regular citizen and public security purposes, for example, cryptanalysis.\n\n# Potential Applications of Quantum Computing\n\n➨\xa0Cryptography\n\nQuantum cryptography is the study of abusing quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic assignments. The most popular case of quantum cryptography is quantum key dispersion which offers a data hypothetically secure answer for the key trade issue. The upside of quantum cryptography lies in the way that it permits the finishing of different cryptographic assignments that are demonstrated or guessed to be outlandishly utilizing just traditional correspondence. For instance, it is difficult to duplicate information encoded in a quantum state. If one endeavor to peruse the encoded information, the quantum state will be changed. This could be utilized to distinguish listening in quantum key dissemination.\n\n➨\xa0Quantum search\n\nThe Quantum information base pursuit of Grover accomplishes the assignment of finding the objective component in an unsorted data set in a period quadratically quicker than the old-style PC. We survey Grover's quantum scan calculations for a burn and numerous objective components in an information base. But, there is no accessible structure in the assortment of potential answers, The quantity of potential responses to check is equivalent to the number of contributions to the calculation, and There exists a Boolean capacity which assesses each information and decides if it is the right answer.\n\n➨\xa0Quantum Simulation\n\nSimulating quantum mechanics is known to be a troublesome computational issue, particularly when managing huge frameworks. Be that as it may, this trouble might be overwhelmed by utilizing some controllable quantum framework to consider another less controllable or available quantum framework, i.e., quantum reenactment. Quantum recreation vows to have applications in the investigation of numerous issues in, e.g., consolidated issue material science, high-vitality material science, nuclear material science, quantum science, and cosmology. Quantum reproduction could be actualized utilizing quantum PCs, yet additionally with less difficult, simple gadgets that would require less control, and thusly, would be simpler to build. Various quantum frameworks, for example, unbiased iotas, particles, polar atoms, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, atomic twists, and photons have been proposed as quantum tests systems. This audit diagrams the fundamental hypothetical and test parts of quantum reproduction and accentuates a portion of the difficulties and guarantees of this quickly developing field.\n\n# Disadvantages of Quantum Computing &amp; Computers\n\n➨\xa0There is a drawback to the quantum computing industry. The greatest inconvenience is the way that it has not been completely designed at this point, and individuals are as yet making parts and projections about what and how this computer will look like.\n\n➨\xa0Quantum computing is that the quantum processor by D-Wave, which should be kept at .02 Kelvin For the individuals who are not science majors, .02 Kelvin is underneath the temperature of the universe, and near outright Kelvin, which is the most reduced temperature conceivable. This is a hard temperature to keep up and control.\n\n➨\xa0The fundamental issue with quantum computing is to really create it as a PC, and ideally, they will be in the value scope of consistent purchasers. It will be similar to when PCs were first presented. They were the size of a room and were expensive. At that point, they continued getting littler and littler and in the end, showed up available. Doubtlessly, similar kind of change from those PCs to quantum PCs will happen, from the start, they will be available just too huge organizations however then they will go on the business market.\n\nIf you find something Interesting then read the full article [Quantum Computing](https://www.geeky4tech.com/2020/09/quantum.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gd1cy0fxvn51.jpg?width=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00ad82a4d56affd6187bb6f1aef044765a6f31ff"<br />Author: 'Geeky_4_Tech'  id: 'iv3p71'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iv3p71/what_is_quantum_computing_origin_application/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Focused approach to ensuring women's safety and empowering women in India"<br />Body: "I'm the founder of a non-profit called [Shuddhi Fund](https://shuddhifund.org) that is based in Chennai, but aspires to be a global non-profit organisation. I started Shuddhi Fund quite recently (2017) and it aims to transform a [few key areas of society](https://medium.com/shuddhi-fund/our-2030-mandate-92888324e49f).\n\nOne of the areas that is very dear to me is [Women's safety and women empowerment](https://youtu.be/ddJJHn-5ntI?t=145). I'm a man and I've never faced any kind of harassment or abuse myself. But I know the reality that women have to endure. There is a massive lack of safety for women, not just in India, but especially in India. And also there is a certain level of helplessness for those women who're unfortunate enough to be victims of incidents of abuse, assault or harassment.\n\nJust as a human being, I want to see a different reality where women get to explore the world fully, bring out the highest potential in them as well as anyone, without fearing for their safety or fearing harassment of any kind. And I see my non-profit as a platform where I can slowly but surely contribute to this reality.\n\nI have a few ideas that I would like to share here and initiate a discussion so that we can together brainstorm some workable ideas to bring forth a better future:-\n\n1. **Create a strong and unified support structure for women** \\- This I believe is the strongest weapon in our suite. It is really challenging to find people who truly understand and recognise women's struggles, for various reasons, lack of exposure being one of the biggest. The only ones who truly understand women's struggles are other women. There has to be local groups that women can participate in, to discuss issues, come together to do something of collective interest and just have a strong and reliable support structure to fall back on when things are difficult for them as an individual woman. \n2. **Ease of justice** \\- A whole lot of times women are discouraged from seeking justice in instances of sexual assault or exploitation purely because the established structure, the protocol for seeking justice is not sensitive enough to be what women would need in a situation like that. Women and their families go through a really tough time after an incident and need nurturing and support as they seek justice. A whole lot of women are forced to retreat into safety and curtail their exploration of the world and in turn let the abusers and the predators gain confidence in their actions, simply by refraining from putting in the discouraging amount of effort it takes to successfully seek justice. Ease of justice has to be bolstered. Ease of justice is a much larger issue and is not limited to this context and repairing that in this country could take several decades of active and persistent collective effort. But in the meantime, we can use the aforementioned support structure to step in and offer a streamlined process that the victims of abuse can go through to find representation as they seek justice. Only when justice is enforced and made practical to pursue, the predators will have an incentive to stop. So this is more critical than just justice itself. It is also about prevention of future incidents.\n\nThere are other things that need to be focused, but I feel like these two issues above alone, if done properly, can lead to huge progress in this regard. \n\nI have more specific ideas involving technological interventions that can help in progressing in the two points mentioned above, but I thought for an initial round of discussions it would be nice to have the opinions of others who've thought about bringing constructive changes in this arena. \n\nWith this post I'm mainly looking for viewpoints that would contribute towards orchestrating a structured effort to make things better for women in the society. Please share anything that would constructively add to practical solutions and things to consider while tackling an issue as massive as this. Feel free to also share pointers to other individuals/organisations/entities that are working towards the same. I would discourage against cynical posts or rants that don't offer much towards constructive, solution-oriented steps to tackling the reality."<br />Author: 'haloblossom'  id: 'iugojl'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iugojl/focused_approach_to_ensuring_womens_safety_and/</li>

Every time she comments on social media or gives an interview , you can read between the lines that she is trying to enter into politics. She will be the BJP's candidate in Himachal Pradesh in 2024 General Elections\n\n This is BJP's attempt at getting back at the Shiv Sena for ditching them in Maharashtra to join the Aghadi. When Kangana compared Mumbai to POK  the Shiv Sena should have not taken the bait but the Shiv Sena being the goon party that they are vandalized her office making her look like the victim and losing face amongst the public by beating up an army veteran for a cartoon which is deplorable and absolutely unacceptable. This shows that Shiv Sena fell into BJP's trap, The Shiv Sena will get decimated in the Maharashtra Assembly elections\n\nNone of tv news channels or the political establishment care about Sushant Singh Rajput's death, the BJP is using his death to bring down the Aghadi Government. If the Shiv Sena leaves Aghadi and rejoins the NDA this case would disappear from most news tv channels\n\nThe killers of Sushant Singh Rajput would not be in the country. They would have left the country by now. When Sushant Singh Rajput was killed , the Galwan Valley Incident happened the next day where 20 Indian Soldiers died, the killers would have escaped India and gone to a different country and avoided media scrutiny because those 10 days the media was only focused on China.

For this to ACTUALLY happen, we can stop being basic by not hating these feminists but by actively taking part in *redefining* feminism, which really demands just equality for all sexes (called feminine because female sex was the first one to be degraded), it is not against male or non-binary.

However, they did say that if I got Apple to agree, they would fix.\n\nSo I called up Apple. They asked for pictures and I shared. This followed:\n\n- They agreed that this could be fixed under Apple Care. \n- They even said they would register feedback against the service centre in the first place for refusing.\n- They then themselves set up an appointment for me at a different service centre for 2 days later, and said this would be looked into.\n- They even went to the extent of saying I should call them from the service centre if I face any issue.\n\nWhen I arrived at the service centre though:\n\n- The service centre had not been informed of my case, and refused to replace my cable.\n- I called Apple and this time the person straight up refused to help. Said this was damage that would not be covered.\n- When I pointed out that it was them who set up the appointment **after** looking at my photos, they had no answers and just parroted the same replies.\n- I told them I had recorded my previous call and they could check. They refused to accept and even said they would refuse to talk if I was recording the current call.\n- Also gave me some bullshit about my program being Apple Care and not Apple Care+, which covers damage. I told them that Apple Care+ is anyway not sold in India so they're just deviating from my issue and trying to distract.\n\nI kept asking them one thing - 2 days ago they saw the photos, determined they would help, and set up my appointment. Today, they refused. What changed? I wouldn't have shown up at the store if they refused in the first place?\n\nI got no helpful response. And ultimately had to buy the cable replacement because this was a 50 kilometer round trip to the store, and I didn't want to make another even if Apple agrees later.\n\nWhat are my options?

      <li>Title::: 'Council of Sandrokottos | Decline of the Left in the 21st Century'<br />Body: 'Hi,\n\nThis is your weekly newsletter from the Council of Sandrokottos.\xa0\xa0\n\nThis week we are going to discuss about the decline of the Left in the 21st Century and list out the factors which led to the rise of the left in the 20th Century.\n\nThe 20th Century witnessed the growth of the left due to various factors which are -\xa0\n\n1. *Growth of a new industrial labour class* \\- 20th Century witnessed massive rise of production due to new techniques like assembly line manufacturing etc. New jobs were created with growth of new industries like the automobile industry, Electric and power companies and resulting newer mills and factories running on oil and electric power. The mode of travel changed. The mode of communication changed. Stock markets sprang up. And this resulted in newer jobs in secondary and tertiary occupations. The workers in such jobs were skilled and most times educated to a fair degree. This separated them from earlier farming occupations and traders. They realized the need of labour legislation as this new class did not have enough rights back then. This created left movements throughout the course of the 20th Century across different parts of the world - be it the Bolshevik Revolution, rise of socialism in Indian National Congress, rise of socialism in the UK with newer labour legislations and of course rise of\xa0 the far left communism.\n\n2. *Rise of the extremist right* *-* With rise of extremist right wing organizations like the Nazi party and the Fascists, the Ku Klux Klan in the US and continuing imperialism in Asia during the first half of the 20th Century, the left gained a saner objective to counter the challenges posed to the world by the conservative and far right ideologies. The left gained public sentiments as the right wing held itself with the ideas and systems that were oppressive.\n\n3. *Struggle for democratic values* \\- The 20th Century witnessed struggle for democratic values and ideas of liberty. This resulted in many new born young nations in the 20th Century. It brought the world to witness leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. With the right wing mostly engaged in the violent methodologies, the left wing and liberal communities became the torch bearers to carry forward the values taught to the world by these leaders. Hence, the liberal bloc became a key voice to the struggle for democracy. For example, most countries like India gained independence from the shackles of imperialism when the Labour Party was in power in the UK.\xa0\xa0\n\n4. *Growth of liberalism* \\- The 20th Century witnessed two world wars and one long running cold war. All such wars ended in the 20th Century itself and it allowed growth of liberalism in periods following such wars. That is how we witness abundant economic growth in the 1920s, 1950s and 1990s. These three decades witnessed much more global trade and exchange of ideas than decades before them as with higher levels of growth, custom duties and trade barriers were relaxed. Especially the last such decade of liberalism - 1990s - created a phenomenon called globalization.\n\nNow, let us understand the decline of the left in the 21st Century.\n\n1. *Drastic change in media* \\- A majority of the left and liberal leaders came from an educated or skilled class of people as described above. They had most of their thoughts expressed through the means of media and public speech. In fact the very roots of the initial left and other such labour movements can be traced to the media activism. This was predominantly print media. This type of media had editorial supervision and most often carried detailed reports and factual coverage about complex issues that they dealt with. The readers and audience had more attention spans to go through them. In 21st Century, it is the social media which is predominant. It does not have a proper editorial supervision and has vague guidelines giving room to malpractices like the fake news to exist. The viewers of social media have very less attention spans and they are mostly engaged in knowing the broad highlights of a complex issue. Most often such broad highlights are suited to their liking and interests as the social media is able to personalize the information for the viewer. Hence, the new leftists and liberals of the 21st Century have been shaped by the very nature of the current media. Their understanding of issues have been polarized due to the consumption of such personalized news and information. Due to such a polarization, they are not even bothered to check out the facts and pay heed to "Audi Alteram Partem" - a cornerstone of the natural justice. Yes, it is the same natural justice which has been a classical ideology in liberal values.\xa0\n\n2. *Growth of extremist left and identity politics*\xa0\\- With rise of China and decline in practice of the classical values of the left, the left has resorted to the means of violence. As we concluded that the left has become polarized due to personalized consumption of information, the left is seeking out the personal attributes of an individual or such an identity of a community to classify the world into strict binary good and bad. This has been clearly observed in the BLM movement in the US where binary good or bad was based on the identity of race, and the Shaheenbagh movement in India where the binary good or bad was based on the identity of religion. Both these movements were started by the left wing parties and both these movements resulted in violent riots in Kenosha, Portland etc in the US and violent riots in Delhi respectively. And both these movements observed very similar methodologies like the left wing parties blaming the incumbent right wing leader of the nation for all the violence and of course wide of use of the social media as means of provocation to the minority group.\xa0\n\n3. *Struggle for global values in a globalized world* \\- Power balance is shifting to the emerging markets in the East from the much more saturated and developed markets of the West. People like to spend on things that are growing. Where would you invest during 1990s - in an emerging company like Microsoft or the behemoth like IBM? Of course the ones who invested in Microsoft became millionaires. Similarly more and more people throughout the world are investing in the emerging markets of Asia. With these investments along with overseas transfer of jobs, more opportunities are created in countries like India, China and other ASEAN nations. This has created a fear in the West as they lose their investments and jobs. The very nations who gained much prominence in the 20th Century are now finding it hard to sustain same levels of prominence and growth in the 21st Century. Even though global values apparently mean different to the different parts of the world right now, interestingly globalization has given rise to the right wing politics in both parts of the world - emerging as well as developed economies. This clearly started much ahead in the emerging markets like India where people were frustrated out of the long lingering socialist policies of the left oriented government. Indian businesses were gaining due to the shift in balance of power and because of this, a pro-business government was needed. People wanted a government which can act fast to socio-economical and political needs of the rapidly changing multi-polar world. This led to the rise of the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in India in 2014. Similarly, people in the US were frustrated out of the long lingering liberal policies which resulted in their job losses. This led to the rise of protectionism and consequently President Trump in 2016 as nobody better addressed this issue in the US.\xa0\n\n4. *Growth of conservatism and nationalism* \\- The 21st Century has witnessed emphasis on the idea of nationalism by the right wing parties. People who are not likely to become separatists to the idea of nation based on identity are most often supporting this idea with a new enthusiasm. The current globalized world is divided into sovereign nation states and people cling to the ones which offer them a chance not only to live peacefully under an established set of laws but also to pursue their dreams. This is why we are also witnessing a bunch of failed nation states like North Korea, Venezuela, Syria, Pakistan etc. If you happen to be born in any of these nations, the very next thing you would try to do is to emigrate from these nations. A large majority of people in these states do not want to stay in their nation and actively seek to immigrate to a better nation most likely one in the West. Hence, conservatism fuelled by the emotion of nationalism has become need of the hour to keep the wheels of the economy running in a highly connected and competitive world. Even key people on the left understand this to a degree but are unable to devise out effective policies to channelize nationalism into their framework as their framework heavily relies on identity. Hence, conservatism has become a uniting force in a nation and hence more number of nations are witnessing rise of the right wing parties into power. For example, Italy, Australia, India, US, UK, etc\n\nThe Council would be pleased if you could reply with your comments and share your thoughts.\xa0'<br />Author: 'apajku'  id: 'itx55i'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/itx55i/council_of_sandrokottos_decline_of_the_left_in/</li>

Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThere is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\'s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nityānām: God is one. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ. The Supreme God is one-Kṛṣṇa-and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nityānām) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God-Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or pāṣaṇḍī. Even the great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahmā and Śiva (śiva-viriñci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devatāḥ denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (hṛt-añjana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns" in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between the Supreme God-Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa and the demigods ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : How one can find the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlkyyjl0hgn51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52bd76fafdc409ca4c71d3bb03ca9a03ff292402\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'itqhh3'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/itqhh3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is412/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'History of Jihad in India: Post Number 1'<br />Body: 'As promised, here is the first post regarding the series of Jihad in India I intend to write. Jihad first started in India in Sindh.\n\nIn 711, the same year that Tariq ibn Ziyad and his men crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in Count Julian’s boats and began the jihad against Spain, the Umayyad Empire was expanding eastward as well. Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the governor of Iraq, sent the general Muhammad ibn Qasim into Sindh, modern-day western Pakistan. It was the beginning of the jihad conquest of India.\n\nHajjaj gave his commander ruthlessly precise instructions:\n\n"My ruling is given: Kill anyone belonging to the combatants \\[ahl-i harb\\]; arrest their sons and daughters for hostages and imprison them. Whoever submits...grant them aman \\[protection\\] and settle their tribute \\[amwal\\] as dhimmah." \\[1\\]\n\nThis policy severely discouraged resistance. The Muslim invaders of India treated the native population with extraordinary harshness. In jihad campaigns in Europe, as well as in the Middle East and Persia, the warriors of jihad had subjugated the local populations and collected the jizya from them—the Qur’an-mandated (9:29) poll tax to be paid by the People of the Book, that is, the monotheistic Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians.\n\nBut the Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists whom Muhammad ibn Qasim and his jihadis encountered in Hindustan were not People of the Book, and hence no jizya could be demanded from them. Their only choices were to convert to Islam or face the sword of Islam.\n\nThe Indians quickly realized just how ruthless their foe really was. As the Muslims besieged the city of Brahmanabad, its inhabitants saw the writing on the wall:\n\n"If we unite and go forth to fight, we will be killed: for even if peace is \\[subsequently\\] made, those who are combatants \\[ahl-i silat\\] will all be put to death. As for the rest of the people; aman is given to the merchants, artisans, and agriculturalists. It is better that we be trusted. Therefore, we should surrender the fort to him on the basis of a secure covenant \\[ahd-i wathiq\\]." \\[2\\]\n\nHowever, not all of the Sindhis were that willing to give up without a struggle, even at Brahmanabad. The Muslim response was just as fierce; Muslims massacred between six thousand and twenty-six thousand Sindhis at Brahmanabad, six thousand more at Rawar, four thousand at Iskalandah, and six thousand at Multan.\n\nAs Muhammad ibn Qasim’s jihad in India continued, however, it proved to be impractical to offer all the people in India the choice of conversion to Islam or death: there were simply too many people in India for them all to be converted to Islam or killed. Consequently, an adjustment had to be made, and Muhammad ibn Qasim ultimately granted the Hindus the status of the People of the Book, accepting their submission and payment of the jizya, with the ultimate objective remaining to bring all of these people into the fold of Islam. \\[3\\]\n\nThe jihadis, however, were unremittingly ruthless toward Hindu temples. The Qur’an says:\n\n“And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned.” (22:40)\n\nThe Qur’an regards Jesus and the prophets of Hebrew Scriptures as prophets and the Torah and Gospel as legitimate revelations, although it contends that the Jews and Christians twisted their prophets’ words and altered the scriptures they received. Consequently, while many churches and synagogues were seized throughout the history of jihad and turned into mosques, this was never a thoroughgoing or universal policy.\n\nHindu temples, by contrast, were always considered to be centers of idolatry, in which the “name of Allah” was not “much mentioned,” and consequently they were to be destroyed whenever possible.\n\nAt Daybul, the Muslims faced a force of four thousand Rajputs (Indian warriors) and two to three thousand Brahmins (Hindu priests) defending a Hindu temple. Once victorious, Muhammad ibn Qasim had the temple destroyed and the Brahmins circumcised so as to convert them to Islam. However, seeing that his new converts were resisting, rather than embracing, their new religion, he ordered all of them over the age of seventeen to be executed. \\[4\\]\n\nThe victorious jihadis began a massacre so intensive that it lasted three days. 23 Young women and children were enslaved, but in a rare act of mercy, older women were freed outright. 24 Seeing the immensity of the task before him, Muhammad ibn Qasim began encouraging the locals to surrender rather than fight; but this aroused the ire of his boss. Hajjaj wrote to Muhammad urging him to be more discriminating between those who had surrendered sincerely and those who had not, and charged that his practice of granting protection was un-Islamic:\n\n"I am appalled by your bad judgment and astounded by your policies. Why are you so intent on giving aman, even to an enemy whom you have tested and found hostile and intransigent? It is not necessary to give aman to everyone without discrimination.... In any case, if \\[the Sindis\\] sincerely request aman and desist from treachery, they will surely stop fighting. Then income will meet expenditures and this long situation will be concluded.... It is acknowledged that all your procedures have been in accordance with religious law \\[bar jadah-yi shar\\] except for the one practice of giving aman. For you are giving aman to everyone without distinguishing between friend and foe." \\[5\\]\n\nHis instructions to Muhammad ibn Qasim were ruthlessly precise:\n\n"God says, “Give no quarter to infidels but cut their throats.” Then you shall know that this is the command of the great God. You shall not be too ready to grant protection, because it will prolong your work. After this give no quarter to any enemy except those of rank." \\[6\\]\n\nMuhammad ibn Qasim may have been too lenient for Hajjaj’s taste, but as he subdued Sindh he was ruthless against manifestations of non-Muslim religion. At Nirun, he had a mosque built on the site of a Buddhist temple, and appointed an imam to instruct converts in the new, dominant religion.\n\nAfter a series of victories over Dahir, king of Sindh, Muhammad wrote triumphantly to Hajjaj:\n\n"The forts of Siwistan and Sisam have been already taken. The nephew of Dahir, his warriors, and principal officers have been dispatched, and infidels converted to Islam or destroyed. Instead of idol temples, mosques and other places of worship have been built, pulpits have been erected, the Khutba \\[Islamic Friday sermon\\] is read, the call to prayers is raised so that devotions are performed at the stated hours. The takbir \\[“Allahu akbar”\\] and praise to the Almighty God are offered every morning and evening." \\[7\\]\n\nAt Multan, Muhammad ibn Qasim ordered the destruction of an immense idol made of gold, with eyes of rubies. According to the Chach Nama, a twelfth-century Persian history of the conquest of Sindh that may have been based on an earlier Arabic original, “Two hundred and thirty mans of gold were obtained, and forty jars filled with gold dust. This gold and the image were brought to the treasury together with the gems and pearls and treasures which were obtained from the plunder of Multan.” \\[8\\]\n\nMuhammad ibn Qasim left another idol in place at Multan because of its popularity, intending to profit from the many offerings left there; however, to show his horror at Hindu superstition, and seeing that the cow was sacred to Hindus, he ordered that the idol’s necklace be removed and replaced with a piece of cow’s flesh. \\[9\\] The idol did not protest. The great general and his followers told the Hindus that was a sign that their idols were false and the harsh god of the invaders was the only true god.\n\nThe conquering jihad commander sent some of his massive haul back to the caliph Walid, along with two choice sex slaves, the daughters of the Sindhi king Dahir himself. One of them, named Janaki, particularly caught the caliph’s eye, but when he took her to bed, the panicked girl told him that she had already been raped by Muhammad ibn Qasim.\n\nWalid was enraged. Muhammad ibn Qasim had dared to send him damaged goods. Immediately he ordered that the victorious general, victories or no, be sewn up into a rawhide sack and shipped to his court. By the time the sack containing Muhammad ibn Qasim arrived, he was already dead.\n\nThe cause of Walid’s monumental fit of temper, Janaki, was appalled. “The king has committed a very grievous mistake,” she exclaimed, “for he ought not, on account of two slave girls, to have destroyed a person who had taken captive a hundred thousand modest women like us and who instead of temples had erected mosques, pulpits and minarets.” \\[10\\]\n\nIn any case, the killing of Muhammad ibn Qasim stalled the jihad in India. But the subcontinent was never forgotten. A century or so after Muhammad ibn Qasim’s jihad in Sindh, words were put into the mouth of Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, emphasizing the importance of jihad in India. Abu Huraira, one of Muhammad’s companions, is depicted in a hadith as saying: “The Messenger of Allah promised that we would invade India.” \\[11\\]\n\nIn another hadith, Muhammad himself says: “There are two groups of my Ummah whom Allah will free from the Fire: The group that invades India, and the group that will be with Isa bin Maryam \\[Jesus Christ\\], peace be upon him.” \\[12\\]'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'it6aye'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/it6aye/history_of_jihad_in_india_post_number_1/</li>

The matters that i think he handled very well are:\n1. Criminalising Triple Talaq in India.\n2. GST (It's way easier to pay taxes in India now)\n3. Parivahan Seva (Initially every state has to have their own rules and tracking of theft vehicles or cases used to be an issue)\n4.

      <li>Title::: 'The pitiful state of leftists.'<br />Body: 'Ever since Chetan Bhagat wrote a supposedly "brilliant" article on the economy, my left-liberal friends have gone into overdrive mode, messaging me about this wonderful article and its amazing points. Since leftists consider absolutely anything written against Modi wonderful, so it doesn\'t really count for much. Let\'s dissect this article in an impassioned way instead of, "Mudi Fascist! Dissent!!!"\n\nIf you write an article criticizing the Narendra Modi government, it is natural and obvious that people like Shashi Tharoor will like the article, tweet about it and write some nice words about it. It was therefore amusing that someone like Chetan Bhagat was [over the moon](https://twitter.com/chetan_bhagat/status/1305090962247483392) that “*the great Shashi Tharoor*” liked his article!\n\nIt has been a long time since I read any article of Chetan Bhagat, so I thought maybe this is overdue and proceeded to read his article that was pompously and arrogantly [titled](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/The-underage-optimist/the-youth-need-to-shut-their-phones-and-ask-about-the-economy/) “***The youth need to shut their phones and ask about the economy***”.\n\nIt’s actually difficult to take any article seriously that starts with saying that demonetization has “***derailed India’s economic growth momentum for years***.” For a man of Chetan Bhagat’s repute, one would expect that some statistics are presented to explain this (or any) case, but he doesn’t. The entire article follows this path – make patronizing and hefty statements without the backing of a single statistic. It is therefore no wonder that the likes of Shashi Tharoor loved this article.\n\nFor example, by the end of 2017, One year after demonetization, India’s quarterly GDP growth rate was at 8.2%, nearly close to what it was the quarter before demonetization. How then would intellectuals like Chetan Bhagat and Rahul Gandhi continue to blame demonetization for reduction in growth in late 2018?\n\nIt’s further difficult to take any article seriously if it proudly mentions the economic stimulus package of the USA but doesn’t even squeak about the massive [21 lakh crore package](https://www.thehindu.com/news/resources/economic-stimulus-package-details-of-20-lakh-crore-package-announced-by-union-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-in-five-tranches/article31606806.ece) announced by the Prime Minister of India. Because it is in this same article that the author derides Indians by telling us that “***We, the Indians, are desperate to feel validated that we are good enough***.” I don’t know about the “***desperation***” of fellow Indians, but it sure looks like the author is desperate enough to feel so good about what the USA did and ignore what our country has done.\n\nChetan Bhagat sermonizes that “***The first step is to acknowledge the problem***.” Oh, where would we have been without such a massive piece of advice? A package of **INR 21-lakh crore** to revive the economy was announced without acknowledging the problem? Nearly **INR 70,000 crore** was given to [42 crore citizens](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1652231) of our country as part of the “***Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package***” – this was planned and distributed without acknowledging that there was a problem? I can cite more statistics that shows the acknowledgement of the problem but there are more points from the original article that I wish to discuss further!\n\nThe latest fad on social media is to deride the lockdown. Chetan Bhagat merely follows this trend, yet again without the backing of a single statistic. While citizens have understood the need for a lockdown early, intellectuals still don’t seem to get a handle around why an early lockdown actually helped India. Citing today’s high number of cases, without a proper context, is the specialty of these intellectuals. If we didn’t have a lockdown, our doubling rate would have been worse. Doomsday predictions in March indicated that we will have 3 crore cases by July. I am willing to bet that this same Chetan Bhagat and Shashi Tharoor would have been on the forefront writing articles about how Modi was not brave enough to impose a lockdown in our country to prevent the COVID impact!\n\nI continued to read the article to see if it gets any serious. And then I read this suggestion – “***Open the economy up. Like really***.” What does this even mean? Why couldn’t he give one, just one concrete example of what he thinks the government should do to “open the economy up”? Who writes like this? Like really!\n\nAnd then it comes to the killer paragraph – “**At an immediate level, the government needs to give a real fiscal stimulus. As a poor nation, we can’t have a big stimulus. But whatever it is, it has to be a real one, not just numbers that grab headlines**.”\n\n“***Real fiscal stimulus***”, “***has to be a real one***” – I am now trying to understand Chetan Bhagat’s obsession with the word “***real***”! What does he mean by all these sentences? He couldn’t find time to give a single useful concrete suggestion on what a “***real one***” should look like? Does he want money into the pockets of the poor? Because that is being done already. Does he want loans to be given at low or no interests for small vendors to setup/revive business? Because that is being done already. You can read the article 100 times, but you will not get a clue on what the “***real one***” is!\n\nSo, what exactly does he want? He wants this – “***The youth needs to shut that phone and rise*****.**” Is your head spinning? It will spin further when you read the “real one” – “***They need to keep asking questions — why isn’t there more growth?***”\n\nChetan Bhagat tells us that the youth doesn’t care and are stuck doing silly things on their phone and for our economy to rise, the youth have to focus on their dreams and make money and shut down their phone! After reading the article, I am stupefied as to who he is criticizing – the government of India or the youth of India?\n\nNo one is saying that a -23% drastic fall is something to ignore. But one needs to be really myopic not to see the acknowledgement of the problem all around – by the youth and by the government. Follow the right people to know the real demands of the various industries that are still suffering and how the package can be enhanced. Read the right publications to understand the nature of demands being made and how they are being fulfilled. And then perhaps you will see how your article falls short of logic and reason.\n\nChetan Bhagat may deride the belief of Hindus in his article (yep, he managed to write about Hindus, youth, economy and phones in the same article!), but you aren’t seeing straight if you cannot see the plain simple fact that Corona virus is not the act of this government and a tough decision had to be taken to arrest the spread of a dangerous virus, at the cost of temporary hit to the economy.\n\nI have one final observation. If the youth shut their phones down, many youths associated with the phone and telecommunications industry will lose their jobs. Does Chetan Bhagat want to revive economy by losing jobs? Dear Chetan Bhagat, if you find this logic laughable, then that’s exactly how I found your article to be!'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'it1krq'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/it1krq/the_pitiful_state_of_leftists/</li>

When Chanda Devi first raised a complaint, the judge got her arrested in a false case and the lady had claimed that the SP was in cahoots with the judge. It was only when she shared phone audio recordings of Ansari’s obscene calls to her with authorities &amp; they were leaked and went viral, did the Jharkhand High Court finally suspend Naeem Ansari.\nAdvocate Ashish Dubey and the Agniveer team had played a prominent role in providing legal assistance to Chanda Devi – at a time when her matter was getting buried in the system, they had escalated it by writing to NHRC, PMO etc. They had also highlighted the SP’s dubious role in the whole matter.\nThat SP, who Chanda Devi had alleged was involved in lodging a false case against her, is Mohammed Arshi (IPS). Ever since Agniveer had played a part in exposing his alleged role in the Chanda Devi matter, the officer nursed a grudge agains them.\nOn 30 April, Ashish was passing by a road in Palamu (a district neighbouring Garhwa) which was in a very bad condition. So he got down to take some photos to highlight the state of disrepair. He noticed police vehicles too were stuck in the traffic, and clicked a few photos of the same. Apparently, SP Arshi was seated in one of the vehicles and immediately ordered his staff to snatch Ashish’s mobile and take him into custody – there was no warrant, neither was Ashish told why he was being detained.\nIn illegal custody, Ashish was brutally thrashed and pressurised to sign a fake statement that he is involved in engineering communal tension and riots in the state.\nIt was only when fellow lawyers &amp; the Agniveer team mounted a strong protest, that Ashish was released by police and taken for treatment.\n\n\nhttps://www.hindupost.in/news/agniveer-bjp-activist-brutally-assaulted-jharkhand-police-garhwa-sp-mohd-arshi-role-alleged/'<br />Author: 'Sea_Shrimps'  id: 'it0p0b'<br />Score:200<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/it0p0b/til_ips_mohd_arshi_student_of_zakat_foundation/</li>

Exactly. Now, let me answer that absurd claim.\n\nWe’ve heard this smear over and over again. The claim that the Delhi riots of Feb 2020 were a ‘pogrom.’ At first, they would not even accept that people of both communities had suffered loss of life. Eventually, they had to concede that much. The argument promptly evolved to something like this:\n\nMore victims belonged to community X and therefore, the Delhi riots had to be a pogrom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept we can debunk this theory with basic data analysis. More at the level of common sense.\n\nLet us step back from rhetoric, reduce passions and focus on facts. In the terrible tragedy of the Delhi riots, there was a loss of 51 lives. Of these, 36 persons belonged to Community X and 15 persons belonged to Community Y. The liberal argument goes thus: We know that 36 is greater than 15 and this proves that the riot was a pogrom against Community X.\n\nLet us see what happens to this argument when we apply common sense. Suppose there are 1000 people who pick up a street fight with another group of 1000 people. Which side would you expect to have higher casualties?\n\nNeither, you would say. Since the number of people on the two sides is equal, you would expect both sides to inflict roughly equal damage on each other.\n\nNow let us change the equation somewhat. What if a crowd of 2000 people got into a fight with a crowd of 1000 people? Which side would have more casualties?\n\nIt’s easy to see. The side that is numerically weaker would suffer a higher number of casualties. How much more? If it is 2000 vs 1000, the numerically weaker side would suffer roughly twice as many casualties as the other.\n\nNow let us look at the population of Delhi. Roughly speaking, 82% of people belong to Community X and 13% of people belong to Community Y (remaining 5% belong to other groups). If a fight broke out between the two groups, you would expect therefore that the casualties among X would be four times the number of casualties among Y.\n\nA little over\xa0**6:1**\xa0: That is the ratio you would expect.\n\nAgain, this is a very simple minded estimate, but fair enough. It works because the number of casualties is very small compared to the total population of either community.\n\nSo 6:1 is the ratio you would expect to see. Now what was the observed ratio in the Delhi riots?\n\nIt was 36 from X community and 15 from Y community, a ratio of\xa0**2.4:1**, which is substantially less than 6:1.\n\nSo how could it have been a pogrom against X? Sure, X suffered more casualties, but you have to adjust for the fact that community X was numerically weaker by a factor of 4! In any street fight, X would suffer more casualties than Y. That does not prove it was a pogrom.\n\nWait! We haven’t even spoken about the police yet. The liberal accusation is that this was a ‘pogrom,’ with the police actively supporting community Y.\n\nBut we have already established that in any street face off, with police not favoring any side, the ratio in casualties would be 6:1.\n\nNow if you say that the police was actively helping community Y carry out a pogrom, what would happen to this 6:1 ratio? Would it go higher or lower?\n\nHigher, obviously. Community Y already has the numerical advantage. If the police were to join in on their side, they would inflict even more casualties on X. The ratio would go up, maybe to 7:1 or more.\n\nBut it didn’t. In fact, it was much less than 6:1. It was 2.4:1!\n\nDid members of community Y pre-plan the riots? Again, if Y had the advantage of pre-planning along with its numerical advantage, the ratio would be higher than 6:1, not lower!\n\nSo you have to reject both of these claims from liberals. No, the police definitely did not side with community Y. Nor did members of community Y have the thing pre-planned.\n\n*Delhi riots were terrible and tragic. But they were NOT a pogrom. Period*.\n\nNow let us ask how the ratio could have declined from the expected 6:1 to the observed 2.4:1. There are basically two possibilities.\n\n(1) The Delhi Police worked very hard to shield minority communities from violence. This blunted the numerical advantage of the majority during the riots.\n\n(2) Some leaders of the minority community had pre-planned the violence. So when the riots broke out, the majority community was taken by surprise and hence they suffered more casualties than expected.\n\nBoth of these explanations would reduce the ‘pogrom’ theory to dust. If you can come up with another explanation for the numbers being what they are, I am eager to listen.\n\nFinally, let us ask : who had the motive? Who would gain from Delhi going up in smoke exactly as the President of the United States is visiting?\n\nSecular leaders had motive. The casualty figures from the Delhi riots suggest that secular leaders had the advantage of pre-planning when the violence began. We even have videos of riot ammunition being dumped from the homes of secular leaders. Delhi riots are an open and shut case. This is not a pogrom.\n\nIndia has actually seen a pogrom. Back in 1984, when over 3,000 members of one community were killed but not a single member from any other community. That was not a riot, not two groups of people fighting. That was state-sponsored [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots).'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'isle30'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/isle30/a_response_to_an_absolutely_senile_stupid_and/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Umar Khalid deserves whatever is coming to him.'<br />Body: 'Umar Khalid has been arrested by the Delhi Police as a conspirator to the anti-Hindu riots which broke out in Northeast Delhi early this year, the bulk of which were orchestrated by former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, JNU freeloader Umar Khalid, Khalid Saifi and others. As per various reports, and according to Tahir Hussain’s admission himself, Umar Khalid was the brains behind the timing of the riots, and was responsible for making them coincide with US President Donald Trump’s first state visit to India, apart from also inciting mobs distantly. Now that the seditious freeloader, who availed an infructuous education at JNU at the expense of Indian taxpayers has been arrested, it is only befitting to remember how a monster, though an intellectual one, was created out of the unemployable India-hater.\n\nIt all started when in the winter of 2016, Umar Khalid and his gang of JNU freeloaders were perhaps for the very first time challenged and stopped from conducting seditious demonstrations freely. Umar and his gang, comprising of Kanhaiya Kumar, Shehla Rashid and Anirban Bhattacharya, among other termites, were exposed back then for organising a remembrance of what according to them, was the so-called “unjust” execution of Afzal Guru, a terrorist who was involved in the terror attack on the Indian parliament in 2001.\n\nThe JNU fiasco of early 2016 was a grand one, where Indians, for the first time, saw a section of the university’s students for what they were: anti-India bigots high on illegal intoxicants, dreaming about the destruction of this country from all its corners. Of course, liberals and leftists from across the country rose in wholehearted support of the new revolutionaries from JNU, who would finally achieve the liberal dream of bringing India under the rule of an Islamic politburo, governed by Sharia no less.\n\nLiberals and opposition parties did not shy away from standing in support of Umar Khalid, even as the country’s citizens, who are not shameless freeloaders-off taxpayer money cum anti-nationals, decided to rise against the growing forces seeking the ruin of India. Nevertheless, Umar became a liberal star. Literature fests, friendly Indian media conversations and a demented appreciation for him from braindead zombies became almost a daily schedule.\n\nProjecting himself as an anti-BJP and anti-Hindutva crusader, Umar Khalid reached the pinnacle of his temporary intellectual limelight, gifted to him in abundance by the country’s foolish liberals. On all issues, Umar stood at loggerheads with the government – which is fine. For speaking against the government, nobody touched Umar. Even as he went about the country spewing poison, Indians and law enforcement agencies ignored the man.\n\nUmar Khalid projected himself as a far-left atheist, despising the very concept of God and religion. Yet, the man found fault with Hindus alone. Still, we ignored the man. When the mask fell off from his face, and he took to [preach about the noble virtues](https://twitter.com/UmarKhalidJNU/status/1185816080163328000?s=20) of Muhammad while deriding Hindutva, this country’s citizens ridiculed him for his hypocrisy and duplicity, and nothing more. As he, a perfect example of what a far-left atheist stands for, took to sing laurels about Muhammad and Islam, Indians laughed it off, recognising what a two-faced lunatic they were unfortunately dealing with.\n\nBut then came the anti-Hindu riots, masterminded by Umar Khalid. This was it. Freedoms have their limit, and orchestrating violence against Hindus, only to teach the ruling government a lesson was a step taken by Khalid and his gang which has ultimately landed their worthless selves in jail. On Sunday, he was interrogated for hours, till about 1 PM, and then eventually arrested in the evening, subsequently being slapped with stringent charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The Delhi Police have asked for 10 days custody of the man, in order to confront him with data which runs into a massive 11 lakh pages!\n\nThis was it. Umar Khalid’s blissful "revolution" is now over, and he will now have to face the consequences for orchestrating violence against Hindus, and doing so during no less than when the US’ President was visiting India. Tahir Hussain revealed that Umar Khalid advised him to stock up on large quantities of acid, to target Hindus with during the violence which was to be unleashed from 24th February in the national capital. Four days prior, in Amravati, Umar Khalid took to inciting Islamists to rise up against the Modi government during the US President’s visit. Khalid reinvigorated the laughable theory of ‘targeted mob lynching’ against Muslims and then went on to propound how when Muslims did not rebel against the Ram Janmbhoomi judgement by Supreme Court, the government took it for granted that they can bring any law against Muslims.\n\nInciting the crowd further, saying the CAA has been brought to harm Muslims, Khalid said that the people should show the government its *aukaat*, and take to the streets to throw it out. He further says that if enough people take to the streets, first the “anti-Muslim” CAA will go, then the non-existent NPR and NRC, and eventually the government will also go.\n\nThe Modi government has now decided to pull the plug off Umar Khalid’s luxurious freedoms, which he was abusing to further seditious nonsense about India turning anti-Muslim. While Opposition and Left parties took to support Umar, those running the show currently seemed unmoved by liberal theatrics which claim that a student is being punished for voicing his rightful opinion.\n\nUmar Khalid is one of the many temporary blue-eyed intellectuals created by Indian media. While a section of media, which has sold its soul and its honor over the past 70 years to one political entity in the country took to creating a hero out of Umar, availing him and his undeserving friends limelight of the magnitude which no anti-India lowlife deserves.\n\nUmar Khalid’s father has been associated with the terror organisation SIMI, and as it turns out, the son is far more of an extremist, ideologically, than his father perhaps ever was. Yet, due to the media’s immense contributions, the man was successfully passed off as an ‘intellectual’ by India’s liberals. Having been given a lot of free pass by those on the left, Khalid perhaps presumed that he was now a law unto himself for the country’s law enforcers, and that he could do as he pleased. Unfortunately for him, the bigoted and Islamist facade of his now stands shattered, with the Indian state treating the man for what he is – a scumbag and a terrorist.'<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'iskou3'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iskou3/umar_khalid_deserves_whatever_is_coming_to_him/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Saba Naqvi, Kuwaiti government and the recent propaganda in Middle-East about "Islamic genocide in India". Bonus, this By CyberHunts.'<br />Body: '&gt;This was a long due thread that I wanted to post but after Umar Khalid arrest I decided to post this thread. Hope this gonna reach the maximum people and I gonna get maximum support from you people\'s. \n\n&gt;Let\'s start here: While working with different news channels, Saba Naqvi started working with one of the biggest NGOs, Quill foundations. What does Quill Foundations do? Founded in 2015, Quill Foundation portends to be an autonomous institution engaging in research and advocacy in India.\n\n\n&gt; In 2018, she became involved with DOTO Database (Documentation of the Oppressed), an online portal with data on religious identity based hate-crime against minorities that has happened in India since 2014. The website was launched on 7 March 2018 at Constitution Club of India, New Delhi. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ram Punyani, Teesta Setalvad, Zafar ul Islam Khan, John Dayal, Ravi Nair. Saba Naqvi and other social activists.\n\n&gt;"Documentation of the Oppressed" is run by a network of civil society organizations, both at the national and at the grass-root level like Quill Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, CHRI, People\'s Union for Civil Liberties and others.\n\n&gt;Quill\'s official statement is that Quill\'s core work revolves around pertinent issues of human rights, justice, and equity, faced by the underprivileged sections of the people of India, especially Adivasis, Dalits, Muslims, women, sexual minorities and differently-abled persons. Presently the Delhi based Law and Human Rights Cell (LHRC) under Quill, seeks to examine the many ways in which legal and judicial processes form the context of everyday injustices. And how the interface between law and the social world, constitutes citizens differently in terms of access to rights and justice. The underlying philosophy is the preamble and the fundamental rights of the constitution of India. Our slogan is "Back to the Constitution".\n\n&gt;Here comes the main point. they have started an organization that reports Arab countries about how India became an islamophobic country and how daily Hindus and RSS attacking Muslims in India. we earlier exposed how they demeaning the police force of India. but my previous account suspended I couldn\'t share the link here again of that tweets. she is the founder of the website called http://dotodatabase.com the reason behind starting this website is quite obvious when Modi became prime minister first time in India they found the way to send exaggerated reports on attacks on Muslims to Arab countries (while conveniently ignoring the multiplier attacks by Islamists committing communal violence via murders, rapes, mob lynching on Hindus, especially Dalits) the easiest way as anyone can access this website from around the world. \n\n&gt;I earlier exposed AWQAF (Kuwait Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs) that they are sending around 500 Million Kuwaiti Dinars every year to India. Awqaf Ministry never mentioned in their official accounts or balance sheet for what purpose they are sending it. see below the methodology of DotoDatabase.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cyber_Hunnt/status/1305263473991983104/photo/1\n\n&gt;M. JALSHRIKA is an unknown lawyer from Kuwait who is also involved in conversion in India in the large base is providing support to dotodatabase.\n\n&gt;DOTO Database Network &amp; Partners: Quill Foundation, Citizens Against Hate, Human Rights Defender Alerts(HRDA)-India, United Christian Forum, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative(CHRI), SIO India, United Against Hate, Jamiat Ulema e Hind, All India Muslim Majlis e Mushawrat.\n\n&gt;These were the organizations were involved in Delhi Riots and JNU and AMU students protesting in Delhi against CAA and NRC, where govt. clearly said they did not impose NRC in any state of India. While DoTO received funds from Awqaf Ministry from various ME Countries.\n\n&gt;Posting a few Images of the DoTo Database you people can see what propaganda this Terrorist supporter is running in India against Hindus. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cyber_Hunnt/status/1305263479331274753/photo/1\n\n&gt;I will have submitted financial documents to HMO directly which has clearly mentioned in December Quill received 20 Cr. and distributed to different NGOs and people using money laundering channels and supported in providing Kudarati Biryani for Shaheen Bagh Protest. I would request PMOIndia, HMOIndia  to check the documents immediately and cancel their license. I can\'t put here the whole balance sheet which we got along with bank statements. but I have submitted it to the concerned person who is ordering police to arrest everyone involved in Delhi RIots and Shaheen Bagh.'<br />Author: 'Sea_Shrimps'  id: 'iskjdx'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iskjdx/saba_naqvi_kuwaiti_government_and_the_recent/</li>

Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bhāva, or transcendental love of Godhead.\n\n.\n\nAccording to Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:\n\n.\n\nādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo \'tha bhajana-kriyā\n\ntato \'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ\n\nathāsaktis tato bhāvas tataḥ premābhyudañcati\n\nsādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ.\n\n.\n\n"In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is matured in bhāva, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called premā, the highest perfectional stage of life." In the premā stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one\'s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why it is very difficult for the materially absorbed people to understand the personal form of the Lord ? What are the three stages of attachment to the material world ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What path is outlined in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu to attain the premā stage - constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord ?**\n\n.\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/yygel14ow1n51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5b82ca5b9e9adaa8d9d3714296970e860e2641a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'isf02l'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/isf02l/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_410/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Tablighi Jamaat: Whitewashing of South Asia's largest COVID-19 vector"<br />Body: 'I\'m sure by now we all have read several news articles that seem to vindicate the Tablighi Jamaat from earlier accusations of having willingly spread COVID-19 in India. The verdict reportedly comes Aurangabad bench of Mumbai HC &amp; is now being repeatedly &amp; widely quoted by the far-left to further whitewash Tablighi Jamaat\'s image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to spend some time bringing up relevant points &amp; starting a healthy debate on the same to better understand the verdict &amp; perhaps shed some more light on the entire fiasco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst &amp; foremost, we as Indians know that there are several pockets of the judiciary that are known to be pro-Congress &amp; hence such uncharacteristically strong wording on a judicial verdict is hardly surprising and can be inferred to have been clearly meant for a certain audience. In fact, one can even assume that the verdict was meant more as a headline-worthy \'media fodder\' than any real rebuttal coming from a position of jurisprudence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, I don\'t think a lot of people understand how exponential growth works when it pertains to highly infectious diseases. One can draw analogies with how a single neutron leads to a massive chain reaction in nuclear fission reactions to possibly understand how even 300 "active spreaders" (people not following quarantine directives, hiding symptoms, moving freely &amp; interacting with a large number of people) can now be attributed to having been the source of a large chunk of current active cases. However, what remains incontrovertible in the fact that at one point in time, TJ was directly attributed to more than 1/3rd of COVID cases in ENTIRE SOUTH ASIA. It was arguably much higher in India. Authorities of several different countries have expressed their disapproval of how TJ has operated in light of the COVID outbreak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I know that just like the negative GDP figure, all commie-jihadis are gonna keep beating on this dead horse of a "verdict" until everybody forgets what ACTUALLY happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevermind what you hear on the news, most people now actually have been given to understand that despite strict quarantine instructions, TJ sent its preachers to all corners of India &amp; literally asked them to gather people at mosques for prayers. Search "belgaum mosque covid" on YT and you can actually hear the guys admitting that they came straight from markaaz. They aren\'t locals &amp; they don\'t speak a word of Kannada. This has been one of the most self-evident &amp; shocking revelations for me. It\'s pretty much common knowledge in these parts now &amp; no amount of intellectual "whitewashing" is going to change that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m guessing BJP is going to let this one slide because it doesn\'t want to give even more reasons for stupid shitheads to screech "iSlaMOpHoBiA!!!!". Moreover, it\'s evident from their policies, that no matter what other parties say, they actually care about muslims in India and are unwilling to stir up a hornet\'s nest when they clearly aren\'t interested in vote bank politics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther points to ponder/read up on:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- A person in ahmedabad(?) who made a presentation mathematically explaining how TJ is a major vector for COVID spread in India &amp; was arrested.\n\n\\- TJ\'s Wikipedia page which extensively documents their involvement in terrorist activities across the globe &amp; also has info on COVID related events. Imagine an organization so wrought in controversy that even Wikipedia can\'t scrub it clean from their pages.\n\n\\- The fact that foreign TJs were on illegal visas.

      <li>Title::: 'The never ending Reservation'<br />Body: 'Reservation is bad.\n\nOk now what is the right way to make life less unfair of those who were discriminated and some are still being highly discriminated in society. And make a society where people feel more equal.\n\nThere are two types of Equality - 1. Equality of Opportunity   2. Equality of Outcome\n\nReservations are 2nd type of Equality - Equality of Outcome, what we need in our society is Equality of Opportunity. But equality of opportunity requires efforts and a good intention.\n\nFor understanding let me give you a analogy-\n\nIf we give some people Aata, Water and Ghee. We will get different results like Roti, Bati, Parantha, and bread. Some will just add sugar and can make Halwa and Laddu, some will make some other things.\n\nGiving everyone Aata, Water and Ghee is Equality of Opportunity.\n\nAnd if we say there are less production of Bati and Bread, and there are large production of Roti and Parantha .So we control the result and say that this much Roti and Paranthas should be produced.\n\nThis is Equality of Outcome.\n\n(Now wait before bashing me in replies and read the whole thing)\n\nNow come to the caste system. Caste system is not a process which is we evolve into as a society. It\'s not like everyone is making what they like to eat and that\'s why the production of Bati and Bread is less and Roti and Parantha is high, But some people are forced to choose and allowed only to eat Bati and Bread. And if they try to eat Parantha they were killed and beaten up.\n\nWhat reservation does is gives marginalised community a fixed number of seats which is the lower limit and seats can be higher than that and no one can steal those seats from them. That\'s it.\n\nWhat reservation don\'t do is - End discrimination and attrocities, Intercaste marriage, Financial empowerment of whole community, and other caste related issues. Then what is the thing which do all these things which Reservation can\'t do? Those things are - SC/ST attrocities (prevention) Act, Social campaigns and Awareness, Welfare Schemes.\n\nBut we have all these things and still there are discrimination in society, then what\'s missing? - What is the thing that is missing is "Equality of Opportunity". We have all these things but there\'s no intention to remove caste based discrimination. What we have is polarisation and appeasement, there\'s equality only on paper.\n\nWhat we have -\n\nReservation, Free schools, Very less or non at all fees in forms, colleges and hostels, loan schemes for business, Prevention of Attrocities Act\n\nWhat we don\'t have -\n\nBetter facilities ( some don\'t have basic facilities) in those Schools and Colleges, No environment for even thinking of doing somethings else what currently doing, worst law and order system and many many other very important things which is required to have a Equality of Opportunity.\n\n(Most of the marginalised community people loose at School level itself, only "financially sound and very few dedicated" people from these community enjoy the benefits of reservation. And for most of them there is atleast one more generation which is at same place)\n\nSo, in the end I only wanted to say is that if there\'s no or enough Equality of Opportunity no matter how much years and with any percentage of reservation , discrimination will not end.\n\nSo if you want to end this "unfair and anti-merit" reservation, first demand Equality of Opportunity, without these nothing will change. Don\'t vote for who will give your community how much reservation or who will end reservation, vote who will create environment for Equality of Opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit - Also read this I find these interesting -  [In countries with higher gender equality, women are less likely to get STEM degrees](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/does-gender-equality-result-in-fewer-female-stem-grads)\n\n[The More Gender Equality, the Fewer Women in STEM](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/the-more-gender-equality-the-fewer-women-in-stem/553592/)\n\nAnd in India -  [India tops the world in India tops the world in producing female graduates in STEM but ranks 19th in employing them](https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/news/india-tops-the-world-in-producing-female-graduates-in-stem-but-ranks-19th-in-employing-them/articleshow/74117413.cms?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Click_through_social_share)\n\nWomen in India are at the bottom in hierarchy in every caste/religion/tribe. And things are not simple as that we think and will take push from every sides including the marginalised to make things more equal.'<br />Author: 'newaccountforgmail'  id: 'irwm69'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/irwm69/the_never_ending_reservation/</li>

Don't you wanna support local content by putting all your attention there? There may be a few reasons for this:\n\n\\#1 - Pakistan is a Muslim country (with a hard M), naturally there are crippling laws that stifle free expression. And that makes the content by Pak users to be bland and politically too correct to be found entertaining. That makes them curious about their neighbors who seem to have a freer and more colorful life. \n\n\\#2 - I think the bigger reason is globalization. South Asia used to be an insular world where Pakistanis only identified themselves in relation to Indians. It's like a son calling himself a strong liberal because the father is conservative. Now, in a connected world of 7 billion people, they feel irrelevant. Trying to be more Muslim than Arabs only gives them a bad rep. So they're trying to reconnect with the South Asian part of their identity, which explains all the attention they give to Indian content creators. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'iruhx2'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iruhx2/have_you_noticed_how_pak_internet_users_are/</li>

There's no new words are added in our languages, there's no national or international level dictionary and vocabulary for Indian languages, there's no high level talks in Indian languages, there's no environment for growth of Indian languages. In next 2 generations many Indian languages are going to extinct and most bigger languages will be at the edge. And knowing this is saddest part for me.\n\nWe might be last generation who can understand Indian languages without any English word."<br />Author: 'newaccountforgmail'  id: 'irfr9f'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/irfr9f/languages_sanskrit_and_telugukannada_and_malyalam/</li>

I’m fine with this- I work from home and don’t leave my house often. I have traditional Indian jewelry (mangalsutra + thaali) she’s like me to continue to wear as well. My husband is South Indian.\n\nMy question is - is this going to be seen as a problem? We have a pretty large Indian community where I live and I don’t want anyone to think I’m culturally appropriating or anything. I have a decent sized Instagram, and when I posted pictures of my wedding mehindi or of me in a saree I had multiple people tell me I was culture stealing or appropriating and I would like to avoid that all together. \n\nAny thoughts/comments/etc would be appreciated!

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.8'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What are the symptoms of a sādhu (holyman) ? What is the main reason for Lord\'s appearance ?**\n\n.\n\n**Answer 1 :** "According to Bhagavad-gītā, a sādhu (holyman) is a man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kṛṣṇa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a sādhu. And duṣkṛtam applies to one who doesn\'t care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such miscreants, or duṣkṛtam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is accepted as sādhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlāda Mahārāja was the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, was the sister of Kaṁsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kṛṣṇa was to be born of them. So Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to deliver Devakī, rather than kill Kaṁsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations."\n\n.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : Who is the incarnation (avatāra) of Godhead for this kali-yuga ? How he is different from other avatāras ?**\n\n.\n\n**Answer 2 :** "The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Kṛṣṇa by the saṅkīrtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of saṅkīrtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upaniṣads, Mahābhārata, Bhāgavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are much attracted by the saṅkīrtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avatāra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord."\n\n.\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.8, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgh34kj8npm51.jpg?width=594&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d34ecd24b85fd1191ce0ab41658990b135cde9d\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Oppenheimer is considered as the “**Father of the atomic bomb**” for their role in the **Manhattan Project**, the World War II,that developed the first nuclear weapon in the world.The first atomic bomb was successfully tested on July,1945, in the **Trinity test in Mexico**. Oppenheimer later said that the idea of Nuclear bomb was originated from the words from the Bhagavad Gita: **“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”** The Nuclear weapons were used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki In August 1945.\n\nAfter the deadliest atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Julius Robert Oppenheimer said this\n\n*"A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent."* \n\n **Importance of Nuclear Energy in India**\n\nSince the discovery of nuclear energy by USA, many countries were actively involved to acquire the nuclear technology to show dominance in global geo-political field.\n\n**Here is the time line of invention of Nuclear Technology by different countries**\n\n* **U.S.** conducted the Castle Bravo test with hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954,\n* **Soviet Union** tested its first nuclear bomb on 29 August 1949 in Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan.Code name was “First Lightning”\n* **The United Kingdom** became the third nation to acquire nuclear technology when it detonated an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane.\n* **France** acquired nuclear weapons on February 13, 1960. A atomic bomb was tested in Algeria.\n* **The People’s Republic of China** became the fifth nuclear power in the world on October 16, 1964.\n\nThe consecutive success of several countries had put pressure on India as well. As India always wanted to play a significant role in world Geo-politics.\n\nBut India could not immediately put enough focus on developing nuclear technology just after the Independence, as India was immersed in deep poverty and illiteracy. India’s primary focus was development at that time.However **Homi Jegangir Bhabha**\xa0 the ‘Father of the Indian nuclear programme’ pioneered and helped India to show it’s supremacy in the world.\n\nThe present scenario is changed.Now India is focused in development through Nuclear energy.Today the **importance of Nuclear Energy** is in different dimension as there are ever rising concerns for the ecosystem which eventually intensified the use sustainable energy through nuclear technology.\n\nNuclear power must be used in full potential to meet rising electricity demand in the country. **Rising fossil fuel prices, increasing pollution** problems are pushing India to align for Nuclear technology in power generation.\n\n**Do you Know?**India delivers a total capacity of 6.7 GWe (Giga Watt Electricity)through Nuclear power.

What was the main reason for Lord Buddha\'s appearance ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bhāgavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmā, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaṁ tu sākṣāt-bhagavat-praṇītam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gītā. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gītā, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bhāgavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avatāra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avatāra unless he is referred to by scriptures."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.7, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjbil117zhm51.jpg?width=638&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ae172bf9594ef0f93949d0854dde5c5ca72206a\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Addressing the contradiction between article 21 and 25 of the Indian constitution due to the existence of Abrahamic faiths in the country'<br />Body: 'Paraphrasing the Article 21 of the India constitution-  No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law, nor shall any person be denied equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of **India**. \n\nNow the Article 25- Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion. (1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion. \n\nAs the Article 21 suggest unless an exception established by a procedure of law, no person shall be deprived of his/her life and personal liberty in both the personal and societal perspective,now this personal liberty is and should logically be extended to all aspects of our life whether it be family, friends, **religion,gender roles** and work etc. but the very existence of the Article 25 and what it suggests befalls as a direct contradiction upon the Article 21 due to the existence of an Abrahamic belief system. To prove this claim,let us look at some extracts from some holy books of the abrahamic faiths-\n\n1) Homosexuality in the Bible-\n\n[Leviticus 20:13](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-13.htm) (cf. 18:22) declares it abominable for a man to lie with another man as with a woman, and both partners are to be executed. The possibility that one party has been coerced is not discussed: both are defiled. \n\n For Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, the story of Sodom[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah)is central to the traditional condemnation of male homosexuality. \n\n \n\n2) In the Qur’an, the somewhat ineffectual Lot of Genesis becomes the Prophet Lut. The Arabic term for homosexual anal intercourse, *liwat*, comes from his name rather as English derived the term sodomy from the name of the town.\n\nAs in Genesis, Lut seems to argue with the men of Sodom over the relative propriety of abusing his daughters or his guests (11:78–79; 15:67–69). More often, though, the emphasis is on his condemnation of lusting after men instead of women (7:80–81; 26:165–66; 27:55; 29:29). In the Quran Lut says:\n\n&gt;*Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.*\n\n The Qur’an (4:16) demands unspecified punishment for men guilty of lewdness together unless they repent.\n\nYet, the Prophet is supposed to have declared that both the active and the passive partner should be subject to the same penalty as for *zina* (illicit heterosexual sex, usually adultery), namely execution by stoning. \n\n *The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you find anyone doing as Lot’s people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done (38:4447).* \n\nBesides the condemnation of Homosexuality,  the Quran also considers a woman\'s opinion worth half a man\'s and describes a dress code that the female members of their society should abide by and the Old testament is hardly any different.\n\nNow this is what results in a direct contradiction between the two articles ,because considering Article 21 as the superior to its 25th counterpart such belief systems that condemn the existence of certain communities and consider their non-believers as "The heathen" or "Infidels" are inherently discriminatory and supremacist and violate the same rights of these communities and non-believers in the name of freedom of religion by the very existence of such ideas, the same rights that Article 21 guarantees and protects are so openly violated by the very existence of such discriminatory and anti-egalitarian ideologies.\n\nNow to curb this issue and remove the contradiction, I leave that upon the reader to decide, which one is more important for you, The Right to Equality and Personal liberty in all aspects of your life (21) or the Right for everyone to be able to practice any religion they want(25) (irrespective of the fact that the religion might be an extremist one in the modern premise of society), because one of them,if a solution has to be worked out,well one of these articles has to curbed to a certain extent! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you realize what the amendment of the preamble during the Emergency to include the word "Secularism" as the very nature of the constitution has done to us!\n\nHave a great day!\n\n*Jai Hind*'<br />Author: 'Ilovephysics123'  id: 'iqnzl2'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iqnzl2/addressing_the_contradiction_between_article_21/</li>

I have started a true crime podcast on bizzare and chilling Indian murder cases where I will tell you the whole story rather than just reporting about the criminals. This podcast is for everyone, a true crime lover or not, who can now listen to cases of brutality of our very own country in an articulate way. Anyone interested in checking it out can do it at:\n\nhttps://anchor.fm/onecurrytorulethemall [Murder Curry Podcast](https://anchor.fm/onecurrytorulethemall) \nOr\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/7JrYj1XrHY1i3VbmLRISga?si=1FD3eYjeQumR1FIlctWAgg\n\nA little bit about my new episode:\nSeema and Renuka, the sinister sisters, who with the help of their catastrophic matriarch, cruelly and in unimaginable ways took the lives of a huge number of young souls from 1990 to 1996. Their story became really distinguished when they were awarded the death penalty in 2001. \n\nI will appreciate your comments and views on my podcast and will take everything as constructive criticism. So please give it a try and give your Indian podcaster boy a lil boost!

A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kṛṣṇa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a sādhu. And duṣkṛtam applies to one who doesn\'t care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such miscreants, or duṣkṛtam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is accepted as sādhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlāda Mahārāja was the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, was the sister of Kaṁsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kṛṣṇa was to be born of them. So Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to deliver Devakī, rather than kill Kaṁsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\n\n.\n\nIn the Caitanya-caritāmṛta of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:\n\n.\n\nsṛṣṭi-hetu yei mūrti prapañce avatare\n\nsei īśvara-mūrti \'avatāra\' nāma dhare\n\nmāyātita paravyome savāra avasthāna\n\nviśve \'avatāri\' dhare \'avatāra\' nāma.\n\n.\n\n"The avatāra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatāra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatāra."\n\n.\n\nThere are various kinds of avatāras, such as puruṣāvatāras, guṇāvatāras, līlāvatāras, śaktyāveśa avatāras, manvantara-avatāras and yugāvatāras-all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avatāras. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vṛndāvana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the Kṛṣṇa avatāra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\n\n.\n\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Kṛṣṇa by the saṅkīrtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of saṅkīrtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upaniṣads, Mahābhārata, Bhāgavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are much attracted by the saṅkīrtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avatāra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the symptoms of a sādhu (holyman) ? What is the main reason of Lord\'s appearance ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : Who is the incarnation (avatāra) of Godhead for this kali-yuga ? How he is different from other avatāras ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/aapujnrhofm51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23bf9fce55af0c4ccb7e9ff4cca982dd39d2a243)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'iqifjj'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iqifjj/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is48/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.6'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What is the difference between Lord\'s body and the body of a living entity ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation-past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.6, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/css506nqvam51.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5b7d7d39feb2caec13f53c2ffc39bd00d3ac8eb\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

My grandma was healthy for the longest time, but things started going south about 2 years ago. This year has been a nightmare. She's had a couple of big falls, hospitalizations, and old age has been catching up with her. As I type, she is mostly bed ridden, except when we put her on the wheelchair to take her to another room etc.\n\nIve been ready for her demise for a long time. What I had no clue about is how tiring caring for her is. My mum and I seem to go through the day in a blur of managing our jobs, doing household chores, and caring for grandma.\n\nAbout my mum first. Life has been tough for her for decades now, and generally for us as a family, it has been paycheque to paycheque every month. These things have worn her down a lot. Being my grandma's primary care giver has been overwhelming for her. She does most of it - from the diaper changes to the feeding. And she has no time for herself - she's missed her medicines, forgets to bathe, doesn't eat at times. Just because she runs out of time or energy.\n\nWith me - I have a very demanding job and I'm past burnt out now. A lot of the heavy lifting around the house, including lifting my grandma and putting her on the wheelchair is done by me. I'm just exhausted guys, and I don't know what to do. Ive stopped eating properly as well, and to be honest, the house seems like a war zone. I'm finding it hard to balance work and my grandma. What's more, I'm getting married next month and my fiance is moving in with us. I'm so scared about how she'll react to the realities of this home - the chaos, the constant rush, the stench of urine soaked diapers, my grandma exclaiming in pain and exhaustion at every move she makes. She knows of what's happening, but the reality might be too much for her. What then?\n\nAnd I've found myself wanting to never have kids because of this - I just don't know if I'll be upto caring for another person like this. It becomes everything your life is about and I don't know if it's just this situation that's bringing it out in me, or if it's just a long hidden thing I didn't know about myself. And I need to figure that out.\n\nWe can't put her in an elderly care home because she'd die without us around. She needs us. We can't even have a stay at home nurse because we're worried about covid\n\nWe're both just sad, lonely, and tired. And we don't know what to do.

He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bhāgavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmā, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaṁ tu sākṣāt-bhagavat-praṇītam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gītā. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gītā, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bhāgavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avatāra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avatāra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same-to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\n\n.\n\nThe principles of the Bhagavad-gītā were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the beginner's arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the main objective of the principles laid down in the Vedas ? What was the main reason for Lord Buddha's appearance ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/3kqz45uxg9m51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9594ab91e38ba3dd3475c72e76f2550d094237e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ipxra0'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ipxra0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is47/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Sadly Indian TV media is a fish market where insanity reigns supreme. Hoping for a change.'<br />Body: '**Problem**:\n\nSome of my favorite TV channel is Republic TV and sadly like all other TV channels Republic and Arnav just create a fish market whenever a debate is hosted. No one including Arnav has any respect to let the other person complete their sentence and everyone speaks on top of everyone. As a result it is almost impossible to listen to anyone. \n\nOn top of this Arnav does a poor job of moderating the panelists, his volume is generally higher than everyone else. And if you are in the camp with opposing views your volume will be lowered much more. This is insanity and poor media coverage.\n\nIn sane countries and sane media outlets debates with opposing voices are held in a respectful manner where very very rarely does anyone speak over someone else. See Al-Jazeera (which even though is pro-islam and anti-India mostly) hosts great panelists and each one gets their voice herd.\n\nNow I understand this basic civil sense is lacking in general public in India and some western countries but is absolutely unacceptable in media. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Solution/Hope**: I hope someone (may be Arnav) will have the balls to implement some kind of structure like giving every panelists 90 seconds to speak their mind and then mute their microphone after warning them at 75 seconds and 85 seconds. While one panelists is speaking then others should be muted. The host should also observe this civility and while a panelist is speaking the host should only speak to issue those warnings verbally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to hear communities thought on this topic as I feel very strongly about it and I am sure others feel it too.'<br />Author: 'iamonkara'  id: 'ipx1wd'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ipx1wd/sadly_indian_tv_media_is_a_fish_market_where/</li>

On reaching Brahma he sees that Brahma was watching a musical performance so he waits patiently for a couple of moments for the performance to finish.\n\nOnce the performance finishes, he walks up to Brahma and presents to him the list of candidates he has shortlisted to marry his daughter. After listening to Kakudmi's request, Brahma smiles and tells him that even the third or fourth generation of those who he has named no longer survive. He explains to him that several generations have passed in the kingdom while the king was waiting for the songsters to finish as time runs differently in Brahmaloka. And everyone that the King has ever known including his wife, ministers, servants, army etc are all long gone.\n\nAlarmed and distraught the King then asks Brahma who now is a worthy match for his daughter given his circumstances. Brahma then tells him that Vishnu is currently incarnate on earth as Balarama and he would be a worthy match for his daughter. Kakudmi thanks Brahma returns back to earth to find that race of men had dwindled in stature, reduced in vigour, and enfeebled in intellect.\n\nSource: https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp093.htm\n\nPS: This is not a claim that ancient hindus knew interstellar travel.

      <li>Title::: 'To all Bhaginis...'<br />Body: "1. Be financially independent (and yes, receiving gifts from your broke boyfriend while keeping your purse shut is not same as financial independence): I mean, women do have to put up with a lot of their husband's crap because they are not financially secure to care of themselves and their children. Not asking you to become Indira Nooyi, but having a stable job always helps.\n\n2. Being a woman doesn't make you God: I don't know where feminists got idea that every word a woman speaks comes straight from God's mouth. Women are human. Yes women are intelligent, courageous but women can also be vindictive, devious or manipulative just like men. I don't understand why should someone be given a free pass just because the person is a woman. This argument is same as oh no he can't do anything wrong. He's a Pisces!\n\n3. No, nice guys are not evil guys who hide their devious intentions under the guise of their niceness, they can be genuinely nice- Listen, it's a woman's choice if she wants to go for a confident, cool guy instead of a plain nice guy but defending that choice with claiming that the nice guy was not actually nice but he simply was faking his niceness to impress is not at all cool. \n\n4. A woman who chooses her family is no less than a career oriented girl: Being a strong woman these days is synonymous with riding bikes, having a huge pay package, drinking, using expletives but if a woman chooses her family or children over her professional ambitions doesn't mean she's weak.\n\n5. Drinking, using expletives, being coarse is not cool, neither for a man nor for a woman: Yes, I know you'll call me Whatsapp Unkill, but I think following basic decency and limits is applicable for both men and women. Drinking, using expletives doesn't make you a strong woman as web series and movies love to portray. \n\n6.

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prakṛti or His form. Prakṛti means nature as well as svarūpa, or one\'s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation-past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun\'s rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency-and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the Bhāgavatam, He appears before His mother as Nārāyaṇa, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Viśvakośa dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between Lord\'s body and the body of a living entity ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/7nur3shgj1m51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6d3f5542a5dd5f40db1e078c7f87a67208638c9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ip8fdv'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ip8fdv/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is46/</li>

The same Ministry for Space and Atomic Energy controls both things. They can use the experience they gain from privatization of space to help guide privatization of nuclear power.\n\nSo clearly, nuclear power is a sensitive area which requires safeguards to protect both public safety and national security. But the same is the case for space too - if we're willing and able to go through the vetting for that on the space side, then why not be willing to do it for nuclear power as well?\n\nSo the manufacture of all sorts of components for the nuclear sector could be opened up for private participation. Nextly, the design of new systems and subsystems could be opened up for private sector participation.  Just as ISRO's testing laboratories and even launch facilities are offered up for private sector usage, likewise facilities from BARC, etc could similarly be offered up for aiding private sector development work. Use of sensitive materials would happen entirely on the premises of the govt facility.\n\nThe overall goal would be to advance the state of civilian nuclear energy technology in India, and even to achieve new efficiencies and cost-savings."<br />Author: 'sanman'  id: 'ip0pt1'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ip0pt1/why_dont_we_liberalize_nuclear_sector/</li>

This is especially clear in how children are raised.\n\nTherefore while parents in the West are more likely to train their kids with "Do you think that was the right thing to do?", an Indian or Pakistani parent is more likely to ask "What will people think if you do that?"\n\nThe exact source gives the exact figures so you can see where Fear+Shame or Shame+Guilt dominates - this map view is intentionally simple and encourages you to dig deeper if you are into cultural anthropology.\n\nSource: [http://theculturetest.com](http://theculturetest.com/?fbclid=IwAR0cbaCKpg2OAgW49j2NdZ36-3QBcnAiKvuP5wivfWPanM0qsBHGPPQMMjw)\n\n[http://honorshame.com/map/](http://honorshame.com/map/?fbclid=IwAR0cbaCKpg2OAgW49j2NdZ36-3QBcnAiKvuP5wivfWPanM0qsBHGPPQMMjw)'<br />Author: 'trollsack2'  id: 'iotsl8'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iotsl8/what_motivates_a_culture/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.4'<br />Body: '**Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvān is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him? (Translation - Bhagavad Gita 4.4)**\n\n**.**\n\n**Question 1 : What Arjuna\'s was asking the above questions (translation) to Lord Krishna ?**\n\n.\n\n**Answer 1 :** "The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that Kṛṣṇa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence. Of course, Kṛṣṇa also appeared as the son of Devakī on this earth. How Kṛṣṇa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Kṛṣṇa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since Kṛṣṇa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kṛṣṇa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers."\n\n.\n\n"A devotee of Kṛṣṇa\'s, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna\'s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature."\n\n.\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.4, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n**.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/999h0wui9xl51.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da87fca2f0146c8d48edcc1ef038393039551371\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nIn the Brahma-saṁhitā we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:\n\n.\n\nadvaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam\n\nādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca\n\nvedeṣu durllabham adurllabham ātma-bhaktau\n\ngovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.\n\n.\n\n(Bs. 5.33)\n\n.\n\n"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda \\[Kṛṣṇa\\], who is the original person-absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees." It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā:\n\n.\n\nrāmādi mūrttiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan\n\nnānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu\n\nkṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo\n\ngovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi\n\n.\n\n(Bs. 5.39)\n\n.\n\n"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda \\[Kṛṣṇa\\], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also."\n\n.\n\nIn the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas: vedeṣu durllabham adurllabham ātma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to the sun-god Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the Gītā cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kṛṣṇa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-ānanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit-whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And, because the Lord\'s body and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, as the Lord explains in the following verse.\n\n.\n\nQuestion 1 : What are the differences between a living entity and the Lord ?\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What references are given from Brahma-saṁhitā in this verse to describe the glories of Lord Krishna ?**\n\n.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 4: Transcendental Knowledge](https://preview.redd.it/cs81hw4toul51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f5cfdd0a37946b62a5b5b6908796475d64624d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ion1ue'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ion1ue/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is45/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Atheism and Ignorance - How much is too much? Atheists, Theists, Science, Religion, and God.'<br />Body: 'Before I begin writing this, I want you to know that **I am an atheist** but just as any sect, there are certain people who have nothing to do with the idealogy but rather just want to spew vitriol.\n\nIn light of the recent events on Twitter, in which Armin Navabi, the self-proclaimed "atheist activist", degraded the Hindu goddess Kali, I decided to write this post to define what is atheism and what is ignorance. Armin and others like him, their views are personal and they don\'t represent all atheists. \n\nAn Atheist, by definition, is a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods. Lack of belief in God and lack of respect are entirely different. The latter just accomplishes you as a prick. \n\nNobody has the right to force their beliefs on others. By constantly attacking people\'s beliefs, by making a mockery of what is sacred to them, regardless of how illogical it seems to you, you are being no different than those religious fanatics who impose their beliefs on others. Some "atheists" think of disproving god as their life\'s mission instead of just letting others be entitled to their opinion, they take it upon themselves and engage in endless arguments on the internet, trolling, making vulgar remarks on religious deities, spitting on the Quran, tearing up the Bhagavad Gita, Quran, Bible, Torah, all just to prove God doesn\'t exist. You\'re not proving anything here other than how immature you are. Armin gained traction not because he disproved God but because he created controversy by hurting the religious sentiments of many people through his childish acts. Using freedom of speech as an excuse to justify your mischief is a weak game. \n\nDoes that mean one should not criticize religious practices? Sure, you can as long as you know that thin line between criticism and insulting. Anyone with minimal intelligence will know this difference. Others, unfortunately, will resort to mudslinging. Religious practices that are regressive or are discriminatory in nature should be criticized to encourage reforms. \n\nIt is only those "atheists" who are either using God as a scapegoat for their own shortcomings, Armin, for example, has no significant achievements to his name or are really ignorant resort to bashing religion. The latter being mostly kids in the age group of 12-17 where to rebel against your parents, your teachers, the society, and every figure of authority is perceived as being "cool". \n\n*Hey bro, guess what? My parents wanted to take me to the temple today but I turned them down*. \n\n*OMG! religious people are so dumb. Imagine getting triggered over an imaginary character*.\n\n*God is just as real as the spaghetti monster hahaha*.\n\nSuch comments are very common in atheist echo chambers where kids validate each other, share memes taking a jab at religion, write rape fantasies about female deities, and enjoy being "edgelords". But such repeated and immature comments, not only irk an average religious person scrolling through the feed but also other atheists who would prefer to have a discussion based on facts and logic.\n\n*There is no proof of God. I believe in science, not fairy tales*.\n\nThis comment is so overused that you can almost always assess the age of the person writing it. Yes, everyone has heard this one before, you aren\'t bringing anything new to the table, and using repeated comments such as these certainly isn\'t going to help strengthen your argument. What\'s worse is these kids who are barely out of high school, having struggled to even draw the structure of an atom, are becoming the mouthpiece of science online, giving their opinions on profound things such as the nature of existence and God. Please do us all a favor and don\'t call your ill-informed, having little to no life experience immature self as an atheist. It makes the rest of us look bad.\n\nI was recently watching Armin\'s stream and as expected, the comment section was a shitshow. You, armchair "atheists" are disgusting, to say the least. Writing rape fantasies about Kali, who is regarded as a mother by Hindus? This didn\'t surprise me at all because when you follow a person who says "There is nothing wrong with incest", this comes naturally. A pinned comment on that video says this:\n\n&gt;I wouldn\'t have even thought of doing this but after seeing these huge number of Hindutva people getting triggered over Armin Navabi\'s sarcastic tweet on Kaali and are going after Armin to insult him and his mother, giving death threats to him and fileing FIR against him, Now I will definitely continue to blaspheme against Hinduism till blasphemy becomes acceptable just like it\'s acceptable in Christianity now,  I used to support Hindutva in past but after this I promise I won\'t ever support Hindutva again,  But still I won\'t ever support any hatred and bigotry towards Hindu people in general.\n\nYou see the problem here? Using freedom of speech when degrading Kali and insulting the religious sentiments of over a billion Hindus was totally acceptable but when people expressed their disagreement, either by insulting him back or lodging a complaint, suddenly they are to blame? What else did you expect would happen? If you have the audacity to make such rubbish statements on the internet, best also be prepared to face the consequences. As the saying goes, "mess with the bull you get the horns".\n\nHinduism is probably the only religion that doesn\'t require you to conform to a belief in God. **Hindu atheist is not an oxymoron**. If you didn\'t know this already, unlike other religions, Hinduism is a way of life. The founder of the Hindutva movement, Veer Savarkar, was himself an atheist. So saying you will continue to blaspheme against Hinduism till it becomes acceptable when you know nil about Hinduism but doing so just by being inspired by a foreign idea is a bad sense of humor on your part.\n\nBefore I end this post, I want everyone to know that, no matter what you believe in, whether its God or science, in the end, all of us are searching for the truth. Each one of us is seeking answers to our existence, the meaning of life, and the beyond. Attacking other\'s faith, no matter the religion, and trash talking on the internet only promotes toxicity. The theists, atheists, agnostics, and everyone else in between, are all on the same boat. The end goal should not be to prove or disprove God but to figure out where exactly do we fit into this cosmic design, and what is the purpose of our existence if at all it does.'<br />Author: '_InsaneM'  id: 'iofnmt'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iofnmt/atheism_and_ignorance_how_much_is_too_much/</li>

My father treats me like an eyesore. He considers me worthless and abuses me emotionally. He calls me bhainsa etc. \nNow comes the interesting part. I have a 25 year old sister who is also doing masters. She is my father's darling. He glosses over her every mistake . My sister is very manipulative and occasionally fights with my mom over petty thing- to the extent that I always get caught in the crossfire. \n\nJust a few instances - I would sleep under mosquito net and would be rudely awakened by my father as to why I didn't put up the net for my sister as well. \nMy father has categorically said that he will distribute his share of properties equally between us but at the same time said that this would exclude any expense incurred over her marriage. \nNow don't get me wrong, I am all for equality but is this justified. \n\nI don't know if you can feel my anguish. I really don't care for my fathers money but it is his principles that bother me. He would never ask me how I am doing but would be spending every moment with my sister jovially. This reverse discrimination coupled with daily abuses has made me very depressed.

How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nArjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe Kṛṣṇa's words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that Kṛṣṇa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Kṛṣṇa. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence. Of course, Kṛṣṇa also appeared as the son of Devakī on this earth. How Kṛṣṇa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Kṛṣṇa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since Kṛṣṇa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kṛṣṇa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, when Kṛṣṇa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by Kṛṣṇa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study Kṛṣṇa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kṛṣṇa when they are spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Kṛṣṇa because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kṛṣṇa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Kṛṣṇa is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha-the eternal form of bliss and knowledge-that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa's, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna's putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What was Arjuna's motive for asking the above questions (translation) to Lord Krishna ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpbiyq65nnl51.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0dfedabef33ae684c1362a494c8c3ad256ecf50\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'io1137'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/io1137/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is44/</li>

However, I would like everyone to know my new position. But, before reading that, it is imperative that everyone must first see this:\n\n[https://twitter.com/ArminNavabi/status/1302656474011885569](https://twitter.com/ArminNavabi/status/1302656474011885569)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Denise35262228/status/1302660369069080578](https://twitter.com/Denise35262228/status/1302660369069080578)\n\nI've come to realize now that atheists are no friends of Non-Muslims. While Islamic terrorists want to eradicate our religion and establish their own, atheists like these guys want to demolish, desecrate and degrade our religious culture, traditions and deities so that the feeling of devotion and respect for the gods vanishes in the devotee's eyes. All because THEY don't believe in God.\n\nThis is how we were persecuted in the past, forced to watch our gods get abused. Now, we have decided it's enough and we are standing up. I was loathe to support this as I thought what Navabi had done was a mistake and he would soon apologize for it. However, the above two examples prove me wrong and shows that their end goal is to decimate our religion by first, degrading and abusing our gods and then expect us to stay silent about it.\n\nConsequently, I have no sympathy for whatever abuse Armin Navabi gets here from. However, I want to know is there any legal way to stop him? Because abusing his mother isn't working. In fact, it has got him more money and he has actually bragged about it. It isn't affecting him in any way. So, does anyone know of any legal ways to stop him from doing this?

So, I thought it was legit and started working there. ( I am very gullible and stupid so I didn't realize it at the time that it was a scam call centre )\n\nI was instructed to call some numbers given on the list provided to me and tell the people who picked up the call that their loan application was approved upto 10,000$ and if they agreed to take the loan then we were to ask them the loan amount they needed... their routing number, account number and other details which was later used by the boss who asked them to secure their loan amount through a 100$ insurance. \n\nSlowly I realized, the list i was given mainly targeted very old people and baited them for loan. The 100$ insurance money was never refunded back to them.\n\nThis was the opening script that I was made to say on call: https://imgur.com/a/gCP71eh\n\nI worked there for a month until I started getting suspicious because the people who were promised loans kept calling back days after the boss said that loans had been given to them and the boss was ignoring their calls after they had send the 100$ or something for insurance. \n\nSo few days ago, I took phone number of one of the lady whose calls were ignored by the boss and secretly called her today. She said that she got scammed of 1500$ in total. My heart was crushed after listening to her.\n\nThat was just one customer. I am pretty sure my boss has scammed many old people in there 70s or 80s baiting them into some personal unsecured loan.\n\nNow, I am feeling really guilty and angry.

Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women\n\nGundagardi is ingrained in Islam and Muslims and they only have turned Hindus into gundas:\n\n&gt;The third thing that is noticeable is the adoption by the Muslims of the gangster’s method in politics. The riots are a sufficient indication that gangsterism has become a settled part of their strategy in politics.\n\n&gt; So long as the Muslims were the aggressors, the Hindus were passive, and in the conflict, they suffered more than the Muslims did. But this is no longer true. The Hindus have learned to retaliate and no longer feel any compunction in knifing a Musalman. This spirit of retaliation bids fair to produce the ugly spectacle of gangsterism against gangsterism\n\nMuslims will never consider non-Muslims their own and their loyalty to the country will always be secondary to loyalty to Islam:\n\n&gt;The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. \n\n&gt;Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin\n\nHarsh criticism of Gandhi of favouring Muslims over Hindus: \n\n&gt;But Mr Gandhi has never protested against such murders. Not only have the Musalmans not condemned these outrages but even Mr Gandhi has never called upon the leading Muslims to condemn them. He has kept silent over them. Such an attitude can be explained only on the ground that Mr Gandhi was anxious to preserve Hindu-Moslem unity and did not mind the murders of a few Hindus if it could be achieved by sacrificing their lives. \n\nIndirectly saying good will come out of Gandhi\'s death because of how big of a liability Gandhi had become for the Congress Party and the country\n\n&gt;My own view is that great men are of great service to their country, but they are also at certain times a great hindrance to the progress of the country. Mr Gandhi had become a positive danger to this country," said Ambedkar.\n\n&gt;"He had choked all the thoughts. He was holding together the Congress which is a combination of all the bad and self-seeking elements in society who agreed on no social or moral principle governing the life of society except the one of praising and flattering Mr Gandhi. Such a body is unfit to govern a country," he added.\n\n&gt;"As the Bible says that sometimes good cometh out of evil, so also I think good will come out of the death of Mr Gandhi. It will release people from bondage to supermen, it will make them think for themselves and compel them to stand on their own merits," Ambedkar wrote.\n\nAmbedkar hated Communism because he believed it was a cult of violence lacking any spirituality or humanity:\n\n&gt;“Buddha would never allow violence, but the communists do. No doubt the communists get quick results because when you adopt the means of annihilating a man, they do not remain to oppose you. Humanity does not only want economic values, it also wants spiritual values to be retained. Permanent communist dictatorship has paid no attention to spiritual values and does not seem to intend to. Carlyle called political economy a pig philosophy. Carlyle was of course wrong. For man needs material comforts. But the communist philosophy seems to equally wrong, for the aim of their philosophy seems to be fatten pigs, as though men are no better than pigs. Man must grow materially as well as spiritually. Buddha’s method was to change the mind of man without the use of force. Buddha sought to change man’s moral disposition to follow the path voluntarily. The means adopted by the communists are equally clear short and swift; one is violence and second is dictatorship of the proletariat,” he said.\n\nCommunists failed in India because they were ultimately just a club of Brahmin boys:\n\n&gt;The Communist Party was originally in the hands of some Brahmin boys –  Dange and others. They have been trying to win over the Maratha community and the Scheduled Castes. But they have made no headway in Maharashtra. Why ? Because they are mostly a bunch of Brahmin boys. The Russians made a great mistake to entrust the Communist movement in India to them. Either the Russians didn’t want Communism in India – they wanted only drummer boys – or they didn’t understand. \n\nHe did very clearly did not believe in Communism:\n\n&gt;Dr. B. R. Ambedkar said that his party would not in any case align with the Communist Party “for the plain reason that I do not believe in Communism,”\n\n"Religion is essential for the progress of mankind" - 1956 speech when he renounced Hinduism for Buddhism\n\n&gt;“Religion is a very necessary thing for the progress of mankind. I know that a sect has appeared because of the writings of Karl Marx. According to their creed, religion means nothing at all. Religion is not important to them. They get breakfast in the morning, of bread, cream, butter, chicken legs, etc.; they get undisturbed sleep, they get to see movies and that’s all there is. This is their philosophy. I am not of that opinion.”\n\nLet\'s go back to a time before he and a group of Dalits who were trying to enter a temple in Uttarakhand were stoned by upper caste people:\n\n&gt;"Hindutva belongs as much to the untouchable Hindus as to the touchable Hindus. To the growth and glory of this Hindutva contributions have been made by Untouchables like Valmiki, the seer of Vyadhageeta, Chokhamela and Rohidas as much as by Brahmins like Vashishta, Kshatriyas like Krishna, Vaishyas like Harsha and Shudras like Tukaram."\n\nHere\'s his opinion of including non-Hindu Dharmics into the Hindu code when he was drafting the Constitution:\n\n&gt;"Application of Hindu code to the Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains was a historical development and it would be too late sociologically to object to it. When the Buddha differed from the Vedic Brahmins, he did so only in matters of creed and left the Hindu legal framework intact. He did not propound a separate law for his followers. The same was the case with Mahavir and the ten Sikh Gurus"\n\nSounds exactly like Savarkar\'s definition of Hindu:\n\nआसिंधु सिंधु पर्यन्ता यस्य भारतभूमिका । पितृभू: पुण्यभूश्चैव स वै हिंदुरिति स्मृत: ॥ \n\nTranslation: Those who consider the land between Sindhu sagara and Sindhu (Indus) river in Bharatabhumi as their holy land and fatherland is a Hindu.'<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'inqf5g'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/inqf5g/why_is_लबरणड_समदय_latching_onto_ambedkar/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why FAU-G is a HOAX? From the perspective of European AAA game developer.'<br />Body: 'I know there is a huge discussion around this "Project". Also controversy that PUB-G was banned, and now this thing is being produced. I needed to share my thoughts about this as a AAA game developer.\n\nWhen a serious game company decides to reveal information about their project they show a teaser that will \'sell\' the mood of the game, setting, gameplay, etc. depending of how advanced the production is. Even when is not much to show, they have game design document, rough prototypes of mechanics. One is sure, no real gamedev company uses bought stock content to promote their game.\n\nAnd here we begin - a **Twitter** post ( [https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19](https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19) ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j657rlui3kl51.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81da297d76aa27e3f9a4a8b22b43069726a3b61b\n\nThere is absolutely no information about the game. There is one word "Action Game" which can define games from Pac Man to Mortal Combat. Also from other twitter posts we can learn that game will teach about "sacrifices of our soldiers". I guess it\'s about sacrifices of Indian soldiers - so... it is perfectly normal to make a teaser poster of game with stock photo of American Soldiers ( [www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350) ). There is also a word "soon" - we will get to that later.\n\nSo how we know it will be a PUBG clone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex9v54yx3kl51.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f6e9d1fd8fe916315593ab5e62aeeb58fdd95ff\n\nAnd that\'s all info relating to PUBG. But lets assume FAUG will be actually a PUBG clone.\n\nAfter the teaser poster comes **TRAILER** uploaded at nCORE Games youtube channel ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXv2jazfXT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXv2jazfXT0) )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d12aldry3kl51.png?width=1203&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9921a7423c4988b26ee22751b099aa526a7904e0\n\nAnd what happened? From modern time USA we jumped to Second World War, in Europe. There is European architecture from those times, guns, vehicles, etc. And people are talking in Polish there ( I was surprised to hear my mother language in Indian game trailer, and this made me intrigued. And here I am, disappointed ). BTW HALT means STOP in German.\n\nConclusions for now - nCORE Games, has absolutely no content and no idea how the game should and will look like. They use stock materials to promote non existing project.\n\nLet\'s move on and assume they actually know what game they are making. So we will see the **Company Portfolio**, just to see if they can deliver. " nCore Games - Leading mobile game publishers " we start good but there aren\'t any games at all in their portfolio. The team doesn\'t have ANY game developer, just CEO, COO, Investors, Director..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wf8og8z3kl51.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb90ad76ef60b2da4bc1e2118d743874840a9db2\n\nSite says they are mobile games developer, so lets see Google Play store ( [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&amp;hl=en) )\n\nTheir profile shows only one game (1.9 rated) which is Unity made Asteroids game clone. I won\'t say I am surprised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju7dfuw14kl51.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44e3dedce60877df2cd64dc55186f3ef479f680\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80rkeje24kl51.png?width=1663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a1c68237d1fa133248e7d65ac8c8f2508a07266\n\nI have been told that this game falls under "Make in India" umbrella. Maybe Vishal Gondal was able to create such crew out of people working in Indian AAA/AA game development studios? I used well known list on Wikipedia to find how many studios are there ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_video\\_game\\_developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_developers) ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olnsqs734kl51.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10f9ab2286ff8999d93e52c60dc05ee2ad4be3a\n\nAnd I found out there is only one AAA studio - Rockstar India. I googled a little to get other lists and found this - [https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india](https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india). Rest of companies are quite small, not able to create such big project and not experienced enough.\n\nHow this game will be made in India and when, if there are no AAA gamedev companies in India (besides Rockstar) who can make a game that they showed in game trailer. Or they will outsource the game project to any foreign AAA studio under name of Indian nCore company and call it an "Indian Game".\n\nNow let me tell you what it takes to make game similar to what they showed in FUBg teaser.\n\nIt is very complex proces that needs time, iteration and good design. Making a AA or AAA game takes years to make. For example Call of Duty game serie has 3 year development cycle. The newest production is made by two huge studios - Raven Software and Treyarch. Treyarch only has 600 people.  ( [https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know) )\n\nFor PUBG, data say it was process of 1-2 years of development. To release FAUG \'soon\' game would need to be in production for about a year already with a team of not 6 directors but at least 50 developers.\n\nAll of this made me think that this game won\'t be released ever or this won\'t be a PUBG clone but some simple shooter game, that will be released and forgotten very fast.'<br />Author: 'Torn-TheArchitect'  id: 'inpc0o'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/inpc0o/why_faug_is_a_hoax_from_the_perspective_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Which is the true border between South Asia and the Middle East?'<br />Body: "I'm talking about a border that marks a clear distinction between both territories and civilizations. \n\nThe first choice is obviously the internationally recognized border, where Pakistan and Afghanistan are inside South Asia and Iran in the Middle East. But geographically and culturally, this border seem flawed. There's a reason why SAARC for example will never be as united as the EU or ASEAN. \n\nThe second choice is the India-Pakistan border. This is not entirely baseless because there must be a reason as to why Islam, the religion of the Middle East, expanded all the way to the Indus river and didn't quite succeed further East. Today, the people of the Indus territory have a very antagonistic relationship with people towards their East, perhaps this also isn't a coincidence. \n\nThe third choice is a geographical one, which is the Hindu Kush mountain range. East of this range experiences monsoon, west of it is primarily a desert. Personally, I believe that this marks the true border. If its true, and if geography determines destiny, then we can predict that in the long-term future, Pakistanis will get closer to Indians while Afghans get closer to Persians and Arabs."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'innrtl'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/innrtl/which_is_the_true_border_between_south_asia_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 4.2'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Why the Lord felt the need to reestablish the disciplic succession ? What are the defects in the interpretations on Bhagavad-gita rendered by different mundane scholars ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "It is clearly stated that the Gītā was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly Bhagavad-gītā was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one\'s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the Gītā appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the Gītā (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the Gītā in English, as it is received by the paramparā (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. Bhagavad-gītā-accepted as it is-is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 4.2, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3oxq0s80fjl51.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1899ee98d20155e12b85cf004fc159629a760bbe\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Sunday Debate] The concurrent list should be discontinued and all topics contained in it should be shifted to the state list'<br />Body: 'The power to make laws on various issues in India is a shared responsibility of centre and states. This is determined by 3 lists, the Union List, the State List and the Concurrent List. The subjects in the Union List, such as defence, railways, citizenship, etc. are the subjects on which only the Union government can makes laws. \n\nSimilarly, laws governing subjects in the state list such as Public order, Public health, police, regulations on intoxicating liquors, etc. can only be made by state governments. The concurrent list is a set of subjects which are the shared responsibility of state and union government. A law made on any concurrent list subject by the Union government automatically overrules any law that exists or may be passed by any state governments on the same subject. \n\nSince 1947, the union and concurrent lists have been growing while the state list has been shrinking. The most significant was the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976, during the Emergency, that moved several subjects, most importantly education, to the concurrent list from the state list. \n\nOver the years, this has led to dissatisfaction in some quarters at the erosion of state autonomy and the federal structure of the constitution, especially the power of the Union government to pass an act that will supersede any and all state laws on subjects in the Concurrent List. \n\nThe motion proposes that the concurrent list should be discontinued and subjects should either be the exclusive purview of the central government or various state governments. \n\nSome points [For] the motion - Increase in regional autonomy, deepening federalism, a central law may not cater to specific state conditions and cultures. Concurrent list gives excess power in hands of centre vis-a-vis states\n\nSome points [against] the motion - Concurrent list enables uniformity of policies on important topics across the country.

      <li>Title::: "The Wire just put out an article that tells India that we need to bow down and do whatever China demands. And I'm not surprised."<br />Body: '#[TLDR: "surrender to China"](https://i.redd.it/hmjjj8tfedl51.jpg)\n\nThe entire thing is LITERALLY regurgitating straight up Chinese propaganda.\n\n###Let me narrate it to you along with some excerpts and the \'proposed solutions\':\n\n______________\n\nFirst the author talks about how he\'s old af, and how this is exactly like 1962. Many similarities are listed. Okay. Cool.\n\nStarts to list out official statements made by Chinese officials. "scary drumroll intensifies"\n\nProceeds to reproduce large sections of an entire Global Times article. 500 words of just direct copypasta of a Global Times article with no questions asked, or even a sentence of analysis.\n\n&gt;Its last paragraph is a chilling warning against India continuing to pursue what it considers its present adventurism:\n\n&gt;&gt;*“China is an immovable neighbour and much stronger than India. The two countries are suitable to be partners in seeking common development. But if New Delhi wants to label Beijing its long-term strategic rival, it needs to be prepared to pay a huge cost. In the meantime, it will never manage to get one more inch of land at China-India border areas.”*\n\n&gt;Excepting the last paragraph, the arguments presented in the rest of the article are ones that I have presented more than once in these columns, most recently **in collaboration with an eminent Chinese intellectual**, Victor Gao. \n\nWah. So you\'ve been collaborating with a \'Chinese intellectual\' and peddling Chinese propaganda here? Fantastic! Thanks for letting us know.\n\nNow here\'s where it gets interesting:\n\n&gt;**If the writer of the Global Times article is sincere, and if he reflects Beijing’s strategic thinking accurately, then war in the Himalayas is the last thing China wants.**\n\nNotice how smoothly he defers to the *assumption* of Chinese sincerity.\n\n&gt;What it does want is an assurance that the present regime in India will not, either for its own domestic, ideological, and political reasons, or to curry favour with its newfound ‘defence partner’ the United States, recreate conflicts with China that the Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh governments had laid to rest. Beyond that, Beijing still wants to resume the strategic and economic cooperation that the Modi government has, so unthinkingly, disrupted. \n\nNotice how casually he handwaves away any possibility of Modi govt\'s sincerity, and places the entire blame squarely on \'India\' (under Modi). China is innocent. Modi\'s India is guilty. China is sincere. Modi\'s India \nhas it\'s selfish "motivations".\n\nThe entire article, at no point, questions ***"what if the GT article is NOT sincere?"*** The entire article at no point gives the *benefit of doubt*, or frankly, *even an iota of credibility*, to Indian forces, or the Indian govt.\n\n&gt;Responsible statesmanship requires that India take both Beijing’s official hardline statements, and its unofficial reiteration of cooperation, seriously.\n\nIf you don\'t meekly heed China\'s stick-and-carrot, you are irresponsible. China strong. China merciful. China like Allah. Bow to Chinallah.\n\n&gt;For weeks, since his June 19 statement that China had not seized any (undisputed) Indian territory, Modi has been quietly trying to recover the hyper-nationalist political ground he lost then by reinforcing the armed forces in Ladakh and declaring a covert economic war on China through trade and investment sanctions, while playing quietly with peacocks in his garden. \n\n&gt;This policy has reached the end of its pre-destined road. \n\nOh my. Note in this entire article the author makes no mention of our 20 soldiers who were killed in Galwan. Note that Salami slicing features nowhere. Suddenly Wire articles about 10 billion sqkm captured by China are replaced with Chinese innocence and patience with a troublesome India.\n\n&gt;Prime Minister Modi may still be hoping for a Chinese pullback that he can again describe as a victory to his subjects, as he did after Doklam. But as Global Times explicitly reminds us, this is not going to happen.\n\nGlobal Times knows all. Global times is trustworthy. You can take their word for it. Modi is untrustworthy though. He plays with peacocks.\n\n&gt;So he now has to choose between a war that, given the forbidding terrain and its remoteness from supply bases and cantonments, India is pre-destined to lose, and accepting the hand of friendship that China still appears willing to extend.\n\nWow. I am in awe. My Chinese masters are so merciful! We must accept the carrot, otherwise the stick is inevitable, and we are **PRE-DESTINED** to lose, should we resist. *"We have military power, allies, and geographic advantage"*, you say? NO. China is supreme. They said it. It is the word of Chinallah. The word of Chinallah is the Truth. \n\n"the hand of friendship that China still appears willing to extend." - In his 900 years of life, the author also seems to not have heard of Chinese Debt Trap diplomacy, or the 23 odd border conflicts that China has with every nation.\n\n#Solutions proposed very helpfully:\n\n&gt;If Modi decides to do the latter ***[accept China\'s benevolent carrot - their "hand of friendship"]*** he can still do so, without making any humiliating concessions, through the following initiatives:\n\nSaving face! What an *adorable* Chinese concept.\n\n&gt;1) Recognise explicitly, and remind the Indian public though the TV and media, that there have always been different interpretations of the Line of Actual Control; and hold China responsible for preventing their reconciliation through an exchange of maps;\n\n"First say sorry in front of the whole class, rinku. Say it was all a misunderstanding."\n\n&gt;2) Inform the Indian public that despite this, repeated non-violent confrontations between rival patrols over the years in certain areas have enabled us to identify 23 such “grey” areas and that all of the five points of confrontation this summer fall within them; \n\n... aaaaand what have the violent confrontations allowed us to identify?\n\n&gt;3) Give an immediate and public assurance to China that there will be no further troop deployments in the area provided China is willing to do the same. This is necessary because vaguely worded agreements between corps commanders have not only failed to inspire confidence but given armchair military experts a field day for representing them as concessions born out of weakness – just the allegation Modi cannot tolerate.\n\nOh boy. We get to withdraw unilaterally after saying sorry! I\'m so excited to see this day. Guess what, China needs to make no such assurance! It\'s amazing. After all, how can God be wrong? That would be blasphemy.\n\n&gt;4) Resume talks at the highest level – between external affairs minister Jaishankar and state councillor Wang Yi , to reassure China that while India may not be happy with the creation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and has disagreements in principle with its being located in Gilgit, it recognises that CPEC’s purpose is to facilitate trade, and has no intention whatever of disrupting, or allowing its territory to be used to disrupt, that trade.\n\nLook! CPEC is benign and so good! Unlike fascist hypernationalist Modi and our weak and vain armed forces. We trust in China! We trust in Xi! We are good obedient servants of Xitler! \n\nOhhhh man. These 4 steps deserve a galaxy-brain meme to themselves. ***Immediately***. \n\nBasically, if you do not kneel to your master, how will you take his *carrot* into your mouth? You must soothe their hurt pride, massage their egos, and agree to bow down to them as they walk past. \n\n&gt;These four mutual assurances, if given publicly so that they can be viewed as a form of contract, will end the confrontation in Ladakh and ensure peace in the immediate future. \n\nOh this is only *temporary*! Just enough for the *immediate* future! Well damn... I wonder what would bring about a PERMANENT solution.... oh wait here it is...\n\n&gt;But to ensure a **permanent** peace and open the way to the economic cooperation that China wants it is necessary for the two governments to take **two additional steps:**\n\n&gt;1) First, in its own interest, India should lift all the economic sanctions through which it has tried to punish China for its sudden change of the status quo in Ladakh this summer. \n\nOh returning to our massive trade deficit with China is "for our own good", is it? Amazing. We\'ll get back to that pronto.\n\n&gt;2) Finally, since China will not, or cannot, explain its reluctance to exchange maps, would it not be better to bypass this issue altogether by agreeing to a modified version of the proposal first put to Pandit Nehru by Zhou Enlai in 1960 – **that the two countries move, or keep, all permanent military installations back 10 or more kilometres from not only the LAC but the 23 “grey” areas and declare this a Zone Of Peace open to locals from both sides of the border to graze their sheep and goats, to cultivate, or trade in?**\n\nAmazing! An offering to the Gods! We should just demilitarize the whole area, and China will obviously do the same! There\'s no way they won\'t! They are Gods!\n\n&gt;There is so much for both countries to gain from peace and so much to lose from war, that to even think of a relationship that is based upon permanent antagonism is a form of insanity.\n\nYes. We must be mad to not trust China. We are insane. Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai after all! We must scrap our army forthwith. Who needs dirty soldiers. We will grow primroses at the border!\n\n&gt;The Chinese seem to understand this and have been repeating it since 2009, if not 1993. It is time for India do the same, and for both countries to act upon what they have so far only professed.\n\nOf cooouuurrrse! How stupid of us! When their troops were waltzing dozens of kilometers into Arunachal or Ladakh, they were coming to find our troops and share the latest momo recipes! We must understand! Global Times is the trustworthy voice of God!\n\n#And these people have the temerity to call us andhbh-kts 🤣'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'ingdpq'<br />Score:489<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ingdpq/the_wire_just_put_out_an_article_that_tells_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How is India positioned as an alternative to China in the Global Supply Chain?'<br />Body: "Let's compare India to Bangladesh first and check which country has a greater potential to form a Manufacturing Hub and a Global Supply chain   \n   \nA. Financing - Bangladesh handles Third Party Guarantees since 2016. Every single deal of theirs has Third Party Guarantees by Foreign (US or European Banks) Banks like UBS   \n   \nIndia has only Two-Party Guarantees by SBI which has a credibility of around 60% of a Foreign Swiss or European Bank.   \n   \nB. Labor - 43.25% of the Bangladeshi Workers out of the General worker's pool are Skilled Workers which translates to 20.75% of the General Labor Pool (The Figure is 68.80% for China and 87.65% for the USA)   \n   \nOnly 19.65% of the Indian Workers out of the General worker's pool are Skilled workers which translate to 4.69% of the General Labor Pool\nBangladesh has almost 5 times the Skilled Labor that India has in terms of percentage   \n   \nBy the way - the figures were 3.47% in 1997 and 3.15% in 1997 for Bangladesh and India respectively. They were almost side by side but in the last 23 years - Bangladesh has increased its Skilled Labor Pool by 7 times while India has barely increased their pool by a measly 1.22%.   \n   \nC. Favourable Laws - Bangladesh has 37 laws and regulations protecting the Foreign Investor which includes a 5 Year Currency Forward Option, 5 Year Currency Remittance Option, Insurance by Investors Insurers with Deposits by Bangladeshi Companies, Dual Jurisdiction with Bangladeshis accepting the Foreign Judges Verdict.     \n     \nIndia has no such law. There are no currency forwarding Option, No Currency remittance option beyond the $ 400,000 a year for everyone and every firm - or else the PMLA and FEMA acts will jump on you. No Insurance options and No Dual Jurisdiction. All Arbitrations will be in the hand of Indian Judges with an average of 11 years.     \n   \nBangladesh even has more controlled PILs than India does.    \n    \nD. Bond Ratings - Bangladesh Bonds have Junk Rating but surprise, surprise Indian Bonds have BBB- which is one level above Junk rating. Bangladesh was B- in 2007 and have moved up to BB- by 2020, Indian Bonds were A in 2007 and now BBB- which represents a step-down.\nThis suggests that Bangladesh has received a boost in confidence while India has received a massive loss of confidence.  \n   \nE. Growth of Sectors - Bangladesh Power and Infrastructure sector has surged with a Project completion ratio of almost 71.52% (71.52% of projects completed) no matter who is in power since 2015.  \n\nIndian Power and Infrastructure Sector has bottomed out with a completion ration of 24.33% (Only 24.33% Projects completed) since 2015.  \n\nSo even Bangladesh is a better contender for Global Supply Chain than India is.\n\nIndia has to first beat Bangladesh, then Vietnam, then China - to reach that spot.  It's like the Afghanistan Cricket Team hoping to defeat the Indian Cricket Team and win the World Cup.  First, you have to defeat UAE, then Ireland, then West Indies, then Pakistan, then Australia and finally India.\n\nSources\n**[Foreign Labour Market: Sustainability Through Skilled Labour - LightCastle Partners.](https://www.lightcastlebd.com/insights/2020/01/05/foreign-labour-market-sustainability-through-skilled-labour#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DAs%20of%202018%2C%2043.25%25%20of%2Cas%20opposed%20to%2038.55%25%20unskilled.%26text%3DThis%20is%20a%20very%20encouraging%2Cworkers%20all%20over%20the%20world)**    \n**[Explained: Gap between Skill India goals and current status](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/skill-india-why-there-is-a-gap-between-current-status-and-goals-explained/1520633/)**  \n**[Protection of Foreign Investments in Bangladesh: Laws and Policy](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/protection-of-foreign-investments-in-bangladesh-laws-and-policy-50563**"<br />Author: 'snooshoe'  id: 'in9jzy'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/in9jzy/how_is_india_positioned_as_an_alternative_to/</li>

Nearly 400 million people are unfed daily. It has many challenges like poverty, inequality, discrimination, and more. It has many positives like cheap-skilled labour market, spiritual tools, a booming economy, ancient wisdom, diversity, intricate culture, etc.\n\n**Optimistic Indian:** Any Indian is free to feel pride about his land and be passionate about its future and prospects. Many Indians have immense pride in their culture and heritage and believe it has much to reform and offer back to the world.\n\n**Pessimistic Indian:** Indians who believe there is no bright future for India. There is nothing significant to be prideful about our Ancient Heritage and Culture. We have much to learn from the developed nations and perhaps follow their footsteps.\n\n# Government Identity\n\n**Neutral-Government:** An equal space for support and opposition of Government whenever required. Both sides of a topic are encouraged for debate.\n\n**Pro-Government**: There is no space for negative criticism. Every topic is seen from the lens of good governance.\n\n**Anti-Government:** There is no space for constructive criticism. Every topic is seen from the lens of bad governance.\n\n# My Assessment of r/IndiaSpeaks\n\nOptimistic *Indian + Neutral/Pro-Government*\n\n# Request to Mods\n\n***The very fact that NO opinions from various sides of the spectrum are not available deeply reflects on the quality of moderation of this subreddit***.

Indian security agencies have collected inputs indicating that Turkey-based handlers, with apparent government help from Ankara, had supported a group of Indian terrorists traveling to Syria and fighting for ISIS' global terrorist network there, Zee News sources. This reality was reestablished by the recent arrests of ISIS terrorists in India, as they admitted to entering Syria via Turkey and returning along the same path. Handlers centered out of Turkey facilitated their entry to ISIS, the news channel announced. The Indian Security agencies are becoming greatly concerned about anticipating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's utilization of\xa0Pakistan-based terror groups to thump India and boost its prominence among South Asian Muslims, Zee News sources.\n\nSecurity experts agree that India needs to concentrate on Turkey's escalated activities inside India on a par with its attention on the conflicts that arise from it at the global forum. Erdogan's alliance with militant groups and attempts to advance the radical Islamist agenda has also begun to influence India. The article on the news channel said democracies around the world have to come together to address the geopolitical challenges that arise from Turkey.

But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.\n.\n.\nPURPORT\n.\nIt is clearly stated that the Gītā was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly Bhagavad-gītā was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the Gītā appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the Gītā (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the Gītā in English, as it is received by the paramparā (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. Bhagavad-gītā-accepted as it is-is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time.\n.\nQuestion 1 : Why the Lord felt the need to reestablish the disciplic succession ? What are the defects in the interpretations on Bhagavad-gita rendered by different mundane scholars ?\n .\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'imy16t'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/imy16t/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is42/</li>

This science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.\n\n.\n\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvān, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-saṁhitā it is stated:\n\n.\n\nyac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ\n\nrājā samasta-sura-mūrttir aśeṣa-tejāḥ\n\nyasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kālacakro\n\ngovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi\n\n.\n\n"Let me worship," Lord Brahmā said, "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda \\[Kṛṣṇa\\], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order."\n\n.\n\nThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasvān) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Kṛṣṇa originally made Vivasvān His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-gītā. The Gītā is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial. In the Mahābhārata (Śānti-parva 348.51-52) we can trace out the history of the Gītā as follows:\n\n.\n\ntretā-yugādau ca tato vivasvān manave dadau\n\nmanuś ca loka-bhṛty-arthaṁ sutāyekṣvākave dadau\n\nikṣvākuṇā ca kathito vyāpya lokān avasthitāḥ\n\n.\n\n"In the beginning of the Tretā-yuga \\[millennium\\] this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the King of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared. Therefore, Bhagavad-gītā existed in the human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku."\n\n.\n\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvāpara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tretā-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to his disciple and son Mahārāja lkṣvāku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gītā was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the Gītā was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gīta, according to the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvān because he is also a kṣatriya and is the father of all kṣatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas. Because Bhagavad-gītā is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruṣeya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the Gītā must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gītā in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gītā as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-gītā has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the responsibilities of the royal order/executive heads of all states ? How they can execute them with the help of Bhagavad-gītā ?** \n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What is an estimate of the history of the Gita ?

But a Bangalore based startup announced the release in less than 2 days. \n\nRumours on Twitter are that it is a properly planned and executed stunt under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Scheme and critics believe it to be another stunt pulled by the Modi government as 20% of the net revenue generated will be donated to Bharat ke Veer - a fund managed by the PM Team with no clarity over the details. \n\nWhat are you thoughts? \n\nPS: requesting you all to ignore grammatical/ spelling mistakes.'<br />Author: 'OldStrawberryandpot'  id: 'imf6iy'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/imf6iy/faug_a_well_executed_stunt_by_indian_govt_after/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In April to June 2021, India May Grow by 15-30%, But We’ll Still Be Catching Up'<br />Body: 'Summary: Base effect – The collapse in GDP during the April to June 2020 is going to make the GDP growth during April to June 2021 look fantastic.\n\nI want to make a prediction here. And this is a fairly easy one.\n\nA year from now, in early September 2021, you will see a spate of WhatsApp forwards and social media posts, which will say that India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.\n\nAnd unlike most other times, when WhatsApp forwards and the social media are either trying to outrightly lie and if not that, then at least trying to mislead, this time around they will be 100% correct.\n\nAll that will happen is the base effect will come into play. Now what’s the base effect? Instead of me giving you a definition and confusing you, let’s try and understand this in some detail, but in a simple way.\n\nFor the period April to June 2020, the Indian gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of economic size, was at Rs 26.9 lakh crore. This was 23.9% lower than the GDP during the period April to June 2019, which was at Rs 35.4 lakh crore. Hence, the GDP came down by a massive Rs 8.5 lakh crore.\n\nThe major reason for this was the massive contraction of 26.7% in private consumption, in comparison to April to June 2019. Over and above this, the investment in the economy contracted by 47.1%.\n\nGiven that consumption and investment are two major parts of the economy, it is hardly surprising that the economy contracted by as much as it did.\n\nNevertheless, as the economy opens up and people gradually go back to doing things like they always used to, the private consumption number is bound to improve gradually. The investment in the economy will also go up albeit at a much slower pace.\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that even before covid struck, the Indian industry had excess capacity and the capacity lying idle has gone up post covid.\n\nThis will ensure that the GDP figure for the current and the next two quarters will improve. By the time April to June 2021 comes around India will be in growth territory and that too a massive one.\n\nThe GDP during April to June 2021 is bound to be much more than the GDP during April to June 2020 (unless there is a lockdown of similar proportions). This is where things get interesting.\n\nLet’s see what the GDP growth in April to June 2021 is likely to be at various levels of GDP in comparison to the GDP of Rs 26.9 lakh crore in April to June 2020. The chart plots various scenarios.\n\nAs can be seen from the above chart, the GDP growth figure is likely to be very high for the period April to June 2021.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 30 lakh crore, the growth will be 11.5%. But in absolute terms we will still be where we were in April to June 2016, when the GDP was at Rs 29.7 lakh crore. So, we will be around five years behind.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 31 lakh crore, the growth will be 15.2%. But in absolute terms we will still be where we were in April to June 2017, when the GDP was at Rs 31.4 lakh crore. So, we will be around four years behind.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 32 lakh crore, the growth will be 19%.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 33 lakh crore, the growth will be 22.7%.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 34 lakh crore, the growth will be 26.4%. But in absolute terms we will still be where we were in April to June 2018, when the GDP was at Rs 33.6 lakh crore. So, we will be around three years behind.\n\nIf the GDP were to recover to Rs 35 lakh crore, the growth will be 30.1%. But in absolute terms we will still be where we were in April to June 2019, when the GDP was at Rs 35.4 lakh crore. So, we will be around two years behind.\n\nIn exact terms, India needs to grow by greater than 31.6% in April to June 2021 to be able to cross where we were in April to June 2019. Even in the most optimistic scenario, covid has probably cost us two years of growth.\n\nHence, the growth in April to June 2021 will look fantastic. And that’s simply because the GDP in April to June 2020 simply collapsed. This collapse will lead to the GDP growth April to June 2021 looking very good. And this, dear readers, is nothing but the base effect at play. Also, if the GDP figure for April to June 2020 gets revised downwards, as it is likely to be, then the growth figure will look even better.\n\nGiven this, the GDP growth numbers during 2021-2022, the next financial year, will have to be taken with a pinch of salt. The numbers from April to June 2022 onwards will tell us the real story about economic growth being back on track or not.\n\nOf course, given that most of us do not understand basic fifth standard mathematics or simply choose to ignore it, we will buy into this massive double-digit growth story.\n\nYes, we did it. It’s always been more fun to believe in rhetoric than use the brain. And a year down the line in history isn’t going to change that.\n\nSource - https://vivekkaul.com/2020/09/04/in-april-to-june-2021-india-may-grow-by-15-30-but-well-still-be-catching-up/'<br />Author: 'panditji_reloaded'  id: 'imba5b'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/imba5b/in_april_to_june_2021_india_may_grow_by_1530_but/</li>

Trigonometry\n\n**Saltpeter**\n\nSaltpeter is a key ingredient in making gun powder, it provides the required oxygen in solid form to form a heavy/quick combustion. Bharath was the only source of saltpeter back then and the export of it without doing a "Poorvapaksha" to understand what it is being used for was a mistake.\n\n**Trigonometry**\n\nTrigonometry is essential to calculate the ballistic trajectories and Navigation, which helped those to travel to the Americas and occupy and control the trade and develop better military and gain experience.\n\n**Other Thoughts,**\n\nAlso, currently the heavy export of iron ore from Bharath to China and Japan has funded their development of infrastructure, Iron ore is cheap while the end machinery are as much as 100 to 10,000 times more expensive to import from those same countries.\n\nThings make country develop are, by far the number one is Steel, as it is used in machineries, buildings, military, bridges, dams as primary input. Number two is a capable work force that can convert these ingredients into products that satisfy the needs of end users and further the goals of Rashtra. Number three is power, power to move these machinery/tools it may be man power or electrical power or nuclear power.\n\nIt is only during the term of BJP after 2014 the export of raw iron has been discouraged, infrastructure like roads, bridges, trains has speeded up, Uranium purification plants has been setup in the country inspite of the bottlenecks introduced by the Commies and Left to halt such progress by citing ecological damage everytime.\n\nNow it\'s time to skill the able work force through NEP(New Education Policy) and kick out the old Babus from the establishment(You should remember that our own foreign Ambassador insulted our country when the nuclear tests were conducted, who was later given award by the Congress govt.)'<br />Author: 'mech_artist'  id: 'im8nm4'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/im8nm4/how_exports_out_of_bharath_funded_our_own_doom/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Avoid L Boards on your car.'<br />Body: "So, I purchased a car amidst this covid b.s few weeks back. One of the only positives in my life this year :p\n\nBut little did I know, what was written in my destiny. I am a new driver. New but not a noob. I have done the mandatory 10 hours training + Licensing and then spent another 15 hours after obtaining the license to learn and fine tune my driving skills. And it is only then did I go ahead and purchase my car. But, I wanted to still play it safe. So I went ahead and purchased 2 L stickers for the car. Newbie afterall.\n\nWhy am I giving you so much details ?\n\nWell, it is important for what am I about to tell you. \n\nSo, couple of days back, I took the car out for an evening drive around St John's hospital. I was supposed to take this turn towards Koramangala. It was fairly empty that evening but I still looked around before taking the left turn towards Koromangala. I would have proceeded probably 20-30 mtrs from the signal when I see these bike borne loafers trying to overtake me and scream something. My glasses were up so I couldn't hear at first. But after sometime I realised something was up. So I slowed down. By now, they caught up with me and started abusing me in urdu. I politely asked what's the matter but they refused to cool down. And all of this was happening while we were still moving .\n\nSo I decided to stop the car, fearing I might have done something. These bloody cunts get down and accuse me of pushing them off the road near the signal apparately. If that was the case, my car would have had a scratch. But I couldn't find any. But I guess I panicked or whatever and instead of catching their lie, I ended up asking where is the damage. Now, obviously the street wasn't lit that well so I wasn't able to see properly when that loafer pointed towards his old bike deformed stand. Apparately, he had to react fast when I turned and thus ended up busting his  stand. His companion started calling up some guys on the phone. Sounds fake in retrospect, but my mind wasn't working. Newbie came under pressure I guess :p\n\nThings started escalating and it almost came to blows. And based on my previous experience in the city, I know how enthusiastic passerby are to help someone . Instead they will probably jump in to rain some blows on me. Not kidding, I have seen it happen. But anyway, I decided to pacify them and in that moment that other fucker pulled out my wallet and demanded I pay for the damages.\n\nAfter a lot of argument and me denying any fault on my part, I had to shell out 3k for no fault of mine. I should have called the cops but my mind wasn't working. I panicked or whatever and ended up making a pool of myself I guess :p\n\nNever thought it would happen to someone like me who has stayed in this city for more than a decade now. But whatever happened had to happen and I guess it was another learning this year. \n\nSpoke to a friend after that, apparately it's pretty common in other cities as well where they target new car/driver with L board to make them pay for no fault of theirs. If you are a new driver, you would have noticed that auto drivers, cabbies and these puncture wala ( oh yes, he had a puncture shop apparately) will drive extra slow. They would pretend they are halting only for you to try to pass them and that's the moment they'll speed up. And if your reaction time is slow, and you end up touching their bike, which they whole heartedly want to happen, you are in for a ride. \n\nSo beware. Try not to put a L sticker in your car. It serves no purpose. There is no legal benefit from having a L board with DL anyway.\n\nAnother blow to this already pathetic year!\n\nCheers."<br />Author: 'devdibyo'  id: 'iltphi'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iltphi/avoid_l_boards_on_your_car/</li>

Publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by the official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable. It is not advisable to vigorously report crime related issues on a day-to-day basis and comment on the evidence without ascertaining the factual matrix. Such reporting brings undue pressure in the course of fair investigation and trial\n\nThis is [Press council of India](https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/press-council-of-india-advises-media-to-adhere-to-journalistic-norms-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-coverage-11598621487716.html) lastest statement on the conduct of media on Sushant Singh Rajput case. It governs the conduct of the print. However, the News Broadcasting Standards Authority has been silent on the matter so far.\n\nAs our media is looking at the other side and with so much happening around every single day, I reckon it will be good time to compile a list of news outlets which are maintaing the standards of journalism (in my opinion).\n\nThere is no alternative to consume news than reading newspapers.

That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one\'s mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.42, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/522b99qxaxk51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd878d734250057897b73387c1f444bbac439345\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

And on and on it goes.\n\nSo, one wasn’t surprised when the same Congress party recently accused Facebook of favoring the BJP when it’s an open secret that all top social media platforms of importance such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc are populated by leftist woke crowd in the United States who are ideological travellers of the Congress party and have no love lost for the BJP.\n\nEven most of the Indian officials appointed to top positions by these social media platforms have nothing but contempt for the ruling party.\n\nNo less than the Managing Director of Facebook India Ajit Mohan [admitted](https://www.news18.com/news/politics/facebook-representatives-caught-in-bjp-cong-crossfire-at-parl-panel-meet-over-150-queries-unanswered-2843979.html) to a Parliamentary Committee on Wednesday that he not only earlier worked as a consultant with the Kerala Congress but also worked for the UPA-2 government in the Planning Commission and Ministry of Urban Development.\n\nThe International Fact Checking Network Committee head at Facebook, Kanchan Kaur, has been accused by the BJP of using “derogatory language” repeatedly against the BJP as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The same committee approved Alt-News, an Islamo-Leftist propaganda website caught spreading fake and selective information, as a credible member while rejecting Right-wing and centre-right organisations like OpIndia and FactHunt.\n\nProfessor Kaur appeared for a [webcast](https://twitter.com/data_leads/status/1258331382641803269?s=21) discussion with Alt-News founder Pratik Sinha in May, whose hate for Modi needs no introduction. The webcast was officially supported by Google.\n\nNot just that, in 2018, the Congress was [outed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whistleblower-names-congress-as-client-of-cambridge-analytica/articleshow/63491689.cms) as a client of Cambridge Analytica, the disreputed UK-based firm which misused data of millions of Facebook users for election purposes.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, Head of News, Politics and Government for Twitter India was Kashmiri journalist Raheel Khurshid who was often accused of bias against the pro-BJP accounts while freely handing out the coveted ‘blue tick’ to the Leftists. When he was appointed in 2014, many had [pointed](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/outrage-over-appointment-of-new-twitter-india-head/article5558371.ece) out to his old posts alleging his anti-Modi, anti-Hindu and pro-Kashmir separatists stances.\n\nWhen some Twitter users started exposing the political leanings of Mahima Kaul, director of Policy at Twitter India, she deleted her old tweets praising Rahul Gandhi and Congress and showing hateful comments against Modi. “Bombs, quakes, deaths are all second to Narendra Modi’s ambitions. Fuck aam aadmi,” one of her deleted tweets [read](https://www.opindia.com/2018/10/twitter-indias-policy-head-deletes-tweets-after-people-find-out-her-political-bias/).\n\nIt goes without saying that no one lost their plum job at these social media giants for being pro-Congress and anti-Modi. But one instance of a Facebook employee, Aankhi Das' refusal to take down posts and profiles alleged to be problematic by the Congress-Left ecosystem was enough for the Congress top guns to turn apoplectic with rage.\n\nFrom Congress trolls to Rahul Gandhi, all started accusing Facebook of politician interference in India and siding with the BJP. Talk about tolerance. It is perfectly fine as long as Congress and Left-leaning persons are at the helm of affairs in these social media but how dare a platform refuse to oblige Congress‘ order of taking down BJP-leaning posts.\n\nBut that’s the Congress’ tactic. While the BJP is teflon-coated and doesn’t react unless it is repeatedly shaken to the core, Congress goes all in at the slightest transgression against its interest. Even in the opposition, it shows the ruling mindset while the BJP despite being in power keeps displaying the opposition mentality.\n\nBut this time around, it seems even the thick-skinned BJP got irritated by Congress’ tactics of blaming others for doing what it is itself a master at.\n\nUnion Minister for IT Ravi Shankar Prasad wrote a scathing letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg alleging that in the run up to 2019 general elections “there was a concerted effort by Facebook India management to not just delete pages or substantially reduce their reach but also offer no recourse or right of appeal to affected people who are supportive of the right-of-centre ideology“.\n\n”The above documented cases of bias and inaction are seemingly a direct outcome of the dominant political beliefs of individuals in your Facebook India team,” Prasad added.\n\nThe Minister further said that the Facebook India team “is dominated by people who belong to a particular political belief”, an ideology which has been comprehensively defeated at the ballot by the people of India. However, people of this disposition are trying to “discredit India's democratic process by dominating the decision-making apparatus of important social media platforms“, Prasad said.\n\nHe also drew attention of Zuckerberg towards the fact that Facebook employees have been found abusing the Prime Minister and senior Cabinet Ministers of India while working in Facebook India and managing important positions. Moreover, Prasad rightly raised the issue of Facebook outsourcing fact-checking to third party shady fact checkers with no credibility and who are regularly fact-checked by public on social media.\n\nPrasad got to the root of the matter of why the Congress and Left were using ’*ulta chor kotwal ko daante*’ tactics. He said that the ‘entrenched vested interests aren't satisfied with the shrinking space for one side of the spectrum in India and want to throttle it completely. The spate of recent anonymous, source-based reports is nothing but an internal power struggle within your company for an ideological hegemony.” (emphasis ours).\n\nThe perception of pro-BJP bias in Facebook (despite the completely opposite reality) is being created so that the Left can stamp out any neutral or centre-right voices working for the platform.\n\nSadly, Prasad’s letter only stops at listing grievances with no threat to correct course and stop the bias altogether.\n\nThe Minister should’ve told Zuckerberg in no uncertain terms that the Indian government will not allow intervention of foreign platforms in its local politics because that would be “prejudicial to its sovereignty“, an excuse India has used to ban scores of Chines apps.\n\nThe message to Facebook should have been of non-alignment with any ideology, to stay neutral and to not allow any censorship except of posts which fail foul of Indian laws. Zuckerberg would’ve got the message as he read another government order banning 118 Chinese apps."<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'ilqtia'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ilqtia/congresss_bluff_about_hate_speech_and_facebook/</li>

In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind-by steady intelligence directed toward one's pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by higher intelligence.\n\n.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of One's Prescribed Duty in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the summary of this chapter three ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/5th5uvi4svk51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4513e0da38b909e336ebe5f0a751e109bb6f195e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ilom4m'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ilom4m/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is343/</li>

I am not sure if many non Indians would be able to connect to my problem, and where I am coming from. So, I completed my masters in English Literature in 2018, and ever since then, there has been pressure on me to get married from my family. So far, I am fighting against it and trying to crack the NET exam, but having no luck there, partly because of putting up with this perpetual resistance at home with my parents and relatives, and partly because there is a sizable chunk of non english subjects like maths and computer science is also there. \nFor those who don't understand the environment in harayana in a typical harayanavi family regarding girls, they are against me doing any private job, and also against sitting unmarried at home at this age, and leaving no stone unturned in finding less than mediocre guys for me to marry, where also, I won't have much freedom to pursue my dreams or having any choice in many a matters of my life. I want to be financially independent and have a career of my own, this much is clear to me. I do write poetry, and opinions regarding societal issues and do get good reviews about them. At this point, I was thinking to go abroad for  further studies, but I don't know how to convince my parents and, also having no job experience, I am unsure of how I will be able to survive there. If, you have gone through similar experience, or can relate to my situation and have good suggestions, please let me know. Any guidance regarding this will be helpful. And no hate on my family please, as comparing my situation with other girls and women in and around my family, I am still at better position as, they provided me with better education opportunities and treated me good so far. Only, after completing my college education, and refusing the marriage proposals, their behaviour took a turn and I feel isolated, lacking courage to even plan or dream about future, too much focused to avoid any marriage proposals and advices of my family members for me to get married. I got suggestions from my friends to probably go abroad and try to become an English teacher or do hospitality management course, but don't know from where to start and how to convince my parents or get the conviction to act against their wishes if they don't agree."<br />Author: 'comus1996'  id: 'ilmbv1'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ilmbv1/carred_advice_in_a_deep_routed_conservative_family/</li>

How lust can be converted to love of God ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** \'"The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness."  \n"Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead-the highest perfectional stage of human life."\'  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.41, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlqnkwmb6qk51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=262bf53c840ac3c02d4e36675e69237f19fe0492\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita AsIt Is--3.42'<br />Body: "\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\*\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**इन्द्रियाणि पराण्याहुरिन्द्रियेभ्यः परं मनः |**\n\n**मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्यो बुद्धे: परतस्तु सः || ४२ ||**\n\n.\n\n.\n\nindriyāṇi parāṇy āhur\n\nindriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ\n\nmanasas tu parā buddhir\n\nyo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**SYNONYMS**\n\n.\n\nindriyāṇī—senses; parāṇi—superior; āhuḥ—is said; indriyebhyaḥ—more than the senses; param—superior; manaḥ—the mind; manasaḥ—more than the mind; tu—also; parā—superior; buddhiḥ—intelligence; yaḥ—one which; buddheḥ—more than the intelligence; parataḥ—superior; tu—but; saḥ—he.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n.\n\n**The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he \\[the soul\\] is even higher than the intelligence.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act-as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Kaṭha Upaniṣad the soul has been described as mahān, the great. Therefore the soul is above all-namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.\n\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one's mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : How mind and intelligence can work together to control the senses ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/72sob6v8lok51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94501107d6c3a7c044062f74433c9001acd4af22)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'il1vsh'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/il1vsh/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_asit_is342/</li>

In these crimes even poor kids are getting involved for money and getting themselves sabotaged in either drug addiction or in jail.\n2. Alcohol, Cigarette, Tobacco and even Bhaang is legal in India even though all are addictive and harmful for health if consumed in large amount. Then what\'s wrong with legalising other drugs like opiods, Cocaine, Meth, LSD etc. "If we have a choice of choosing what\'s good for us then why not we should be able to choose what might not be good for us."\n3. There are several proven health benefits of using drugs. Opioids like Morphine, Vicodin, Codeine etc. are famous for pain reliefs and are even used as anaesthesia in controlled amount. LSD, MDMA is well known for reducing anxiety and PTSD. And almost every drug provides you calmness.\n4. Illegal trade of drug will stop. In many rural/ semi-urban parts of India small doctors give drugs frequently to people having health problems to calm their pain. Mostly it is given without prescription. This thing will stop and people will be able to take it legally.\n5. Stigma around consuming drugs will go away. I dont see big deal in consuming drugs.

      <li>Title::: 'Free temples and real issues behind this. Hindus themselves are responsible.'<br />Body: 'I am writing this on a video by Faizan Mustafa, I know a lot of people already hate this guy for supporting separatist and jiadis all around the country. But I would urge you guys to watch this video where he explains why temples cannot be freed from govt control and how it is not congress but hindus responsible for this.\n\n[https://youtu.be/1E4eP69TUQs](https://youtu.be/1E4eP69TUQs)\n\nFor those who don\'t know, here is this guy\'s wiki page. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faizan\\_Mustafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faizan_Mustafa)\n\nAnyways some imp info from his video, Today in 2020, there are many laws that prevent freeing of temples all across India. Why did these laws came into existence ? Because hindus have repeatedly complained about mismanagement of temple funds. So state govt sets up a board to take care of management of temple and its funds. The boards set up for management for temples clearly mentions that only hindus can be its members but it is also true that funds of temples are used for "secular" purposes.\n\nFurther courts have this opinion, temples are religious places to worship but any offering or donations made to temples cannot be said to be temple\'s property. It has nothing to do with worship or faith. And thus such offerings or donations whether in money or in kind, shall be taken over by govt and shall be put to secular purposes.\n\nInterestingly one such board was constituted by Mr. Modi himself in 2011 but later removed due to opposition from community in 2013.\n\nNow there are many things on which he gave his opinion but I have only mentioned courts decisions and observation and skipped his rant of how congress is framed for being anti hindu. Some more observations made are, a lot of temples were looted and destroyed by buddhists much before islamic invaders, who built these temples because ownership is to given to community then who should take control of them since they have so much wealth and donations are received every year. This is important because this observation is made by courts and it brings a dead end to this issue.\n\nAnother imp info, I remember S Swamy just a few weeks ago was claiming about a PIL filed in HC against Uttarakhand govt\'s (BJP) move to take temples under the govt control. UK govt has made a new law "Uttarakhand char dham devasthanam management act 2019" which is meant to take over 51 temples of Uttarakhand.

      <li>Title::: 'Contraction in GDP is due to the costs associated with lockdown.'<br />Body: "Yesterday (31 August), the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released India’s Q1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures and the numbers were consistent with what was being expected by many over the last few months — that India’s economy registered a 23.9 per cent contraction in the first quarter when compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe number was consistent with what several investment banks and analysts had forecast.\n\nThe reason why the Q1 figures should not come as a surprise is simple — GDP measures the value of goods and services being produced in a country during a particular period of time.\n\nTherefore, during a lockdown, there is limited production activity taking place. No surprises that when there is limited production, the total value or GDP would be lower.\n\nThis is why the Q1 GDP in FY2020-21 is lower than the one in Q1 for FY 2019-20.\n\nA good example would be to consider how many businesses were shut and registered limited sales during the April and May months due to the lockdown.\n\nIn fact, the lockdown extended even till June. This meant that these firms saw limited sales or production activity, which is why there was no value addition that took place.\n\nLockdowns are a rare occurrence, and it is thus important to put these numbers in perspective before we extend the analysis of the state of the economy.\n\nOne cannot make observations with certitude regarding the state of the economy unless it is open, as there is limited data available during a lockdown.\n\nThis is precisely why even the MOSPI has been careful with data issues it faced while preparing the Q1 figures.\n\nThe joint paper with Dr Arvind Virmani on the pandemic in April 2020 (the paper can be accessed [here](https://egrowfoundation.org/site/assets/files/1314/egrow_wp_no_03_2020_b-2.pdf)) highlighted some of these issues and conceptualised a framework for understanding what is likely to follow.\n\nThe lockdown phase would result in a contraction — and this contraction is not just unique to India but is being experienced across the world.\n\nIn fact, several countries have experienced a sharper contraction than India, despite India having imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns.\n\nThen comes the phase of normalisation of economic activity — which is currently under way. Under this phase, services such as manufacturing, construction *et cetera* experience a steady improvement, while tourism, hospitality and others continue to struggle.\n\nPost-normalisation is when we will witness an economic recovery and one expects this phase to begin from October to November onwards.\n\nThat a granular study of the present Gross Value Added (GVA) numbers show that the agricultural sector grew at 3.4 per cent compared to 3.0 per cent earlier also isn’t a surprise because of several factors.\n\nBut the key takeaway from the data — and this is one that would be expected — is that the contraction was in mining and quarrying (23.3 per cent) and manufacturing (39.3 per cent).\n\nThe worst of the contraction was, however, in construction (-50.3 per cent) and trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting (-47.0 per cent).\n\nAmong these sectors, opening up would immediately result in an improvement in level of economic activity in mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and in trade and transport.\n\nCommunication and services related to broadcasting were, as is, mostly in operation.\n\nThe only place where we would continue to see muted production activity would be some services, and hotels and restaurants.\n\nThe Q1 figures have revealed the costs associated with lockdown — and while the lockdown was essential for preparing our physical infrastructure and getting in place a mechanism for dealing with the pandemic, the gain from lockdowns have been significantly lower than the costs associated with them.\n\nThis is precisely why the Central government has gradually started to open up the economy as it aims to save both lives and livelihoods.\n\nWe can debate whether the prolonged lockdowns were of any use, and whether the economy needs a greater demand stimulus to assist the recovery process — but what is more essential at the moment is to resist the temptation by states to continue with lockdowns.\n\nJust as the Central government starts the process of unlocking, states need to get rid of localised lockdowns.\n\nAllowing the economy to function and supply chains to repair will be critical, going forward. It's time for the lockdown to end and people to get back to work."<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'iki0cy'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/iki0cy/contraction_in_gdp_is_due_to_the_costs_associated/</li>

Jñānam refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. Vijñānam refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of one\'s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me yad-vijñāna-samanvitam / sarahasyaṁ tad-aṅgaṁ ca gṛhāna gaditaṁ mayā: "The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, being veiled by māyā, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself." Bhagavad-gītā gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thereby one may become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious and act accordingly.\n\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead-the highest perfectional stage of human life.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between Jñānam and Vijñānam ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is Kṛṣṇa consciousness ? How lust can be converted to love of God ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhmb155vqgk51.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4f509dcf7ad19bf7d73bfb0208018ff803b568\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ikdp3s'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ikdp3s/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is341/</li>

The Sikhs defended the small fort for eight months under conditions of great hardship, but on 7 December 1715 the Mughals broke into the starving garrison and captured Banda Singh and his companions. Banda Singh Bahadur was put into an iron cage and the remaining Sikhs were chained. The Sikhs were brought to Delhi in a procession with the 780 Sikh prisoners, 2,000 Sikh heads hung on spears, and 700 cartloads of heads of slaughtered Sikhs used to terrorise the population. They were put in the Delhi fort and asked to give up their faith and become Muslims. But none of the Bandai Khalsas gave up their religion. On their firm refusal these non-converters were ordered to be executed. Every day 100 Sikh soldiers were brought out of the fort and murdered in public. This continued for approximately seven days. After three months of confinement, on 9 June 1716, Banda Singh had been dismounted and seated on the ground, he was offered the usual choice between Islam and death. His young son Ajay Singh, about four years, was placed in his arms and he was told to take the boy’s life. He refused. Then the executioner hacked the boy to pieces joint by joint with a long knife, dragged out his quivering heart and thrust it into the mouth of his father. Then Banda Singh\'s eyes were gouged out, his limbs were severed, his skin removed, and then he was killed.  \n\n\nRabindra Nath Tagore had this to say about this incident in his poem "Bandi Bir"\n\n    In mere teen was the boy,\n    With hands tied thrown as a toy\n    Into the lap of Banda and without a word\n    He drew him close to his heart.\n    For a while he put his hand on his head,\n    Just once kissed his turban red.\n    He then draws his dagger,\n    Whispers in the child’s ear –\n    “Wahe Guru- fear not my son”\n    A virile in the boy’s face did burn –\n    In his juvenile voice the court did ring\n    “Wahe Guru” as he did sing.\n    With his left hand Banda held the boy,\n    With right struck the dagger in his ploy,\n    “Wahe Guru”, was all he did implore\n    As he took to the floor.'<br />Author: 'abi_hawkeye'  id: 'ik79dt'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ik79dt/little_story_of_execution_of_banda_singh_bahadur/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Should JEE and NEET be postponed or cancelled for this academic year? [Posted this on Quora and got myself flagged as propaganda although it was totally my own opinion,what do you guys think?(FYI I'm a 2021 NEET aspirant too)]"<br />Body: " \n\nQ. Should JEE and NEET be postponed or cancelled for this academic year?\n\nA big bold **NO** from my side! You see I’m not going to twaddle upon the pros and cons because they’re going to have difference in their significance for everybody as per the conditions they’re in during this crisis so let’s just dwell straight into the points I’m trying to convey.\n\n1. Both logically and legally,examinations are not a fundamental right,they’re a choice, so either you’re deprived of them or given the privilege to sit-in, either way you can’t sue anyone or blame the government,so legally if you do get infected,it’s because of your own choice to go out and write the examinations while exposing yourself to the risk at the same time. (Exactly the same way how I can’t blame the government if I die in a car-crash on my way to my NEET centre,that’s both,illegal and stupid)\n2. Your choice of not attending the examinations doesn’t trump the choice and demand of others who want to write it even during the time of crisis,so if I want to give the exam and you don’t, both of us have equal privilege to do so as per our choice,your choice shouldn’t force me to abandon mine,so get a grip! If you are so fearful of your life (or in reality the exam I should say) then don’t sit for it in the first place,whether the exam happens or not you folks are always going to have a choice to skip it whereas asking for the exams to be postponed is going to be the ultimate example of majoritarian/authoritarian imposition on those who want the exams to happen. (For the opposition that’s trying so hard,what you guys are trying to achieve,that’s the actual murder of democracy imposing majoritarian will of not giving the exams on the minority of dedicated students)\n3. Democracy isn’t about doing what the majority wants,it’s about finding a common ground with every citizen whether you agree with them or not,these mass protests and tweeting in opposition to the exams happening is the best form of example you’re ever going to see about how gullible teenagers can be, and how if we really leave the country to emotionally-loaded,hormonally influenced,inexperienced kids,the country’s for sure going to collapse.(Not anything against teenagers but because it's true,we do commit a lot more mistakes,are emotionally loaded and way more irresponsible than adults in general, maybe because we haven't had the taste of real world much)\n4. So even if I happen to be the only person in the country who wants to appear for an exam,I should be allowed to because the risk it involves,the consequences and every single circumstances,it’s all my choice, and if the rest 2 million -1 people don’t want to and hence skip the exam,it’s their choice and I respect it. (A similar example being how in communist affected areas elections are still organised even if there’s only a voter or two in the whole region,again,being less in number shouldn’t undermine someone’s voice. Just because 2 million people have a voice louder than mine doesn’t render their argument logical and my opinion redundant.\n5. I’m sure what we’ve seen in the last few months,the whole exam fiasco, while it’s given some students whose ranks are going to be greater than their phone numbers relaxing vibes,it’s given the serious ones only tension and chills. My advice? Be a serious student, concentrate on your preparations,if you’re done then keep revising,watching the news won’t change what’s happening and tweeting won’t change the decision that’s already been taken,have some trust in your government,it’s not anti-student as they say it is,they’ve done more for you than any other government we’ve ever had, have faith in god and do your best irrespective of when the exams happen, next year or now!\n6. And at last please explain to me since when did humanity stop building flyovers and speedways because of the fear of road accidents!\n\n*Jai Hind!*"<br />Author: 'Ilovephysics123'  id: 'ijsuag'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ijsuag/should_jee_and_neet_be_postponed_or_cancelled_for/</li>

Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:  \nyasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇāpe tri-dhātuke  \nsva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma idyadhīḥ  \nyat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salite na karhicij  \njaneṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva gokharaḥ.  \n"A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be considered as an ass or a cow."  \n**Question 1 : How lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](3vaxx4oqg9k51 "Chapter 3: Karma-yoga\n")\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ijr1i3'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ijr1i3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is340/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How can we stop Love Jihad?'<br />Body: "The core issue is this: rights of women marrying under the Hindu Marriage Act or the Special Marriage Act (SMA) vary greatly from those who wed as per Sharia or the Muslim Personal Law.\n\nTo marry Muslim men, non-Muslim women have to convert first — this is the condition for marriage under Sharia. It means that any non-Muslim woman marrying a Muslim man instantly losses all her rights as she enters from a more-rights legal regime to one with few rights.\n\nThe right solution thus is to ban inter-religious marriages under Sharia. Any person or institution (Maulvis, mosques, etc) who facilitates such marriage should be given exemplary punishment.\n\nIf a Muslim man and non–Muslim woman must marry, the same must be registered only under the Special Marriage Act in a civil court. Yogi Sarkar will have to work with Modi Sarkar on this front because only the Parliament can amend the SMA.\n\nWhat would this achieve?\n\nFirst, the women won't lose their rights and they will be a more equal partner (at least legally) as compared to their condition under the Sharia.\n\nSecond, minor girls (below the age of 18 years) will be under solid legal protection from exploitation. Every now and then, we come across cases where minor girls are converted first and then married under Sharia (legal age of marriage under Muslim personal law is 16). This will stop.\n\nAnyone who indulges in entrapping minors to marry them can be prosecuted for rape or tried under acts like The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.\n\nThird, a woman is not automatically converted if she marries a Muslim under the SMA. This would enable the women to continue to follow their religion if they feel strongly about it. Currently, they get converted first de jure but retain their religion de facto because their Muslim husbands promise them they can continue to practice their religion but then later renege due to family or community pressure.\n\nBut this is not enough. A new provision should be added under SMA for inter-religious marriages where the husband or his family can be prosecuted if they subject the woman to harassment or put pressure on her to convert.\n\nFourth, since a marriage under the SMA is allowed only if neither the man nor the woman have living spouses, it will put a leash on polygamy to an extent.\n\nFifth, because these marriages will take place under the SMA in India's official court system rather than be solemnised by a maulvi in a mosque, it will result in proper documentation.\n\nWe will have actual information from a database which can shed better light on the inter-faith marriages occurring in the country. It can provide us some good insights — most importantly — like if there is an asymmetry (and how much) in the kind of inter-religious marriages that have occurred.\n\nOnce basic protection is secured for non-Muslim women, the State’s role ends. All this may not still stop ’Love Jihad’ but it will put an end to abuse and harassment of women to a great extent.\n\nThe main responsibility for raising children lies with the family and if parents don’t want their children to marry people of certain ideologies they consider harmful, then they must channelise their energies on raising sons and daughters that way. Right family upbringing rooted in one’s culture and values is the only sure shot vaccine.\n\nIf the BJP governments in states as well as at the centre are serious about the issue, they must think of concrete ways that address the root cause of the problem rather than simply responding to symptoms."<br />Author: 'Kafir-Lives-Matter'  id: 'ijpuxe'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ijpuxe/how_can_we_stop_love_jihad/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why socialism is not good for India, as of today?'<br />Body: 'Firstly, by socialism in the post header, I mean that the means of production being owned by the society as a whole.\n\nThe socialism relating distribution of food, higher direct taxes, state involvement in education and healthcare and reservation, reasonably strong regulations on corporates is what we should support.\n\nThe reason for distinction between the above two types of socialism is necessary. The one that we should support aims at providing basic necessities to the underprivileged.\n\nWe are a nation of poor and highly underprivileged people. Till the time these basic necessities aren\'t fulfilled, it will be difficult for us to build our human resource capacity to its optimum levels. Thus, the socialism pertaining to providing basic necessities to the underprivileged must be supported.\n\nNow coming to the socialism wherein the means of production are held by the society as a whole (eg. Co-operative society). If we go down this path, it would mean heavy dependence on State, it\'s resources and criteria to be a member of that "co-operative society". \n\nBecause in a society as fragmented like ours, this form of socialism will not be beneficial to the underprivileged, but only to the one\'s who see each other as "equal", which isn\'t the case in India as of today. It would mean that they\'ll be over dependent on the leaders of co-op society with muscle power or the political party, in order to get their fair share.\n\nSame is the case with socialism wherein the means of production are owned by the state. Too much dependence of the underprivileged on the state is not the right way to bring them out of the misery, because they\'ll keep demanding from the state, and the state with its own bureaucratic issue will be unable to hear them. Also, in case of State owned enterprises the biggest drawback is the lack of innovation, amongst other things.\n\nSo what is the better way? To provide lands and corporate benefits to businesses to setup industries. Though this too comes with problems relating to land acquisition dependency on Government, but that can be taken care of by way of Government owned enterprises like UPSIDA, SIDCUL, MIDC, Silvassa model etc as it has happened successfully previously.\n\nTo uplift the underprivileged in India, the better way is to provide them with basic resources and with opportunity (other than farming) in their vicinity. To provide them with education and give the equal opportunity to innovate. That can happen in organic manner, only when there\'s no dependency on the state.\n\nThe answer to the rural problems in India is rapid industrialization. One of the good ways to decrease the caste issue is rapid urbanization; that can happen by way of decrease in dependence on agriculture as source of livelihood.'<br />Author: 'harharmahadevshiv'  id: 'ijmiez'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ijmiez/why_socialism_is_not_good_for_india_as_of_today/</li>

How govt is doing an unjustice and being completely wrong.'<br />Body: 'I think it\'s been rough for the JEE and NEET aspirants who were hoping for the postponement of the exams. From the day SC\'s dismissed the PIL till now, there were different efforts and protests against this decision. It\'s clear that there is still, genuinely students who are/will suffer and afraid but, according to the Govt and the SC it is what it is and life has to move on. \n\nWe all know how SOP\'s, govt policies, safety rules gets implemented on the ground. Rules and regulations only seem good in paper. Shouldn\'t the govt prepare more, be more cautious? If 8% of the students get infected there will be  80000 of them but, who cares we are getting 75000 cases a day and why would the students who will not get infected should suffer. Exams must go on, right?\n\nNo! It\'s not!\nI think it\'s because of this, that India is still the most affected country around the globe 🌎 during this pandemic. "Dekha jayega, chalta hai" is that thinking, that caused many to suffer and die in the past and in the present. We have to understand it\'s not fine, it never was and it never will be. If you are not affected that doesn\'t mean everyone/everything is fine. Especially, thanks to the media these days, the real picture is way too blurry and out of touch with reality. "Jo bikta hai bas, vahi dikhta hai". This sense of reality is way too much dangerous, right now someone else is suffering and tomorrow we might too.\n\n\n\nEquality of opportunity is a must but unfortunately, it\'s just on the papers. You simply cannot compare a student of a stable family living in city with a student living in poor, backward vilages/places where they can\'t even get the electricity forget about the internet. Now think about this in a pandemic, the gap between the two becomes way too big. \n\nWhether it\'s the ruling Govt or the opposition they both are just playing with students emotions. One is cashing in on the opportunity to bash the decision and the other one is just trying to disprove. It was all a show, both had the power but, no of them acted. \n\nBigger problems demand bigger solutions and there were some but, nonetheless they were ignored. \n\nI also have some what lost faith in Supreme Court. They definitely to some extent are influenced. It\'s just sad and disheartening to be honest. \n\nIn the end I would just like to wish all of the students out there the best. I know it\'s sucks but still. \n\nI, as a fellow aspirant pray none of us get affected or infected in any way possible. And yeah, Modi sahab be ready for 2024. \n\n\nJai hind.
