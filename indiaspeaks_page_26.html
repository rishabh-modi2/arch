      <li>Title::: 'The concept that Bollywood is somehow "Hinduphobic" is Absurd. You all are cherrypicking to the point of delusion... As a minority, trust me I learned more about Hinduism than my own religion growing up. In Pakistan Kids Do Aarti after watching Bollywood, Indian Kids Don\'t learn Namaz from Bollywood'<br />Body: 'You guys have cherrypicked out of 1000s of movies to suit your agenda, for every villain portrayed as hindu there will be 10 hindus portrayed as heroes and doing puja taking mom to temple etc. Whether its the movie Baghban or Main Hoon Na or Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And way too many movies have muslims as villains like Gangs of Wasseypur or "A Wednesday".  This is why a lot of people think the right wing is delusional and crazy, don\'t let emotion and cherrypicked stats get in the way. Of course there are some instances worth criticizing like Shivji in PK, but a certain religion\'s prophet would never be depicted that way, but on the whole don\'t be ridiculous. The amount of times girl does aarti some miracle happens is insane. The amount of times the good guy is the one doing puja is so high its insane. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of focusing on conspiracies focus on actual stuff thats happening such as demographic change. Not a pip from the main stream media about this. If you guys made as much noise about demographic change as you do about nonsense conspiracies like this or Love Jihad (most of which is due to Muslim girls being in burkha and not going to college/outside house), at least some action would have been taken.'<br />Author: 'teresenahopaaega'  id: 'k18zp4'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k18zp4/the_concept_that_bollywood_is_somehow_hinduphobic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Mumbai 26/11 from the eye of a Mumbaikar'<br />Body: "I still remember that day the terrorists targeted my city. It was year 2008. I was studying in school.\n\nAs soon as we came to know, we started dialling everyone. Giving updates about possible locations to avoid the terrorists. These enemy of humanity had first targetted local trains during peak hours. Local trains as many might know, are among the most important way of travel for Mumbaikars.\n\nWe were stuck to watching news. I believe the whole thing lasted four days. The city part lasted one or two days but next two-three days was the Taj Hotel. While the terrorists were still inside the Taj Hotel, we in the city felt slightly relived, yet unsafe, as there were talks that other terrorists might be around somewhere, maybe there might be another strike, who knows there was so uncertainty. While we still felt for the people inside the hotel.\n\nIn those time there was one person who kept our moral up. A person who had started a new English news channel not so long ago. That channel was TimesNow and that person was none other than Arnab Goswami.\n\nArnab's persistent aggression against the terrorists. That we Indians will not back down, we Indians will not take it anymore, we Indians will not accept this, was something which gave rise to a nationalist in me. But more than that, it made us understand that we will not take this lightly.\n\nArnab was probably the only channel which was covering this up 24 hours for the three days it lasted (no one locked him up then for doing that). This while other news channels switched to reporting something else overall.\n\nOn TimesNow, the lady correspondent reporting this on ground kept saying: we are reporting from afar and not reporting latest details to not reveal information to terrorists who might be watching. Which came as a welcome move, but surprise that she and Arnab were repeating this so much. It was only later did we come to know that Bukha Begum was reporting all the secret details on national television and Hafiz Saeed was watching it from Pakistan and later reporting that to the terrorists here. Arnab in that aspect did a great job, of both covering and yet not revealing information.\n\nAlong with Arnab Goswami, what took our morale further was the great poem by Prasoon Joshi, named [Iss Bar Nahi](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WkkpKJZYqkY). This peom by Prasoon Joshi inspired me to write the poem which I had written after Pulwama.\n\nSeeing all this, it makes me understand why Congress and left hates Arnab Goswami so much. Because is exactly opposite of what they stands for.\n\nWhen we had to give it back to Pakistan, Congress was busy finding evidence. When we needed surgical strikes, Congress was busy providing biryani worth lakhs, if not crores to Kasab. When we needed to call out jihadi terrorists worldwide, Congress was busy blaming Hindus for 26/11, saying it was an Hindu RSS conspiracy. Yet Congress got elected next year, you know why? Because there was no WhatsApp and Twitter back then, exposing them for their misdeeds.\n\nLet's also not forget our brave police officer who got martyred while catching Kasab alive, otherwise Congress had already decided that all the blame should go to Hindus and RSS. I call that brave police officer *Sant* Tukaram Ombale. The original sant Tukaram taught us bhakti, this Sant Tukaram Ombale taught us desh bhakti, rajya bhakti and karma bhakti. He is no less saint for me.\n\nNot to forget all the others in the force who martyred while fighting terrorists and even the common public that we lost.\n\nAs the hotel thing went on, I remember, on second or third day, the commandos came. It was later that I came to know that Congress government was also behind the possible delay of coming of the commandos.\n\nWhen the commandos were entering the hotel, they were boosted with loud shouts of Bharat Mata Ki Jai from everyone outside. I can never forget that scene. It still gives me goose bumps remembering it. That's when we knew that the terrorists inside the hotel are going to have it from us.\n\nThey were highly professional in their conduct too. Switching the lights on/of everytime they completed covering a certain area. After days of fighting, shooting, bombing of hotel's dome and more fighting, the terrorists were finally neutralized and this finally got over.\n\nIt still pains me as a Mumbaikar that Hafeez Saeed and Zakir Ur Rahman Lakhvi are possibly roaming free and yet we cannot do anything. Possibly because the correct action wasn't taken on the correct time.\n\nForget about action against them, from my understanding, Congress government at center, it's home ministry back then took way too long to decide on Kasab's punishment - it requires home minister's permission and order, which they gave just months or a year before 2014 elections to get some votes out if it.\n\nAnyway, this terror strike changed Mumbai forever. Everytime we go anywhere in Mumbai, whether bus train or in other public spaces, we get worried, what if terror strikes our city again. Atleast this time we have better experience and are better equipped, not only in police, but also in our navy, air force and the army too."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'k18a4i'<br />Score:139<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k18a4i/mumbai_2611_from_the_eye_of_a_mumbaikar/</li>

How he can get out of it ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind\'s ego which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.

The chargesheet states that about 300 Bengali-speaking women were used in the Delhi violence.\n\n&gt;Not only this, these women were called from the Jahangirpuri area of Delhi to the Zafarabad Anti-CAA Protest Site. These women were brought to Jaffarabad in 7 buses. According to the charge sheet, on 23 February, they were first taken in buses to the demonstration site of Shaheen Bagh, where these women were fed and then after that they were brought to the Jaffarabad demonstration site. The chargesheet states that most of these women were in burqas and were also involved in stone pelting during the protest.\n\n&gt;The Bengali-speaking women were also paid the bus fare.

The water less concept is making a strong comeback simply because in the past 3-4 decades there has been tremendous use of water in skin care products to make them economical ‚Äì cost effective and of course non-greasy. Light texture, water/gel based, non-greasy (no chip chip) has been the promoted favoured trend in the last few decades. \xa0  \nWater has been used as filler only because it‚Äôs inexpensive. The increased water usage reduced the overall effectiveness of the product. The more the water, less effective is the product creating a constant urge to reapply.  \nHence waterless products are potent, efficient and last long with better shelf life of its own.  \nOne of the simple examples of water based waterless skin care products is Body Lotion. Lotion is a mix of water &amp; oil which calls for the addition of an emulsifier to blend water &amp; oil as the two do not blend with each other on its own. Additional ingredients like colour, fragrance/perfume, and thickener are added to enhance the colour, texture &amp; aroma in the product. \xa0  \nAfter shower Body oil is the Waterless skin care product to use in place of body lotion. The companies suggest applying the oil on the body immediately after the shower, on moist skin to lock the moisture and stay day long moisturised with no urge to look for a bottle of lotion multiple times a day. \xa0  \nBoth water based &amp; water less are used for the same purpose but applying water based products means application of chemicals &amp; preservatives as well.  \nSo in a way the waterless skin care is economical, healthy &amp; environment friendly.  \n‚úÖEconomical ‚Äì A bottle of body oil lasts much longer than a bottle of body lotion as only a few drops help moisturise the body. Don‚Äôt have to pay for the water which is free flowing from the tap and is the major ingredient in the bottle of a lotion.  \n‚úÖHealthy ‚Äì No water means no addition of emulsifier and preservatives.  \n‚úÖEnvironment Friendly ‚Äì The usage of no chemicals and preservatives help keep the environment healthy. \xa0 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsadikpblc161.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d2d8385f680d8b2a2eb465417c35f4c78e700df'<br />Author: 'snaana_'  id: 'k0ogah'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k0ogah/waterless_beauty_skincare_effective_healthy/</li>

And the period is not reliable. Hence their insistence on cash payments. \n\nSimilarly, upon talking to a restaurant owner, found out that he stopped partnering with aggregators due to their practices. They get pay-outs after a certain time period, and control is with the company. Also, even when customers pay cash the company deducts the transaction fees. And if there's a dispute they'd deduct the amount and we all know how many times people misuse the services. \n\nI had read that another business ordered water bottles, lied to customer care, and amount were deducted. \n\nSometimes you can make a difference with how you pay, how you order and where you order. \n\nRemember, most of the times you're increasing ROI rather than providing a livelihood. \n\nSo just be aware of what happens in the industries and try to benefit people who are there to earn a living rather than giving a higher return to a large VC."<br />Author: 'shermitt'  id: 'k064s6'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k064s6/if_you_want_to_help_the_people_in_your_community/</li>

To my surprise there was an extra charge nestled in there called "Packing Charges" which was unexpected as I expect these sort of charges to show up where the delivery charges show up, I hope there is a reasonable explanation for that because you kind of have to tap the taxes heading to see the breakdown when ordering.\n\nI am aware restaurants charge the packing fees not swiggy and I can get behind that for example I often order from BK near me and often order a shake, the shake comes in it own sturdy cup with an adult size sippy cap. The burger comes in it\'s own wrapping and box with a whole of marketing going on it. It is similar for most "branded" eateries like Burger Singh, Dominos, Nandos, Moti Mahal and more when they charge for packing it comes with something that seems worth paying for, it would be awesome it the cost was lower but at least there is some reason behind the cost.\n\nI understand this sort of packaging costing me Rs. 30-50 even though the restaurants cost for these things is probably significantly lower. What I cannot digest is a restaurant sending me 3 cheap polybags, the ones you get from local sabzi mandi and charging Rs. 57 for them as "packing charges".\n\nBy the way BK doesn\'t send any polybags, almost exclusively paper bags.\n\nI have sadly noticed this as a trend almost exclusively among most local restaurant , most branded places charge for packing and do provide packing that makes sense to pay for.\n\nOff topic for a bit here but this is the reason I do not believe in Vocal for Local or supporting the local businesses form evil corporation, not in India. Most of our local business are predatory as well, given the opportunity they use even worse tactics. I cannot be vocal for local if the local is only bothered with making more money and not interested in the customers welfare or even improving the quality when the revenue goes up.\n\nI couldn\'t believe that I was charged Rs. 57 for freaking polythene.

      <li>Title::: 'Waterless Beauty'<br />Body: " \n\nWaterless beauty is not new to Indians, those who did not westernise with the wave always used ancient- ayurvedic ways to wash and nourish the skin.  Different herb /clay Powders, oils &amp; butters and water in their respective state have always made up as super effective known beauty ingredients.\n\nWith various industrial revolutions the past couple of decades, many ingredients especially chemicals &amp; preservatives have made their way to skin care &amp; beauty products with the mere motive to make them cost effective &amp; non-greasy. The focus in recent years has majorly shifted to fancy packaging, advertisements with tall claims, misleading terms like pure, natural, organic etc. simply to lure the customer.   \n\nWaterless beauty &amp; skin care products come back is about returning to healthy, chemical &amp; preservative free products. Over the years be it food or skin care, the growing side effects of the synthetics- chemicals and preservatives have forced mankind to think on the return journey.\n\nHence waterless beauty is the said new era to dawn upon for generations who did not witness their parents/grandparents using oil in place of lotion. \n\n**What is water less beauty or skin care product?**\n\nWater less beauty or water less [skin care](https://www.snaana.com/) products simply means the product does not contain water at all. The water less concept is making a strong comeback simply because in the past 3-4 decades there has been tremendous use of water in skin care products to make them economical ‚Äì cost effective and of course non-greasy. Light texture, water/gel based, non-greasy (no chip chip) has been the promoted favoured trend in the last few decades.   \n\nWater has been used as filler only because it‚Äôs inexpensive. The increased water usage reduced the overall effectiveness of the product. The more the water, less effective is the product creating a constant urge to reapply.\n\nHence waterless products are potent, efficient and last long with better shelf life of its own.\n\nOne of the simple examples of water based waterless skin care products is Body Lotion. Lotion is a mix of water &amp; oil which calls for the addition of an emulsifier to blend water &amp; oil as the two do not blend with each other on its own. Additional ingredients like colour, fragrance/perfume, and thickener are added to enhance the colour, texture &amp; aroma in the product.  \n\nAfter shower Body oil is the Waterless skin care product to use in place of body lotion. The companies suggest applying the oil on the body immediately after the shower, on moist skin to lock the moisture and stay day long moisturised with no urge to look for a bottle of lotion multiple times a day.  \n\nBoth water based &amp; water less are used for the same purpose but applying water based products means application of chemicals &amp; preservatives as well.\n\nSo in a way the waterless skin care is economical, healthy &amp; environment friendly.\n\n**Economical ‚Äì** A bottle of body oil lasts much longer than a bottle of body lotion as only a few drops help moisturise the body. Don‚Äôt have to pay for the water which is free flowing from the tap and is the major ingredient in the bottle of a lotion.\n\n**Healthy ‚Äì** No water means no addition of emulsifier and preservatives.\n\n**Environment Friendly ‚Äì** The usage of no chemicals and preservatives help keep the environment healthy.   \n\nIn earlier times, [mustard oil](https://www.snaana.com/organic-mustard-oil), [sesame oil](https://www.snaana.com/pure-sesame-oil), [coconut oil](https://www.snaana.com/pure-coconut-oil), desi ghee was used as skin moisturiser after the shower to keep the skin nourished- free from dryness and itch.\n\nThe rich royal community used aromatic plant oils like rose oil mixed with carrier oils to beautify the skin in ancient times.\n\n**Are water based products bad for skin?**\n\nWater as an ingredient is beneficial for the skin as it helps in quick and easy absorption of oils in the skin pores. Water being light &amp; non ‚Äì greasy, ph balancing helps sink better in skin pores providing skin its needed hydration and long last relief from dryness/itch. Therefore, water is used with oils/butters to reap maximum benefit to the skin.   \n\nBut water when added as an ingredient to the product like face cream, body lotion, face serum certainly needs chemicals &amp; preservatives to give it a texture, consistency and shelf life.\n\nThese chemicals &amp; preservatives may unknowingly and invisibly do more harm to the body than the good we expect from the product.  Many brands claim to use less than 1% food preservatives in their formulation to prevent products from going bad calling the product completely safe. Think if less than 1% preservative can save the 99% of the product from damage, isn‚Äôt the used food preservative strong enough to make an impact on our bodies?\n\nAnd hence the water in the product as an ingredient is bad.\n\n**Is waterless beauty a new concept?**\n\nWashing the skin with different herb powders, using oil/ghee to moisturise the skin, using beeswax to set the hair are some of the traditional day to day skin beauty &amp; care routines that were practiced in different Indian homes for times unknown. The chemicals &amp; preservatives used in today's formulation in different organic and ayurvedic products were not known in ancient times ‚Äì with no mention in ayurveda.\n\nThe products were used in their own natural state with least processing.\n\nWe are going back to the same concept of retaining the original natural physical &amp; solubility state of the product with zero alteration.  \n\n**Is water less beauty a step towards sustainability?**\n\nWaterless beauty definitely is a positive step towards sustainability but connecting it with only water scarcity is hype, a trend mostly seen as a marketing tool.\n\nGoing waterless in product formulation is a tiny percentage of water saved as compared to water wasted in manufacturing, packaging &amp; shipping of the product.  Water used in producing chemicals &amp; preservatives, used in bath/showers, toilets, kitchen etc are by far the most wasted ‚Äì create unthinkable water footprints.\n\nBut, going waterless has multiple health &amp; sustainability benefits too.\n\n* No water ‚Äì means no chemicals &amp; preservative needed in the product.\n*    Healthy product\n* A potent and effective product\n* Product is environment friendly\n*    Economical in the long run- last longer than conventional products as only few drops/pea size is needed at a time\n\n**Is Waterless and clean beauty the same thing?**\n\nWaterless &amp; clean beauty may not be the same completely.\n\nClean beauty means that the product is safe, free from toxic ingredients, all ingredients are labelled etc. However the term is not regulated by any law. It is the term that has evolved over the years looking at the need of the market. Clean beauty may contain water and chemicals &amp; preservatives, thought to be safe for humans.\n\nSNAANA with 100% chemical &amp; preservative free ‚Äì waterless beauty product line since 2017 is a game changer in altering the dynamics of the skin care industry.\n\nThe need and the desire of the founder to go completely natural in formulation of the skin care beauty products led to clean ‚Äì effective and environment friendly product composition, something which came out to be new to the consumers in terms of texture, consistency, colour and aroma.\n\nThe thumb rule of the formulation is not to alter the state and solubility of the ingredient. For example A lotion formulation calls for the addition of water and oils. Since the two do not mix on its own with each other ‚Äì a solubilizer is needed to facilitate blending water and oil. Anything that contains water and is in liquid state certainly needs preservative to enhance the shelf life.\n\nIt's only the undiluted hydrosols/ steam distilled water/ark in water state that stays without preservatives for more than a year if stored in proper conditions. Know more on the traditional technique of making hydrosols and their multiple benefits.\n\nHence to keep the products clean ‚Äì chemical and preservative free ‚Äì it is important to retain their natural property.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs when the brand started making a conscious effort in educating the customer in choosing the right chemical free healthy product. In the course, [SNAANA](https://www.snaana.com/)found that consumers, a lay man if often lured by fancy attractive green &amp; organic labels and choose their skin care product not by ingredients or solely by benefits but their buy majorly depends on the product fragrance and preferably a non- greasy texture.\n\nConscious and health savvy consumers are the torch bearers in appreciating and promoting the brand SNAANA for its clean work in the skin, health &amp; wellness industry.\n\nProducts at SNAANA are prepared the traditional way and hence there is a close association with farmers cultivating herbs and cash crops to produce pure raw material to ensure a quality and effective product.\n\nSNAANA online store is a unique shop for skin, health and wellness products to cater and suit almost all your needs.\n\n**Return to yourself to a healthy ‚Äì beautiful you with SNAANA**"<br />Author: 'snaana_'  id: 'jzyaxo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jzyaxo/waterless_beauty/</li>

The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nThe word ƒÅtmƒÅ denotes body, mind and soul-depending upon different circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, ƒÅtmƒÅ refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind\'s ego which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this. It is also said:\n\n.\n\nmana eva manu·π£yƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πÅ kƒÅra·πáa·πÅ bandha-mok·π£ayo·∏•bandhƒÅya vi·π£ayƒÅsa·πÖgo muktyai nirvi·π£aya·πÅ mana·∏•.\n\n.\n\n"For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation." Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : Why the pure soul is entangled in the material world ?

The discrimination and prejudice among folks from these places was at a different level altogether.\n\nIn Delhi, the culture is such that you make fun of everything you can..your physical attributes, your accent, your economic status etc..bullying is ingrained into Haryanvi and Punjabi culture, which have a strong influence over Delhi‚Äôs culture. While it isn‚Äôt healthy and in general should stop, I‚Äôve never seen discrimination against someone from other parts of India. For someone from other states, the bullying culture might be a shock, but it‚Äôll take them a couple of years to realize that were being bullied just because they were from South or North East!\n\nBut what I discovered when I met Maharashtrians and Tamil folks, it was blatant hate against certain regions. Sitting in the US (desperately waiting for greeen cards), my Marathi friends justified Raj Thakre beating up Bhirari and UPite street hawkers, because they said only if I understand the pain that these immigrants bring and how they take away jobs (see the irony?)\n\nMy Tamil friends accused North Indians of not worshiping lord Kartikeyn while praying his brother lord Ganesha because the former was born in South India. There were many such self-created theories that have no foundation whatsoever. Then they are like, you call all South Indians Madrasis..while they call all Americans the Tamil equivalent of ‚ÄúAngrez‚Äù. A large part of southern India was the state of Madras and people who haven‚Äôt travelled or read up, might generalise based on what is the common outdated narrative. But why is that such a big deal? Because Kannadigas hate Tamil etc..they hate being categorised similarly. \n\nWe just need to become a little more tolerant and take more pride in the diversity of our country, or the politicians and now, social media propagandists are going to easily break us apart and we‚Äôll never progress.\n\nPS: I know there‚Äôs a lot of irony in my post where I am calling out stereotypes while stereotyping some communities myself, but I couldn‚Äôt figure a better way to communicate this..hope you get the point though!'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'jzdkzd'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jzdkzd/the_stereotyping_we_must_stop_in_india/</li>

I am not sure if that will.\n\nI was asking to get a heater to heat a room, or think about any cheap options to heat the room. BTW, our home doesn\'t get sunlight even in 1 room. So, you can imagine how cold it is.(Weird home, too too hot in winter, too fucking cold in winter LOL) .\n\nBUt then they were like, "omg...".."how can we afford"..."omg, why so many demands"..."omg...". The sister is crazily good at deflecting my demands . I asked for alternative-"OF course, she was just a real life troller...she couldn\'t tell me of any alternatives\'.\n\nPlus the big bullshit.

He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yogƒ´s who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K·πõ·π£·πáa.

This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts, namely j√±ƒÅna-yoga, dhyƒÅna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is called the yogƒÅruruk·π£a stage, and the highest rung is called yogƒÅr≈´·∏çha.\n\n.\n\nConcerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\n\n.\n\nA K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa. And, being constantly engaged in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is considered to have ceased all material activities.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the highest stage of the Yoga-ladder ?

      <li>Title::: 'Would the Mauryan Empire would be best suited to unify India and protect if from foreign invaders (Ex: Europeans colonizers), and modernize/industrialize the economy so India can compete with other countries in the global economy? If not can you think of an Empire that can?'<br />Body: 'So a couple of months back I asked a question on  an alternate history scenario on r/SouthAsianHistory and one on this subreddit. Basically the scenario was this: "What if the Mauryan Empire was still around when the Europeans made first contact with India? Would they have been able to resist their colonization efforts?" Based on the responses on got from the, IMO the Mauryan Empire would have be able to resist European Invaders as long as they had a strong enough navy and army to resist them. This could be achieved by maintaining good relations with the Muslim Empires and learning how to make new military technology from them like the forging of steel and the manufacturing of gunpowder.\n\nBut then I started to think about another issue. A Mauryan Empire might have been able to resist European Empire for at least 2 centuries, **but** once the Industrial Revolution begins would they be able to resistance Europeans encroachment on a military level? For that matter, would they be able to compete with Europe in the global market once Europeans industrialized their respective economies? Or would they become a Vestigial Empire similar to the Qing Dynasty from the OT, where they are going into a cultural and economic decline with parts of the Empire divided into spheres of influence? If the later happens how would the Europeans divide India between themselves?\n\nI also did some research on what the  Mauryan economy was like. Basically most of the economy was centered around agriculture and trade. The agricultural sector was completely controlled by the state and most of the trade in India was controlled by the Guilds and the government taxed both in order to fund its state projects. But would this change after Europe went through the Industrial Revolution? Would the Mauryans enact reforms, similar to the Japanese and Thais, to protect itself from foreign invaders and compete with the Europeans on an economic scale? Or would they choose not to enact these reforms, because of opposition from groups who don\'t want the Empire to change its values (Ex: religious groups, adherents to the Arthastra) to groups who are afraid that they will lose power after these changes are made (Ex: Trade and Artisan Guilds)?\n\nOne more thing if anyone believes the Mauryans are unable to make the necessary changes, which historical Empire do you think can make the necessary reforms that will prevent India from being turned into a colony? The Mughals, the Guptas, the Delhi Sultanate, the Marathas? Please explain your choice.'<br />Author: 'jacky986'  id: 'jyn0mk'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jyn0mk/would_the_mauryan_empire_would_be_best_suited_to/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Is it time for a new Deccan?'<br />Body: 'Is it time for the joint family called India to split amicably and go their separate ways? Soon it will be 75 years of the experiment called India cobbled together by the British when they left in 1947. India was created as a hodgepodge of different ethnicity, language and religion.  The population has reached unmanageable level. Aspirations of the current and future generation will never be achieved with this explosion of population in the 21st century. The Northern states are expected to add another 25-30 crores over the next 30 years.  \n\nThere\'s nothing common between the people of North and the South. The language, culture and food are different. Many south indian have more in common genealogically with people in many islands in Indian ocean. So it may the right time for the Deccan states to go their separate way and form "Deccan India". \nStates like UP and Bihar are holding back the southern states from fulfilling it\'s  potential. And there\'s no reason to wait another 30-40 years for any meaningful progress. The current crop of leaders across all political specteums do not have the vision or the ability to lead the country of 130 crores to a better future. The country has no meaningful natural resource to count on. The last 50 years were supported by Indians working in ME and the IT boom after Y2K. With automation, growth in tech industry will stagnate or even shrink in the next decade. With right wing sentiment growing across the world, immigration will likely be affected adding to the frustrations of the youth. Service industry which has been the main bread earner for past 2 decades appears to be losing ground to other low cost countries like Philipines and Mexico.\n\nThe Ambanis have split and so have other business families.\n\nSo it may be beneficial for both North India and Deccan India to go their separate ways amicably  in the long run. \nWould the 75th independence day in the year 2022be the right occasion for this?'<br />Author: 'direstraits66'  id: 'jygha1'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jygha1/is_it_time_for_a_new_deccan/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 6.1'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Who is the the perfect sannyƒÅsƒ´ or the perfect yogƒ´ ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyƒÅsƒ´, the perfect yogƒ´."\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What is the difference between the desires of an impersonalist sannyasi , a mystic Yogi and a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person ?**\n\n**Answer 2 :** "The sannyƒÅsƒ´s sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj√±as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogƒ´ who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus he is the perfect sannyƒÅsƒ´, or perfect yogƒ´.\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 6.1, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4wjg8b8ul061.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92af70945d0ba63e378b413cb17d5cf19ad23e08\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

The living entity has no separate independant identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yogƒ´s who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is simultaneously a sannyƒÅsƒ´ and a yogƒ´. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j√±ƒÅna and yoga processes, is automatically served in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j√±ƒÅna and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the constitutional position of a living entity ? How he can attain it ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : How a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can simultaneously work as a sannyƒÅsƒ´ and a yogƒ´ ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter - 6: Sankhya-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/59twnxwfki061.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb9a98ab516eb36b3a8932b50c61deb11c36b184)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jy3yf4'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jy3yf4/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is62/</li>

And all of this should be done, at 1/10th the cost of the existing competition. Some PMs would quit, most would tell you have gone mad....\n\nThat was the enormity of the task that was being faced by **Govt Officials**, in 1977, who wanted to do something about the fact that only 6% of India, had access to safe water. For the layperson, the answer is, why don't they just get pumps....\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of the pumps then were too expensive, not mass producible, too varied and so fragile, that 75% of the pumps, were inoperable at any given point in time. And women found it difficult to use, which was bad, because 80% of the water collection was done by them...\n\n\n**Enter Swedish engineer, Oscar Carlsson and UNICEF.**\n\nHe took existing pump designs, added uniformed jigs &amp; fixtures, mounted it on concrete and ensured water quality. He even took inspiration from oil rigs which drilled in rocks. Result was the India Mk 2 water pump.\n\n\nThis ubiquitous water pump, revolutionized India. By 1995, more than 2.5 million pumps were installed, ensuring a pump for every 150 Indians. More than 500 million people got access to safe water. Water borne diseases like Cholera reduced...\n\nWater, the vital ingredient of life, was no longer inaccessible. Not only that, the pump was so sturdy, that it might have been made out of adamantium. Because of this, we started exporting them to African countries, to solve their water woes. And it was a success there too.\n\nMany countries imposed heavy duties on all the pumps apart from the Indian Mk 2 pump. The India Mk2 pump was a transformative development, which changed generations. It also was a symbol of Indian innovation and proof that if we wanted to so something, we could.\n\nThe India Mk2 pump changed lives. And ensured one Swedish dude named Oscar Carlsson, who most of us, have no clue about, will forever be in our histroy books, as a guy who changed India.

However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyƒÅsƒ´, the perfect yogƒ´.\n\n.\n\nThe sannyƒÅsƒ´s sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj√±as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogƒ´ who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus he is the perfect sannyƒÅsƒ´, or perfect yogƒ´.

The Yamuna-Ghaggar plain or Delhi Doab is a plain lying between Sutlej (in Punjab) in the north and Yamuna in the south. This makes up most of the area of the state. The other regions are the Lower Shivalik Hills to the north-east, which are the foothills of the Himalayas, the Bagar tract, a semi-desert region bordering Rajasthan and the hill regions in the south, consisting of the northern-most tip of the Aravalli mountain range. \n\n**Political Geography and Cities:**\n\nThe capital of Haryana is Chandigarh while the largest city is Faridabad. Other important cities include Panipat, Ambala, Hisar and Yamunanagar. \n\nThe state is divided into 22 districts, 72 sub-divisions, 93 tehsils, 50 sub-tehsils, 140 blocks, 154 cities and towns, 6,841 villages, 6212 villages panchayats and numerous smaller dhanis. \n\n**Language:** \n\nThe official language of Haryana is Hindi. About 88% of the population speak Hindi as a mother tongue. This includes \\~48% of the population that reports Hindi as their mother tongue, \\~37% who speak Haryanvi, a dialect of Hindi and the remaining \\~3% of the Hindi-speaking population speaking various dialects such as Braj Bhasha, Bagri, Mewati, etc. \n\nOther major languages are Urdu and Punjabi. From 1966 to 1969, Telugu was taught as a second language in schools but was an official second language of the government. From 1969 to 2010, Tamil took up this position despite there being no Tamil speakers in the state. \n\n[Gurudwara Panjokhra Sahib.

If any of you are kind enough to provide information, it is very much welcome.\n\nI feel that the spirit of Diwlai was always in lights and calmness. In family and warmth.  Fireworks are the complete opposite of that. The problem is, while originally the idea may have been something else, it has now been changed. \n\nThe issue is that even with texts, even with documented literature, not much of it has remianed pure. In the sense, it has been diluted or influenced, year after year, by the people who were influential at the time. \n\nI feel the issue isn't a technicality. It isn't that well maybe at those times it wasn't a Hindu tradition, but it was added a couple of centuries ago. There is absolutely no use dealing with technicalities. \n\nWhat matters is the spirit and the message. What is Hindu about bursting fireworks? \nIs making noise important, is creating smoke important? What is the essence? What are we celebrating? \n\nI feel, when it comes down to it, we are celebrating family, celebrating our brotherhood. It doesn't matter how we choose to do it, whether with lamps or fireworks. Our celebration doesn't lie in either, but in our togetherness. While personally I may find lighting lamps better, to each his own. \n\nWhat we shouldnt forget is that whatever we choose to do, let us try to get close to each other, try to remember that whatever we may believe in, in thr end, we are all.people."<br />Author: 'Suki1387'  id: 'jxblc2'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jxblc2/cmv_fireworks_being_hindu_or_not_is_not_black_and/</li>

I would request you to try mentally chanting this mantra and focus the mind in listening to the mental sound of chanting - "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare." You can learn its pronunciation here: https://youtu.be/VP623hMbAIA. Two more beautiful Hare Krishna mantra recordings here: https://youtu.be/K9OjsTUZj0g and https://youtu.be/vofoqsZ71QQ. This mantra is especially powerful for healing grief.  The healing vibration of this mantra deeply soothes both body and mind ‚Äì this technique cured my 12 year old chronic headache problem in few days. This technique brings the mind in the present. Chant it for at least 20 min daily and in your free time as much as you like. I myself do so. It has helped me a lot. See whether it works well for you. One need not believe in anything for this technique ‚Äì I myself am an atheist. Just try it as an experiment.\r\n\r\nPoint 2. Also please try taking Lion‚Äôs Mane mushroom ‚Äì it is good for repairing neurons and thus making nervous system and brain healthy with all kinds of cool benefits. Please read its reviews here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/reviews/B002WJ2ALO and here:  https://www.lionsmanesave.com/reviews. Dosage and brand matters. I am taking 4.5 g from this brand ‚Äì Brain Forza Lion‚Äôs Mane Mushroom ‚Äì it is improving my memory a lot which got badly damaged due to complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder caused by severe child abuse by my narcissistic evil parents. I plan to increase the dosage by 1.5 g every month till whatever upper limit my body can manage so that I can gain my original good memory of childhood.  \r\n\r\nPoint 3. Narcissists are true devils of this world. They may be even your close relatives including parents. Please read this article - https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-deal-with-a-narcissist - and successfully deal with all narcissists in your life.\r\n\r\nPoint 4. Please listen regularly to these deeply soothing music videos from India: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP21dt4CdjvpYT66ajABONzAPmPJDrzgB. \r\n\r\nPoint 5. Please become a proud vegan (meaning, consume only plant diets) for the sake of universal love, good climate and our optimum physical and mental health - becoming vegan is the best for our animal brethren also. Non-vegan diet is evil. So, let us become vegan at the earliest. \r\n\r\nHugs ü§ó and best wishes for your healing, \r\n\r\nLove and regards,\r\n\r\nNeo\r\n\r\nps: Please join r/SarvodayaParivar ‚Äì In this community we allow our users to share all healing techniques again and again as much as they want apart from giving words of emotional support.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL the song Ge Ge Ge from movie Bobby is actually a folk Goanese song about Goan Inquisition of Hindus.'<br />Body: '&gt; in 1620, the Viceroy issued an edict that no Hindu could marry in the Portuguese territories. Hindus were forced to either cross the river and go to the main island in Adil Shah‚Äôs territories to marry. They couldn‚Äôt even cremate their dead. They had to cremate their dead in boats in the middle of the river, because they couldn‚Äôt cremate them on the island, simply because it was a Hindu rite and it was considered heretical. So the pain of Hindus during those days is reflected in the Konkani folk song. I don‚Äôt know how many of you have heard of this song, it is there in Bobby movie, ‚Äúhau sahiba poltodi voita damu na lagnani koita‚Ä¶‚Äù Aao saheba poltodi voita, poltodi voita‚Äù, actually means ‚ÄòI want to cross the river‚Äô. That term ‚ÄúI want to cross the river‚Äù has a very sad meaning in Goa, because it means that I want to escape from the Portuguese territories, ‚ÄòI want to cross the river and I want to go to a safer place‚Äô. And that is why the person says ‚Äúhau sahiba, poltodi voita damu la lagnani koita‚Äù. Damu is a metaphor for a Hindu. So I want to attend Damu‚Äôs marriage that is why I want to cross the river. I want to go to a safer place, ‚Äúmaka saiba vat kalna‚Äù. ‚ÄòI am stopped from going across. So dear boatman please take me there‚Äò. And that person says ‚ÄúGe, ge ge, ge re sahiba‚Äù and the boatman says, ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt‚Äô because he is terrified of the Portuguese. So the whole song is about the person saying that I will give you my bangles, I will give you my nose ring, I will give you my paon ka paigan, I will give you all the gold I have, but please take me poltadi. I want to preserve my dharma. That is the meaning of this song. But now it has become a happy folk song. But there is a lot of pathos in it.\n\n\u200b\n\nMore on GoanInquisition here:\n\nhttps://indictales.com/2018/04/18/the-religious-oppression-faced-by-hindus-under-portuguese-colonial-rule/'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'jx1kne'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jx1kne/til_the_song_ge_ge_ge_from_movie_bobby_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Reminder: British East India Company was FDI as well....'<br />Body: "There seems to be this myth FDI is good blah blah etc. It's only good when applied to specific sectors (non defense obv) in which there is an actual technology deficit. Otherwise all it does is ship the profits of India's GDP abroad. So Like China blocked American tech companies now it has its own. India which (supposedly has English) and was way ahead of China in software is now left behind in the dust because all the profits from India were shipped to Google, Facebook, Msft. We don't have any local tech titans to propagate research and invest in upcoming startups... FDI makes sense in stuff like education (non profit and massive tech gap). FDI makes sense in jet engines... Letting FDI for temporary economic gains is height of stupidity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason India's gdp grew in 90s and early 2000s was due to decentralization and abolition of license raaj, not by unlimited FDI. FDI doesn't fix structural economic issues, FDI is more like a loan with a repayment for ever. But you can use the loan to make more money than the loan repayment amount.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFDI also  makes sense in the export sector as then there is 0 harm done to India, if a company wants to setup a plant for the purposes of exporting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe British East India Company was FDI at its finest. Foreigners invest in india, hier local militias to secure their supply chains. Being private they are way better than kings and in the process beat them all. Then for 150 years they shipped profits to their owners in UK..."<br />Author: 'teresenahopaaega'  id: 'jwsulg'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jwsulg/reminder_british_east_india_company_was_fdi_as/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Musings of a Tin Shed.'<br />Body: 'A storm washes over a small town. A kind of town which is picturesque, whose pictures tell you stories of memories and easy days. \n\nIt blows over many sheds, poles and trees. But one particular tree is uprooted which seems very odd. Its odd because it was a large tree, strong with deep roots. If you looked at it you wouldn\'t guess it could be uprooted.\n\nBut it did. Lying across the green lawn in the open ground which had enjoyed its large shadow for years, now bearing its weight. The roots lay bare, gawking at the passerbys. Exposing the part which wasnt meant for the public eye. \n\nThe only difficult question is to decide who lost the most. The roots which lost its dignity or the soil which lost its roof. \n\nA tin shed which had blown near the tree lay on the roadside, wondering. \n\n"How?"\n\nThe shed mused to himself\n\n"Is it wrong to hold on too strong?"\n\n"Is it wrong to give it your all?"\n\nThe dust was the sole admirer and the uncaring sun burned hot. The sermon moved on.\n\n"Why you must dig so deep, tree my friend? If only you were more malleable, more welcoming of change you would not lay there, lifeless"\n\nA car stopped near the shed, a door opened and shut.\n\nThe tin shed listened hard for he could not look who walked towards it.\n\nAs the shadow of his owner cast on its bent body, it felt getting lifted off the road.\n\nHe listened to the owner say as he walked back to his car.\n\n"You still haven\'t given your all, I will have you up in no time"'<br />Author: 'Albela__Sajan'  id: 'jwf0sz'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jwf0sz/musings_of_a_tin_shed/</li>

But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord ≈öiva and Lord BrahmƒÅ. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam ƒ´≈õvarƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πÅ parama·πÅ mahe≈õvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.\n\n.\n\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j√±ƒÅna-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with mƒÅyƒÅ (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over mƒÅyƒÅ, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one's practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirvƒÅ·πáa. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, ƒÅsana, pratyƒÅhƒÅra, dhyƒÅna, dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ, prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma, and samƒÅdhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.\n\n.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the ≈örƒ´mad-Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K·πõ·π£·πáa Consciousness.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the difference between a living entity and the Supreme Lord ? How one can attain perfect peace ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What is K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ? What is the main cause of living entity's sufferings ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdawjr3w3qz51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b26431a0e3d6a639671149627d4dc23929da384\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jvm3h3'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jvm3h3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is529/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Blatant mishandling of COVID control measures in Maharashtra cities.'<br />Body: "Since no one has said anything about it yet. And no news media is approving to publish it, I'll just leave it here.\n\nIncident 1: Pune.\nThe police in Pune is more bothered about charging fines from people not wearing masks inside cars of all places. If you drive around Pune you will notice at least one person wearing a mask. And the rest are roaming around freely without masks or gloves. But of all the people police is bothered, they would go for the person not wearing a mask inside a car. I purposefully drove through a busy junction in Pune(Aundh) without wearing a mask. Several people walking around not wearing masks by the way. And I got swiftly pulled over by a couple of cops and charged a quick fine of 1000 INR. On asking the cops why they aren't pulling pedestrians over, they simply said 'Order is to catch 4 wheelers'. Cool.\n\nIncident 2: Mumbai\nTried the same thing in Worli. Got pulled over by a cop who himself wasn't wearing a mask. I asked him why he pulled me over. He says, I should not be asking questions and it's an order. Got charged quickly for not wearing a mask and I thanked the Mumbai Police guy for doing his duty. Can't even ask questions anymore here, can we? \n\nI am sure similar incidents are also happening in other cities. But I just couldn't sit back not sharing the stories from Maharashtra.\n\nLeave alone the cops, I'm surprised that the people aren't very serious about wearing masks either. And no one is doing anything about it. At least 4 out of 5 Amazon delivery guys are also not wearing any masks either. Pretty sure it's the same in other countries also.

      <li>Title::: 'The Legend of Purandara Dasa: Scholar, saint, poet, music composer'<br />Body: "Purandara Dasa was a saint and poet from current-day Karnataka. He is perhaps the most popular and greatest composer from the Haridasa tradition that flourished under the Vijaynagara kings. This was part of the wider Bhakti movement, from the Nayanars and Alvars of Tamil Nadu, to the Haridasas of Karnataka and further East and across North-India, most famous being Tulasidas, the composer of the Ram Charitramanas. \n\nThe Haridasas of Karnataka wrote devotional songs, with each Dasa having an ‚ÄòAnkita naama‚Äô, the name of a particular form of the Vaishnavite God that was repeated in every song. The Ankita naama of Purandara Dasa was ‚ÄòPurandhara Vitthala‚Äô. \n\nPurandara Dasa was born as Srinivasa Nayaka and inherited his father‚Äôs flourishing business of diamonds and gemstones. Despite his great wealth, he was known as an extremely stingy person, never having any time for the poor or needy. He lived an austere life, spending only on bare necessities and hoarding the rest of his wealth. \n\nOne day, a poor Brahmin beggar came to his shop asking for alms for the purpose of performing the thread ceremony of his son. As usual, Srinivasa shooed him away quite heartlessly. The beggar went on and eventually found his way to Srinivasa‚Äôs house. Here, his wife, a lady of great piety and devotion, felt completely sorry for the state of the beggar and his pleas in the name of the Lord to give him something to tide over his troubles. Without thinking for a moment, she handed over her very valuable nose-ring to the beggar. \n\nThe beggar returned straight to Srinivasa‚Äôs shopping, hoping to get a loan with the nose-ring as surety. Srinivasa however was skilled in his trade and immediately recognised it as his wife‚Äôs jewel. He demanded from the Brahmin where he obtained the ring. The beggar confessed that a kind, pious lady had melted at his pleas and handed it to him. He immediately shut his shop, rushed home and demanded from his wife to see her nose-ring. \n\nIn a complete fix and extremely fearful of her husband, knowing his attachment to wealth and miserly nature, she told her husband she would return with the ring and went to the God‚Äôs room of her home. Here, she broke her bangles into small pieces and placed it before the Lord and vowed to kill herself by swallowing the glass unless He gives her a way out. When she reached her hand to take the broken bangles, they disappeared and she found the nose-ring there. She handed over this to Srinivasa. \n\nSrinivasa examined the nose-ring and found it was exactly the same as the original. He immediately rushed to his shop to seek out the beggar, but he was nowhere to be found. It was in that moment that he understood that the beggar was none other than Sri Hari himself. He realised his ‚Äòmoha‚Äô towards material wealth and left his shop and all the gems and jewels open so the townspeople could take whatever they pleased. He gave up all his wealth and became an ascetic, living only on the alms that people gave out to him in the form of rice and vegetables. Everyday, he invited poor Brahmins to his house for food and ate only if there was any food left-over from the alms after feeding those who came to his house. \n\nEventually, his quest to learn more took him to Vyasaraja Thirtharu, the Rajguru of Krishna Devaraya, who anointed him Purandara Dasa. Purandara Dasa often performed his compositions at the court of Vijaynagara. \n\nHaving heard the legend of Srinivasa‚Äôs story, Krishna Deva Raya decided to test him. Everyday, along with rice, the Raya ordered his courtiers to add some unpolished gems. The skilled gemstone merchant Srinivasa would recognise it immediately. But not Purandara Dasa. Every day, as he washed the rice to cook for his disciples, he would throw aside the raw gems without a second glance. Not believing this tale, the Raya himself came disguised as a mendicant and struck up a conversation with his wife. His wife complained about the stones that someone was placing in the rice every day and wondered who might be behind this cruel joke. \n\nKrishna Deva Raya finally revealed himself and greatly honoured Purandara Dasa. \n\nPurandara Dasa‚Äôs Kruthis (compositions) according to tradition, number either 75,000 or 4,75,000. Few hundred are still known and actively sung today. He is known as the ‚ÄòPitamaha of Karnataka Sangeeta‚Äô. His compositions were in simple, conversational Kannada, with the belief that with true Bhakti one could attain God, the knowledge of Sanskrit was unnecessary, nor was being born in the right kula. Vyasa Thirtharu himself stated the famous line - Daasarendare Purandara Daasaru/‡≤¶‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥Ü‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤∞‡≥Ü ‡≤™‡≥Å‡≤∞‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤∞ ‡≤¶‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥Å meaning ‚ÄòA Daasa means Purandara Dasa‚Äô, a way to say he is the ultimate and ideal Daasa. \n\nHis Kruthis are incredibly popular and widely sung today as well. Among the most popular are \n\n‡≤ú‡≤ó‡≤¶‡≥ã‡≤¶‡≥ç‡≤ß‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤£ ‡≤Ü‡≤°‡≤ø‡≤∏‡≤ø‡≤¶‡≤≥‡≥Å ‡≤Ø‡≤∂‡≥ã‡≤¶‡≥Ü - JagadoddharaNa adisidaLu yashode. A song praising Shri Krishna, his qualities and virtues, while also honouring Yashoda maate as the one who innocently played with him as an ordinary baby son ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW55f0JZNPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW55f0JZNPI))\n\n‡≤®‡≤æ ‡≤®‡≤ø‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤® ‡≤ß‡≥ç‡≤Ø‡≤æ‡≤®‡≤¶‡≥ä‡≤≥‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≤≤‡≥Å ‡≤∏‡≤¶‡≤æ - Naa ninna dhyanadhoLiralu sadaa. A song stating how even if given all the hardships in the world, if he is in the constant dhyaana of the Lord, he has nothing to fear. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4RSnnAN8YE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4RSnnAN8YE))\n\n‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤ø ‡≤§‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≥Ä‡≤∞‡≤æ - Raagi tandeera. Have you brought raagi for the seeker of alms? It‚Äôs a beautiful play on words in Kannada. First, Purandara Dasa asks ‚ÄòHave you brought raagi?‚Äô. Followed by this, he goes on to describe the kind of ragi. ‚ÄòYogya-raagi‚Äô, ‚ÄòBhoghya-raagi‚Äô, ‚ÄòBhagyavanta-raagi‚Äô. However, this can also be read as ‚ÄòYogyar-aagi‚Äô, ‚Äòbhogyar-aagi‚Äô, ‚ÄòBhagyavantar-aagi‚Äô. Aagi means 'become'. Thus he is urging the one giving the alms to become blessed and fortunate by giving to the needy. The entire composition is a word play on raagi and aagi. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHVeMPeCyBw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHVeMPeCyBw))\n\n‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Æ ‡≤Æ‡≤Ç‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≤µ ‡≤ú‡≤™‡≤ø‡≤∏‡≥ã - Raama mantrava japiso. It extols humans to repeat the Raama mantra, and lists all the good qualities of just the utterance of the name of Shri Rama. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQBGpuAEj0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzQBGpuAEj0))\n\n‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï ‡≤¨‡≤ø‡≤Ç‡≤¶‡≤ø‡≤ó‡≥Ü - taarakka bindige - Oh sister, bring the earthen pot, I shall go fill it with water. If the pot breaks, it will just cost a penny. And then he goes on to describe what kind of water he will fill into the pot, water that is rich with the name of Rama and Govinda. And this water, he will take to the Bindu Maadhava Ghat, or the final destination. The pot here represents the body, the water represents karma accrued over the lifetime. At the end of our life, we carry with us only our karma. (A modern version that I like a lot - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhIn2nLF0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAhIn2nLF0k))\n\nSuch are his compositions, simple, full of metaphorical meanings and supreme mastery over both, Vedanta and the Kannada language. These are but a few of hundreds that are sung by all practioners of Carnatic music today. \n\nPurandara Dasa passed away in Hampi in 1565, a few months before the sack of Vijaynagara by the armies of the Bahamani Sultanates. Even if the empire was physically destroyed, its legacy of art, architecture, practices and scholarly contributions to modern Hinduism means that it lives on to this day. There is perhaps no large temple south of the Tungabhadra that hasn't been either renovated, rebuilt or expanded by the Rayas of Vijaynagara. \n\nLet us also raise our voice about this - [https://twitter.com/\\_ugra\\_/status/842262756296396800/photo/1](https://twitter.com/_ugra_/status/842262756296396800/photo/1)\n\nThe samadhi of the greatest King of Vijaynagara, whose exploits in the battle of Raichur are the stuff of legend, lies in a sorry state. (Historians debate whether this is indeed his samadhi, given that the only source for the claim is local folklore and not inscriptional evidence)\n\nPS - Source for some stories and details are my grandparent's words.

Again, NCRPR intervened and got her rescued. Girl says he had nikah with her after converting her to Islam. Also learnt that he is already married\n\n&gt;This is ground reality while films like #Laxmii glamourise elopement with much older Muslim men. Rahman made physical relations with the child. Girl cried and told officials she wants to go back to her parents What I am now wondering is, will Bengal police only stop at POCSO or also probe to find out the role of maulvis and mosques in conversion-nikah?\n\n&gt;**Despite advisory by SC commissions to state govts, this aspect is routinely ignored. Police seldom go after maulvis and the mosques who facilitate forceful conversion of minors for nikah. At most, police add IPC 420 in the case for "fraud" documentation. Which is why I have been asking for a special Act for such cases.**\n\n&gt;An appeal to WBPolice: Please probe the nikah and conversion too, and the role of the maulvis and mosques involved\n\n&gt;**Child commision head Kanoongo Priyank\n tells me that once again, police failed to invoke POCSO against kidnapper (Sohidul Rehman, 28), treating it as ‚Äúelopement‚Äù**\n\nhttps://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1327908413221658624\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/politics/minor-hindu-girl-kidnapped-by-muslim-man-from-west-bengal\n\n&gt;I am perhaps the only journalist raising it time and again. Due to lack of awareness or shielding the accused, police treat kidnappings of minor girls as elopements. Trafficking of minor girls should be top-priority issue, but isn‚Äôt. In this case, accused even had nikah with her\n\n&gt;Heard a recording of the girl with counselors after her rescue: she revealed that **her kidnapper, Rehman, forced her to recite ayats from Quran when in confinement**\n\nhttps://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1328006690759852032\n\n&gt;The 14-year-old was abducted by Sohidul Rehman, who is 28 &amp; already married, on 7 Oct. Police reached her on 12 Nov.\n\n&gt;The accused Sohidul Rehman. From Bengal, he took her to Bihar, then Rajasthan, then Gujarat where the Bengal CID found him.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1328245912628412417\n\n\n&gt;So many, so many cases of a similar kind in India where Muslim men prey on Hindu women, particularly minor girls, for conversion and starting a Muslim lineage. But no special laws to deal with this. \nIn Muslim Pakistan, the govt facilitates such abduction-conversions now\n\nhttps://twitter.com/swati_gs/status/1328249201289961472\n\n&gt;Why do the Khans and Khanums never pick up these cases? Never speak a word for these Hindu victims? never condemn men from their own community for doing this? With such alarming frequency, it\'s impossible they don\'t notice.

A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of this:\n\ndar≈õana-dhyƒÅna-sa·πÅspar≈õair matsya-k≈´rma-viha·πÖgamƒÅ·∏•\n\nsvƒÅnya patyƒÅni pu·π£·πáanti tathƒÅham api padmaja.\n\n"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"\n\nThe fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, although far away from the Lord\'s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly-by engagement in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 5.26, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36769983klz51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fbae67bdd79a9f08c7d7a0fbbd2daa67bff5d9f\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nBeing engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can immediately understand one's spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one's activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.\n\n.\n\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, ƒÅsana, prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma, pratyƒÅhƒÅra, dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ, dhyƒÅna, and samƒÅdhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the pratyƒÅhƒÅra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\n\n.\n\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by the a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga.\n\n.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the symptoms of a liberated person ?**\n\n.\n\n**Question 2 : What are the benefits of a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga ? How K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is different from it?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 5: Karma-yoga ‚Äî Action in K·πõ·π£·πáa Consciousness](https://preview.redd.it/yuqpne62jjz51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e554db329944bfc992fa99d03c9bd3ea14ce3f74)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jv1kiq'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jv1kiq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is52728/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Azerbaijan wins war, Israeli operation in Iran, and Malawi's President-for-life"<br />Body: 'Welcome to another edition of the Geopolitics thread, where we discuss the latest news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India - please share stories that caught your attention in the comments. Here are some stories to start the conversation:\n\n# Top 5 stories\n\n1. [Azerbaijan defeats Armenia in war over Nagoro-Karabakh](https://apnews.com/article/peacekeeping-forces-azerbaijan-russia-vladimir-putin-armenia-07679eadaeb535be478331e6113463c9)\n\nIn one of the rare instances after WW2 where one side decisively won a war, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a Russia-brokered agreement to end their short but bloody. With this treaty, Armenia will give up control of a large swath of territory that it took control of after the fall of the Soviet Union, but which the world recognizes as part of Azerbaijan. The Azeris won the war through extensive use of Turkish drones that destroyed most of Armenia\'s army. Villagers in the disputed Nagoro-Karabakh region were seen burning them homes before fleeing to Armenia. Armenia itself witnessed massive protests and an assassination attempt on their Prime Minister.\n\n2. [Ethiopia appears to be approaching civil war](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54932333)\n\nThe PM of Ethiopia ordered federal troops to invade and bomb rebels in the province of Tigray, in a move that has seen mutinies and seizure of military equipment. The conflict goes back to Ethiopia\'s previous bloody civil war to overthrow the country\'s military dictatorship. The Tigray People\'s Liberation Front (TPLF) led that movement and won, but now claims that the federal government led by Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy Ahmed has failed to hold timely elections and is therefore illegitimate. Abiy\'s government consider the TPLF to be a terrorist group.\n\n3. [Al Qaeda\'s No. 2 leader killed in Iran by Israeli agents](https://www.foxnews.com/world/abu-mohammed-al-masri-al-qaedas-no-2-killed-in-us-israel-joint-operation-in-iran)\n\nIn newly-revealed information, Israel\'s Mossad spy agency, using intelligence provided by the CIA, assassinated Abu Mohammed al-Masri, the second-highest ranking member of Al Qaeda who was hiding under an alias in Iran. Al-Masri is wanted in the US for the 1998 coordinated bombings of the US missions in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, which was seen as a precursor to the 9/11 attacks in New York. The assassination happened on the anniversary of the bombings - August 7. His daughter Maryam, who was the daughter in-law of Osama bin Laden and seen as a future terrorist leader, was also killed in the assassination. \n\n4. [Trump claims US election, in which he lost, was rigged](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/politics/trump-biden-election/index.html)\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events after virtually every pollster and media organization projected that Democrat Joe Biden had won the 2020 US election, President Donald Trump refused to accept defeat and has instead claimed - without proof - that the counting was rigged. Trump has refused to honor the longstanding tradition of conceding to the winner of the election, and his administration has refused to cooperate with Biden\'s transition team. In Washington, DC, Trump drove by a large crowd of his supporters who were protesting against "stealing the vote." The protesters eventually met anti-Trump protesters, and things turned violent in a country that has rarely seen post-election violence in the modern era.\n\n5. [Coronavirus cases growing alarmingly in Europe](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20201114-france-records-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-as-europe-tightens-restrictions)\n\nEurope is firmly in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus infections, with hospital beds rapidly filling up and death increasing across the continent. Austria, which imposed a partial lockdown two weeks ago, closed all schools and many restaurants even as 77% of new cases could not be traced to a source. Similar measures have been taken in Greece and Italy, among others. Protests have also broken out, notably in Germany, as the economic toll from closures mounts. In the US, cases are rising between 1.5 to 2 lakhs per day, with many rural hospitals being at capacity, although deaths have remained low.\n\n# Geopolitical History: The dictatorship of Hastings Banda\n\nContinuing in the series of African freedom heroes turned dictators, this week\'s spotlight is on Malawi\'s longest-serving "president" and official dictator for life, Dr. Hastings Banda. Born in British Central Africa (later renamed Nyasaland) in 1898, he completed a part of his early education in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) before coming to New York in 1925, and earning an MD in 1937. He then moved to London, where he practiced as a doctor and involved himself with growing movements for African independence after WW2. \n\nHe eventually moved back to his homeland, which was under white minority rule under the Central African Federation (the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland), where he campaigned for independence and black majority rule. He assumed leadership of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and in 1960, after the British agreed to grant the country dominion status, became Prime Minister (the Federation with Rhodesia was terminated as well). In 1964, Malawi (as Nyasaland was renamed) became a Republic within the Commonwealth, following the path of India under Nehru to reject monarchy. However, his dictatorial tendencies soon surfaced.\n\nIn 1966, Banda won as the only candidate in a presidential election, having changed the country from parliamentary to presidential government soon after declaring a republic. Under Banda, all other political parties except for the Congress were banned, making him a de factor dictator since nobody else could be elected. Indeed, in 1970, he became the President for Life of the Congress Party, and in 1971, he was officially declared the President for Life of Malawi as a whole. He built a cult-like following around himself, soon disposing of the need to officially pass legislation. Instead, he simply gave orders that became laws.\n\nUnder Banda, Malawi became a police state - arbitrary arrests, assassination of opponents, wiretapping, mail censoring etc. were routine. All adult citizens were mandated to become members of the Congress and pay a part of their income to the party. All businesses were required to have Banda\'s picture in a frame above any other wall hangings, while he personally dictated women\'s dress code in the country in the name of modesty. He instituted state-controlled economic policies, including  an infamous Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation that stifled small farmers and personally enhanced Banda\'s wealth.\n\nHowever, despite his authoritarian ways at home, Banda was quite popular in the West for his stridently anti-Communist foreign policy. He refused to establish diplomatic ties with any Communist country, supported the American war in Vietnam, and in the most controversial move of all, had diplomatic ties with Apartheid South Africa. Western aid was largely responsible for keeping his dictatorship afloat even as the country\'s economy had all but collapsed. All that ended in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union, when anti-Communist dictators were no longer of any use. \n\nIn 1992, protests against his autocracy broke out and his regime had no funds to stop them. Pressure grew on him both from within and outside the country, and in 1993 a referendum passed to re-institute multi-party democracy and strip him of his title of President for Life. He was defeated in the 1994 elections marking a swift end to one of Africa\'s longest-serving dictators, although his Congress party remains a major force today. He remained unrepentant for being a dictator, often saying that his opponents were but mere "political children." He died at the age of 99 in a South African hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'juz9zo'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/juz9zo/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Personal liberty and quality of life'<br />Body: 'Most people who are against crackers are also against loud speakers. But most issues are so entwined with religious backlash that everyone is afraid of saying anything. \n\nI am against all forms of activities that affects people who have not chosen to be a part of it. \n\nMy problem stems from personal liberty. That everyone has a right to live peacefully in their homes. At any time of the day, be it morning afternoon or night, they have the right to sleep, read, watch something or meditate. Basically whatever they want without outside interference. \n\nThis includes, but it not limited to, loudspeakers for any reasons in residential areas. Firecrackers for any reason in residential areas. Any form of band or dance processions in residential areas. And any type of shop that produces loud noise or smoke in residential areas. \n\nI also think we have a right to use our public property for their intended use. Roads should not be congested for personal, political or religious reasons. \n\nOnly exception is protests because that\'s the point of a protest. \n\nHave you noticed that such things never happen in "posh" areas, especially around the residence of politicians? \n\nLike in my city other areas are crawling with shops, shops occupying the side walks and cutting down any trees in front of them. Any procession passes through these areas. \n\nWhereas the posh areas don\'t have illegal commercial activities, are flush with greenery and no loud processions pass through that area. \n\nPlease see what the government is doing. Rather than them actively doing anything for prosperity, they are making you feel like everything is an attack on your religion. So they are winning votes just by not lifting a finger and polarising everyone. \n\nBasic necessities like greenery, oxygen, and peace and quiet are being made a luxury. \n\nSecularism is seperation of religion and government. But in india they have made it so that every religion gets their way, and common citizens are fucked inside their own homes. \n\nTheir reason is simple. Easiest way to win votes. Look at countries where all citizens get personal liberty. Their governments are decided based on economic policies, corruption, development and quality of life.'<br />Author: 'shermitt'  id: 'jup7v2'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jup7v2/personal_liberty_and_quality_of_life/</li>

How one can get engaged in welfare work for all living entities ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Only a person who is fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can be said to be engaged in welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the knowledge that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of K·πõ·π£·πáa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of K·πõ·π£·πáa. He has no doubt because he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love."\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : Who is called a liberated soul ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** "The real cause of one\'s difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one\'s forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle."  \n.  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 5.25, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0a6fplbjez51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=440fea047887b2c8096c77e114aa4f44eab6b201\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

The BhƒÅgavatam confirms this fact as follows:  \n.  \nyat-pƒÅda-pa·πÖkaja-palƒÅ≈õa-vilƒÅsa-bhaktyƒÅ  \nkarmƒÅ≈õaya·πÅ grathitam udgrathayanti santa·∏•  \ntadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo \'pi ruddha  \nsrotoga·πáƒÅs tam ara·πáa·πÅ bhaja vƒÅsudevam.  \n.  \n"Just try to worship, in devotional service, VƒÅsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive activities." (BhƒÅg. 4.22.39)  \n.  \nIn the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of this:  \n.  \ndar≈õana-dhyƒÅna-sa·πÅspar≈õair matsya-k≈´rma-viha·πÖgamƒÅ·∏•  \nsvƒÅnya patyƒÅni pu·π£·πáanti tathƒÅham api padmaja.  \n.  \n"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"  \n.  \nThe fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, although far away from the Lord\'s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly-by engagement in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : What is brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa state ?**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjhhu3xd1cz51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79eb48797634e25b4427c3e8a451f3b0c6078d3d\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [**Bhagavad Gita Multilingual**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'jug4mb'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jug4mb/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is526/</li>

It is to allow FCRA-NGO ecosystem veto power over India. NGT is doing exactly what it was setup to do. Attack Hindu practises and institutions. The environment is not its agenda, and one does not need a judicial body for that anyway. One needs executive policy.\n\n&gt;The BJP has not only not setup its own interventions but has done little to dismantle UPA ecosystem. NGT doesn\'t need to exist. It boggles the mind that the Marendramodi govt, instead of dismantling the toxic divisive institutions introduced by the UPA such as NGO and "Minority Ministry", has enhanced and empowered them even more. SJW-Left on steroids.\n\n&gt;This is a much bigger plot, involving foreign agencies and Sonia NAC, not just Jairam Ramesh. Ramesh was probably just following "High Command" orders. Agencies seek to control India vs "civil society" NGOs. NGT is a coup, giving them judicial authority. \n\n&gt;The targets are 1. India\'s industrial competitiveness so that it doesn\'t rise as an economic power, like China. 2. Target Hindu traditions to help in the evangelical conversion war, limit public space for Hindu expression, wean children from festivals.\n\n&gt;None of the things is what it appears.

However, in the mean time he applied for building regularisation and authorities approved it with us out of the loop.

The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of K·πõ·π£·πáa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme.

The real cause of one's difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one's forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord.

It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or\xa0patriline.**\n\nname of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes.\xa0**PƒÅ·πáini\xa0defines\xa0gotra\xa0for grammatical purposes as\xa0apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram\xa0(IV. 1. 162), which means "the word\xa0gotra\xa0denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son\'s son." When a person says "I am Vipparla-gotra", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.**\n\nAccording to the\xa0Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\xa02.2.4\xa0Kashyapa, Atri, Vasistha, Vishvamitra, Gautama Maharishi, Jamadagni and Bharadvaja\xa0are seven sages (also known as\xa0saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. \n\n**This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to PƒÅ·πáini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called\xa0gotr√¢vayava.[2]**\n\nOne who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as\xa0tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is\xa0pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is\xa0sapta-rishaye.\n\nOrigin:\n\n**As a\xa0Rigvedic\xa0terms,\xa0gotra\xa0simply means "cow pen" or "herd of cows".[3]\xa0The specific meaning "family, lineage kin"** (as it were "herd within an enclosure") is relatively more recent, first recorded around the mid-1st millennium BCE (e.g.,\xa0Chandogya Upanishad).\n\n**These "lineages" as they developed among the\xa0Brahmins\xa0of that time meant patrilineal descent.** The Brahmanic system was later adopted by other communities, such as the\xa0Kshatriyas\xa0and\xa0Vaishyas[4]\n\n_____________________________\n\n**note :** that\'s kind of false, Kshatriyas also had their own Gotras/tribe, Lord Rama is called "Raghav" because his gotra is Raghu, named after famous King who was ancestor of Lord Rama.\n\nSame for Lord Krishna, He was a Yadava, Descendant of King Yadu, also a famous King and ancestor of Lord Krishna.\n\nThe Kuru Empire\'s royal family is called Kaurav, Another Famous King, Kaurava means Descendants of King Kuru.\n\nAlso notice the word Cow pen and herd, cows were probably seen as most important companion alongside horses, they are called as Mother\'s by Rigvedic people as well if i am not wrong.\n\nIndra is referred as a Bull in rigveda so Heard of cow here most likely mean Children of same "Ancestor".\n\nDuring Vedic age the upper castes generally used to live in a large house complexes, sons used to build their own houses next to their father\'s and same for their children so over the time the entire clan used to live in Same enclosed area* so maybe this is what "Herd of Cow or pen of Cow" mean in literal sense.(Rigveda is mostly poetic)\n\n(*Kuzmina agrees as well.)'<br />Author: 'SiconofVishwamitra'  id: 'jtwp04'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jtwp04/tribe_or_gotra_among_rigvedic_people_and_their/</li>

Is there no other work for everyone else? \n\nI feel it is better to conduct all elections at once and be done with it instead of bothering on with it every year."<br />Author: 'Imperial_Marcher'  id: 'jtlyh7'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jtlyh7/why_cant_all_elections_be_conducted_at_once/</li>
      <li>Title::: "BJP's endorsement of the firecracker ban is not just a commercial disaster, but a cultural one too."<br />Body: "Never in India before has a government forced silenced Diwali on the population. Not sure if even the most vocal supporters of the NDA can support the government's endorsement.\n\nYou go to the markets, already suffering from the Covid impact, and you meet shop owners complaining about the lack of crowds. Crackers ushered separate temporary markets for a week at least, and this time, nothing. And it's not only about crackers here.\n\nPeople visited these temporary markets for crackers, and supplement sales would rise, like those of candles, diyas, and so forth. In a way, it was a nice celebration in the markets for 7 days of the 365, and one evening of bursting crackers. Crowds aren't there! \n\nFor the kind of year, we have had, and the kind of recession we are in, banning anything makes little sense. No wonder why traders hate the BJP, from metal to cracker traders. Even if it was a judicial or NGT order, an order from the GOI would have helped in this aspect, but no!\n\nThoroughly disappointed in the PM as well. When it was about giving up LPG subsidies for the poor, millions of people came forward, so it's not like we don't care for the environment, but to take the fun out of one festival, or endorsing it, is shameful. Spare the middle-class! \n\nAlso, what are we teaching our kids? Kids look forward to a festival for the fun element, and most kids aren't interested in the gift forwarding, or aarti. Most, as I once did, look forward to bursting crackers. You want to enrich kids culturally while making festivals boring? \n\nThe GOI, with its 303 seats, has no power to speak up against the pollution caused by other festivals, pollution caused by other reasons. Fields in Punjab have been burning for a month FFS. No action! But then, you dilute the ONE FESTIVAL ALL HINDUS CELEBRATE! SHAMEFUL!\n\nIt's days like these when I feel that the PM takes his supporters for granted. Again, I mention the PM because the buck stops at him. We credit him for the good things, so we must credit him for the dumb ones too. The cracker ban was uncalled for. GOI should have stepped in.\n\nAs we accept a silenced Diwali today, tomorrow they'll come for Holi, Rakshabandhan, and anything that is important to us. Cultural and commercial disaster, this. I am sure I am not the only one this angry.\n\nThis is happening when there are 303 seats. Imagine the precedent that‚Äôs been set for the time when there shall be no 303 seats. \n\nTell you the truth, had there been a Congress government in the centre, people on the Right would have gone bonkers against the ban. Just stating the truth, we are guilty of giving the BJP a free pass on issues of importance."<br />Author: 'fqxnbbjpcuulijlhwm'  id: 'jtk1ax'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jtk1ax/bjps_endorsement_of_the_firecracker_ban_is_not/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hey Reddit India! Wanted to share an update regarding an earlier post. The iOS version of Strippy is now available.'<br />Body: "Not sure if it's fine by the mods but since my earlier post regarding the launch of our app Strippy  got good support from this community and some of you asked to repost when iOS version is available, here I am.\n\nFor those who are unaware of the last post, here's a sum up: A month ago I along with my few friends launched an android app named Strippy where people can find Indian comics. It‚Äôs an independent app where Indian artists can upload their short comics or long comics in series and earn depending on the views their comics get. We will be paying them from our savings as it's a totally free app without any ads now. Motto is to mainstream the comics culture in India and later animation hopefully.\n\nIt took us longer than expected to make the iOS version live as Apple has some strict guidelines to approve the app submission.\n\nSharing on the progress, the response is good from the close comic community readers but we are struggling to attract normal users who are not aware if such comics exist in India. It sure will take us a very good amount of effort and time to get their attention. \n\nRest, we are constantly working in order to improve the platform.\n\nYour feedback and support remains crucial. Thank You!"<br />Author: 'anantms'  id: 'jtih2h'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jtih2h/hey_reddit_india_wanted_to_share_an_update/</li>

Which companies set a criteria of 80% or above during placements?\n2. When companies or businesses mean 80%+, would they consider someone with 80.xx( except for 80.00) ?\n3. Is the candidate, who has just crossed the cutoff, more likely to be grilled during the interview, in comparison to the guy who has crossed the cutoff by a massive margin?"<br />Author: 'refusestonamethyself'  id: 'jtd0wy'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jtd0wy/questions_regarding_placements_and_12th_boards/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Story behind Maharaja Suraj Mal's attack on Delhi -9th May, 1753 : The Brahmin girl Hardaul and her honour"<br />Body: 'Maharaja Suraj Mal attacked and plundered Old Delhi in 1753, defeating the-then Wazir Ghazi Uddin, but many people don\'t know the reason for it.\n\nDelhi at the time was ruled by Ahmad Shah Bahadur. He used to have a Brahmin servant. Usually, it would be his wife bringing him food, but this time, it was his daughter Hardaul. After giving her father food, she went back home, this was when the Badshah asked the Pandit if that was his daughter. He replied "yes." To which the Badshah responded: "you kept this secret from me, no problem, now listen, Hardaul touched my heart, I want to make her my Begum." \n\nThe Pandit was shaken scared and fell to the emperor\'s feet, begging for mercy and to take back such a request. The emperor simply told him he had 7 days to bring Hardaul to him and dismissed him. When the Pandit reached home. \n\nThe Pandit returned home extremely worried, when his wife asked him what happened tears streamed down his cheek in helplessness. His daughter heard the same, to which she told her father she would die, but not accept Islam. The Badshah had made the Pandit\'s house a target and planned to burn it if he did not fulfill the request. Instead, they imprisoned his daughter and tortured her. \n\nThere was one woman who used to sweep the Badshah\'s floors. She sneaked into the prison and told Hardaul that there is no Hindu king who can come to your aid except Maharaja Surajmal of Lohagarh. She told Hardaul to write the Jat king a letter and reassured her that he will definitely come to her aid. There was no pen, so the sweeper woman got a peacock feather and Hardaul wrote the letter with her blood. Hardaul gave the details of her house and the sweeper woman took the letter to the Pandit-Panditani\'s house, telling them to take it Lohagarh.\n\nWhen the Pandit and his wife reached the darbar of Maharaja Surajmal to narrate the story, they started weeping uncontrollably. The Maharaja heard them and asked who were these grief-stricken people, bring them and we shall hear them. The Pandit and his wife recounted the story, to which the Maharaja ordered a Gujjar by the name Veerpal to take the message of "leave Hardaul or leave Delhi" to the Badshah. When the letter reached the Badshah, he responded to Veerpal, "I knew he would do this. Tell your king that with Hardaul, the Jaatni (his wife) will also be with him, you won\'t be able to free her." Veerpal was so incensed by the words that he took the sword out of scabbard and attained martyrdom in the darbar itself. When the news reached Maharaja Surajmal, he responded, "ab aanve Lohagarh ke Jaat aur Dilli ki hila ko chool aur paat" (Now comes the Jaat of Lohagarh, time to shake Delhi\'s to crumbles).\n\nThe Maharaja attacked and captured what is today Gurgaon and sent the Badshah the message "Surajmal has come to save the honour of his daughter and has come with the Jatni (his wife). Let\'s see if he brings back Hardaul or Badshah takes my wife." \n\nThe Mughal Badshah sends his army, but eventually the Jats fight them with such bravery and send them running. Eventually, they reach the gates. The Badshah fell to the Maharaja\'s feet, shivering. Suddenly, Surajmal smells the fragrance of the cowherd. Hardaul is saved from Mughal captivity.\n\nIt\'s after this that Mughal spines would chill upon hearing the Maharaja\'s name. \n\n‡§§‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§§‡§≤‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç, ‡§ï‡§ü‡§æ‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç ‡§á‡§∂‡§æ‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§§‡•à‡§Ç,\n\n‡§Ö‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§π ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ö‡§æ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ú‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ü ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡§™‡•Å‡§ü ‡§Ü‡§≥‡§è ‡§§‡•à‡§Ç‡•§ \n\nhttp://nidanaheights.com/images/PDF/aflatoon-maharaja-surajmal-lohagarh.pdf'<br />Author: 'Shefali_Lamba'  id: 'jta35c'<br />Score:76<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jta35c/story_behind_maharaja_suraj_mals_attack_on_delhi/</li>

Have Ex Muslims ever done anything substantial ? Ambedkar as an Ex Hindu literally burnt the Manusmiriti and held mass burning ceremonies. He even lead a freaking mass conversion from Hinduism. It does not matter if you like him or not. What one can not doubt is his personal dislike of Hinduism and its followers (he mellowed down towards the end but then that is a different topic). \n\nEx Christians like Harris write letters to their own countries explaining how their faith is bad while even liberal Christians shit on their faith nowadays. \n\nCompare it to Muslims. The Ex Muslims (there is a sub for Indian Ex Muslims) generally tend to focus half on the time on Islamophobia and in the other half of the time are busy explaining as to how Non Muslim conservatism is busy harming Muslims. A look at the Indian Ex Muslim sub will make you feel as if you have landed on a Muslim sub. Compare it to the sub for Ex Hindus. The difference is obvious and intentional. While the Apostates of other faiths sincerely criticise their religions, Ex Muslims use their apostasy as a card to duck any incoming criticism of their "Ex" community while critiquing other faiths. Rarely do they talk about their own faith which would obviously cast doubts on their intentions. I mean if criticism of other faiths was the idea behind an Ex Muslim sub, are not there enough Ex Hindu Ex Christian subs already ? \n\nCard carrying Atheists like Javed Akhtar launch books with fundamentalists such as Mahmood Madani (a prominent member of Jamaat E Islami Hind, an organisation which was in news for justifying ISIS) wherein every blame of Islamic terrorism is laid on America and Muslims are presented merely as victims of Islamic Extremism instead of the perpetrators. \n\nFrom the article which describes the book launch-\n\n\n&gt;And it is not about a clash of civilization but the sheer politics that spearheaded a movement of hatred against Muslims and Islam.

Have you ever seen any other person who believes in a religion and is a communist cadet at the same time ? Unlikely to have seen. However Muslims claim to be communists.

Typically two groups would vie for power. \n\nThe first group consists of (mainly but not mostly) wealthy and well-educated minorities (based on identity). They tend to be very liberal in public and say all the progressive things that the disenfranchised want to hear, but in private, they may be quite different. \n\nThe second group consists of people from the majority identity. They're right-wing, conservative, nationalistic. Usually they say the same things in public and private, which can be interpreted as bigoted by many people who aren't their vote base. We all know this type, although the level of their conservatism and nationalism may vary. \n\nJust to give examples of the first group because they can be a bit hard to spot, in the US, the Democratic party has so many influential Jews. It also speaks for the Black and immigrant voter. In the UK, Labor party has a lot of non-English influence and gets the Muslim, Black vote. In India, Brahmins and Jains had a lot of influence in the Congress party.

O son of Kuntƒ´, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.**  \n.  \n.  \n**PURPORT**  \n.  \nMaterial sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure? In the Padma PurƒÅ·πáa it is said:  \n.  \nramante yogino \'nante satyƒÅnanda-cid-ƒÅtmani  \niti rƒÅma-padenƒÅsau para·πÅ brahmƒÅbhidhƒ´yate  \n.  \n"The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as RƒÅma."  \n.  \nIn the ≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam also it is said:  \n.  \nnƒÅya·πÅ deho deha-bhƒÅjƒÅ·πÅ n·πõ-loke  \nka·π£·π≠ƒÅn kƒÅmƒÅn arhate vi·∏ç-bhajƒÅ·πÅ ye  \ntapo divya·πÅ putrakƒÅ yena sattva·πÅ  \n≈õuddhyed yasmƒÅd brahma-saukhya·πÅ tv anantam.  \n.  \n"My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters \\[hogs\\]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss." (BhƒÅg. 5.5.1)  \n.  \nTherefore, those who are true yogƒ´s or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : How one can make best use of the Human form of life ?**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2npgalf5bmy51.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b446f5fb0ca20376ffb7977994a6092cd502770f\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'js8p6b'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/js8p6b/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is522/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Let's talk about firecrackers"<br />Body: "Firecrackers are a fire hazard. Dangerous, and sometimes unpredictable. \nI believe the conversation about crackers starts and often ends whilst talking about religion, festivals and environment. \n\nI'd like to start a discussion about their safety and how hazardous they can be. \n\nMy suggestions are the following: \n\n- Manufacturing: There should be a special licence to manufacture firecrackers. It should require companies to rigorously test their products randomly in order to ascertain the quality of manufacturing and percentage of defects. \nOften crackers that are supposed to be safe burst spontaneously. I've seen it happen with chakris and anars. \n\n\n\n- Supply chain: Currently there's no track of who makes, sells or purchases firecrackers. If some accident happens because the cracker didn't behave like it should've, there's no accountability on anyone's part. This needs to change. \n\n\n\n- Age limit. Children should not be around firecrackers. It's reckless to have kids play with dangerous substances that can cause severe burn accidents. I believe the age limit should be 15. Kids below 15 shouldn't be allowed to or encouraged to play with firecrackers. \n\n\n\n- Safety: There should be designated areas for bursting crackers. Bursting them in densely populated areas, around combustible vehicles and by unsupervised people is incredibly dangerous. It's waiting for a huge hazard. Remember, our cities aren't well planned. In case of a fire, there are many areas where a firetruck cannot even reach. \nSo again, it's a huge risk doing such dangerous activities in heavily populated areas surrounded by things that can catch fire. \n\n\n\n- Permission: Firecrackers for random occasions and whenever one wants in the middle of the roads where people are traveling is again, a very dangerous practice and a disaster waiting to happen. \n\n\n\n- Quality: Crackers don't need to be this bad. A decent level of quality control would make burning and enjoying firecrackers a lot less damaging. \n\n\n\nConclusion: My suggestion is that firecrackers should be a sophisticated event done in large open grounds or stadiums where professionals burst good quality crackers and people can enjoy from the safety of the stands as an audience. \n\n\nFirecrackers can be a beautiful and fun experience for everyone. Biggest thing in this would be that everyone watching and experiencing it would be doing to voluntarily. \n\n\nNo more worrying about sick family members, or elders with heart conditions or pets or general health."<br />Author: 'shermitt'  id: 'js75fr'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/js75fr/lets_talk_about_firecrackers/</li>

Transcript'<br />Body: 'This is a transcript of certain parts of [Justice Chandrachud\'s lecture to Harvard students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb2rGLYeGbc). J. Chandrachud is himself a Harvard alumni, has been a lawyer and a law teacher. He is set to become CJI in 2022. \n\n# JUDICIAL DISSENT\n\nI remember my dissent in the Romila Thapar case in 2018. I said, "**Individuals who assert causes which may be unpopular to the echelons of power are yet entitled to the freedoms which are guaranteed by the Constitution. Dissent is a symbol of a vibrant democracy and voices in opposition cannot be muzzled by persecuting those who take up unpopular cases.**\n\n"While we may all disagree on how to express our dissent there is an agreement implicit in our constitutional framework which acknowledges the importance of dissent . Therefore as a form of government democracy must accept that there will always be those that disagree with the views of others and will express their disagreement. The expression of dissenting opinion must not be seen as a hindrance to policy but rather its criticism from which one can learn to make better well informed decisions."\n\n\\[..\\] There are not many more constitutional goals that can be placed higher than taking care of people at the margins.\n\n\\[With regards to\\] Judicial dissent, there is a slightly different consideration at play. Judicial dissent, unlike individual dissent, does not often arise from a difference in one\'s political viewpoint from the majority. Rather the basis of most judicial dissent is disagreement with an interpretation of law between different judges. So in many ways **judicial dissent can be a cause of simple intellectual disagreement as opposed to individual dissent about ground realities or political realities.**\n\nHowever the value ascribed to judicial dissent is often tied  to the nature of the case where it occurs, and the larger socio-political issues in society surrounding the case. Judicial dissent no longer remains an intellectual disagreement with the interpretation of law. But **its a disagreement about the most fundamental principles of the constitution and our democracy, and how we envision, as judges, our society going forward should take us.**\n\n# JUSTICE IS SELF-EXPRESSION\n\n\\[...\\] I\'ve been on the bench of the SC for 4 years and I have delivered dissents in 7 very crucial constitutional cases.\n\n\\[...\\] If one looks at the nature of the cases where you have had dissents in India, its not hard to see that dissents have arisen in the crucial cases which affect constitutional democracy, the rule of law as we judges envision. and I think the power of judicial dissent is extraordinarily important. Unlike the civil law tradition where all judges speak with one voice, the common law tradition which we follow...\n\n**I think the heart of judging, the core of judging, is that its an expression of yourself.** I think if you ask me what I\'ve learned in the last 20 years is that its a form of self-expression about what you consider to be a just society for the future. **So when a judge dissents, you are giving expression to some fundamental values of the constitution which are embodied in your heart.** and I believe if you don\'t have judicial dissent then you know the judges (heart?/staff?) would not be true to its own conscience.\n\n# SABARIMALA AND ESSENTIAL RELIGIOUS PRACTICES\n\n\\[...\\] For the international audience, I\'m not going to really defend my judgement because its obviously been the two viewpoints in a critical issues like this. This custom in a temple said that women between 10 and 50 would not be allowed to enter the temple, because that was stated to be the menstruating age. The reason for that is the deity is considered to be celibate and therefore the presence of a women would affect the celibate nature of the deity. That\'s the belief that\'s the custom, which we of course respect as human beings as judges but that has nothing to do with the constitutional question.\n\nNow India has... We struck down that and we said even a custom is subject to constitutional values and constitutional rights. And therefore **there is nothing in the religious sphere which is really private because religion is essentially has a position in the public space of the nation.** So we said **even a religious custom is amenable to constitutional control.** And India has a long history of temple entry movements. Because not merely women in this case but Dalits, untouchables were excluded from temples.\n\nYou can\'t understand the constitution by construing it merely as a document for transfer of political power from colonial regime to a homegrown regime. It was also a movement for transformation, a transformation of society and therefore our constitution really reflects this very deep seated aspiration for transformation in Indian society.\n\nWe follow in SC what we call **the essential religious practices test, which is that the SC will decide, court will decide what is essential to the religion.** and i criticized that test. **I suggested that you must have a different test that is the anti exclusion principle which means really that even if a practice is essential to a religion, if it perpetrates exclusion of a certain class of society then that exclusion is amenable to constitutional standards.** \n\nSo we have an article that bans untouchability in Constitution. And **I said to exclude a woman who is in the menstruating age group from praying in a temple really makes her into the position of an untouchable involving basic issues of pollution and purity** and therefore infringes Constitutional safeguards.\n\nInterestingly there was a beautifully written dissent in that by my colleague **Justice Indu Malhotra. \\[...\\] She said that the court would ban only pernicious or oppressive practice and not every religious practice. But that was where we really parted company.** The majority said there is constitutional control which can be exercised over fundamental aspects of religion insofar religion has an interface with the constitution.'<br />Author: 'thirumbux2'  id: 'jrgrd0'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jrgrd0/j_chandrachud_justice_is_a_form_of_selfexpression/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Our system needs to improve'<br />Body: 'In 1990, in Panchkula, there was a 14 year old, promising Tennis player named Ruchika Girhotra and an IG, SPS Rathore.\n\nGiven that he was a police officer, and NOT a tennis player, he was somehow found to be suitable to be the president of Haryana Lawn Tennis Association.\nAs SPS Rathore thought himself to be a God, he had illegally encroached Government land, and built a tennis court in his house. What powerful govt servant are you, if you don\'t bend a few rules? On 11th Aug 1990, Rathore told Ruchika\'s father, she needs special training.\nThe next day, thinking about a bright future, she went to the Tennis court with her friend. Rathore called them both to his office and then sent her friend out.\n\nThis is where the tragedy, begun. Rathore, a 50 year old man, grabbed the 14 year old, and started molesting her.\nRuchika tried to push him off. But he refused to relent. By this time, her friend had returned &amp; she started shouting. In this confusion, Ruchika ran out.\n\nFirst, being scared, they didn\'t tell anyone. But Rathore tried calling them again to his office again.\nThis is when Ruchika told her parents. And they filed a complaint. Things went horribly south after that: Rathore paid some guys to protest in front of Ruchika\'s house\n\nNo FIR was filed, in spite of the investigating officer indicting Rathore. The govt buried the case.\nMeanwhile, two months later, Ruchika was expelled from her school, because of "non payment" of fees. When Ruchika tried to pay, the school refused to accept. False cases were filed against Ruchika\'s father, brother and mother. Remember her friend , who was also the sole witness. More than 10 cases were filed against her.\n\nHer father was wrongly accused of corruption and removed from his job. And whenever Ruchika went out, she was abused by people who were hired by Rathore. Ruchika\'s father was falsely accused of theft and sacked. Worst was to follow. Her Brother Ashu was picked up 5 times from the police and tortured. Once he was even paraded in front of his house, in handcuffs to pressurized Ruchika to withdraw the case.\n\nFinally giving up on ideas of justice and freedom, Ruchika took her life in Dec 1993. Rathore, then threatened to kill her brother, in police custody, if Ruchika\'s parents didn\'t sign on the fabricated post mortem report. They did.\n\nThe Govt closed her file within a week. What happened to the m*ons*er that was SS Rathore? Nothing. In fact he was promoted.\n\nNo charge-sheet was filed. He was even recommended for the police medal by Om Prakash Chautala. Her father, somehow in 1997, moved to the Punjab High court. The court ordered a CBI inquiry, but Rathore continued to be the police chief. CBI tried to impose abetment to suicide case on Rathore. The judge dismissed it offhand, citing "There was no Harassment".\n\nThe hearings went on for 12 years. Then in 2009, he was sentenced to six months in Prison. He got bail, within 2 minutes of the sentence. Finally in 2016, 26 years after Ruchika\'s tragic death, SC sentenced Rathore to six months in prison considering "his age". It took 26 years, 65 Adjournments and more than 500 hearings, to punish a m*ons*er.\n\nA m*ons*er who molested a kid who trusted him. A m*ons*er who destroyed the life of her family. A monster who grossly misused the power bestowed upon him, to not only get away with murder, but be rewarded for it. And he was not even punished. It was more like a slap on the wrist with a feather.\nThis is the justice system of India. A system which totally favors the ones in power.\n\nA justice system where govt employees think they can do anything, because they can and they do get away. A justice system which does not hang a SS Rathore, doesn\'t deserve to exist.\nImagine the power vested in a police officer, who could molest a 14 year old, arrest her brother on trumped up charges, get her father dismissed from his work, file defamation cases against the sole witness, get her father suspended from his job, with zero consequence.\nRemember the incident, where Ruchika was thrown out of school for non payment of fees\n\nThere was one more child who had also not paid her fees and paid after Ruchika. She was allowed to continue. You know who it was? It was a girl named Priyanjali Rathore. Daughter of SS Rathore and remember the judge who dismissed the abetment of Suicide case against Rathore, citing no evidence.\nHe had a property dispute with Ruchika\'s dad. If Mistrials had a pantheon of Gods, Ruchika\'s case would be the main deity. And that judge would be the Pope.\nThat judge, Justice Kathuria, still continues and was the chief of Haryana Consumer Redressal forum.\n\nIf our selection mechanism puts such people in positions of unparalleled power, who will misuse it for their benefit, maybe it\'s time to change the mechanism.\nIt took us 26 years, to punish a child molester, that too with a sentence of six months. SIX f***ing months\n\nA crime that usually entails life imprisonment, in many countries, along with loss of everything. In India, we rewarded that guy with a police medal for "exemplary" service\nIt is the power of Punishment alone, when exercised impartially, in proportion to guilt, and irrespective of whether it is the King\'s son or his enemy, that protects the world.'<br />Author: 'golu-rbt'  id: 'jr0gmk'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jr0gmk/our_system_needs_to_improve/</li>

A person in brahma-yoga, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : Why a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person loses his taste for material sense pleasure ?

      <li>Title::: 'The difference between an Indian origin American politician and an Italian origin Indian politician.'<br />Body: "To all those Indians who are projecting Kamala Harris as someone who Indians should be proud of, I have a question. What do you think of this Italian lady Sonia Gandhi who moved to India 50 years ago, married an Indian and mothered two children who are Indian citizens and worked for the people of India even after facing a great deal of personal loss and tragedies. She lived as an Indian for 50 years, learned Indian language and culture and is an Indian citizen. Still of many of us refer to her as Italian, Italian agent etc. Now imagine Americans referring to Harris as Indian agent, spy etc. How would it look?  I can't understand this hypocrisy amongst us. A person who is an American by birth (whose mother voluntarily gave up Indian citizenship) is someone who we should be proud of (and we should be proud of Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai too although they gave up Indian citizenship to become Americans). We are trying to prove the Indianness of these American citizens on one hand and on the other trying to prove the Italianness of an Indian citizen. A woman who voluntarily choose India and became an Indian through her life and work is someone who we should be ashamed of and suspicious of. I see Sonia Gandhi as more Indian than Harris or Nadella or Pichai but the hatred towards her is a marker of the level of xenophobia among Indians (who cry about white xenophobia while obscuring the same amongst themselves)."<br />Author: 'lebowhiskey'  id: 'jqd1o4'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jqd1o4/the_difference_between_an_indian_origin_american/</li>

For example, many regions suffer from dire water shortages, there aren't enough public infrastructure like trains, hospitals, courts, etc, pollution is alarming in many parts of the country, institutions don't have proper checks and balances, as a result people don't trust the system. \n\n**Is this because India is economically poor? Is it because centuries of colonization is still taking its toll? Or is it because of the Indian culture that doesn't emphasize on doing things in an organized manner?** \n\nReason 1 and 2 are related, where the problem is external. It assumes that if India reaches a certain income threshold and certain past injustices are rectified, India will be a completely different country where things are run smoothly. \n\nReason 3 says that the problem is more internal, that even if the external condition is favorable, India will still be a mess because Indians are messy. I tend to agree with this reason. By the way it's not just an Indian problem. If we look at world geography, regions in hot climate zone like South America, Southern Europe and Southeast Asia seem to be poorly governed compared to North America, Northern Europe and Northeast Asia."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'jqcqw1'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jqcqw1/why_is_india_such_a_mess/</li>

In the context of this partnership, the US government‚Äôs development agency\xa0**USAID**\xa0has negotiated cooperation agreements with the\xa0**Indian ministry of finance**. **One of these has the declared goal to push back the use of cash in favor of digital payments in India and globally.**\n\nOn November 8, Indian prime minster Narendra Modi\xa0announced that\xa0the two largest denominations of banknotes could not be used for payments any more with almost immediate effect. Owners could only recoup their value by putting them into a bank account before the short grace period expired. The amount of cash that banks were allowed to pay out to individual customers was severely restricted. Almost half of Indians have no bank account and many do not even have a bank nearby. The economy is largely cash based. Thus, a severe shortage of cash ensued. Those who suffered the most were the poorest and most vulnerable. They had additional difficulty earning their meager living in the informal sector or paying for essential goods and services like food, medicine or hospitals.\xa0[Chaos and fraud reigned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-04/money-laundering-networks-thrive-amid-india-s-cash-ban-chaos)\xa0well into December.\n\n**Four weeks earlier**\n\nNot even four weeks before this assault on Indians,\xa0**USAID**\xa0had announced the establishment of ‚Äû***Catalyst***: Inclusive Cashless Payment Partnership‚Äú, with the goal of effecting a quantum leap in cashless payment in India. The\xa0[press statement](https://www.usaid.gov/india/press-releases/oct-14-2016-usaid-launches-catalyst-drive-cashless-payments-india)\xa0of October 14 says that\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0‚Äúmarks\xa0the next phase of partnership between USAID and Ministry of Finance to facilitate universal financial inclusion‚Äù. The statement does not show up in the\xa0[list of press statements](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases)\xa0on the website of USAID (anymore?). Not even filtering statements with the word ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù would bring it up. To find it, you seem to have to know it exists, or stumble upon it in a web search. Indeed, this and other statements, which seemed rather boring before,\xa0have become a lot more interesting and revealing after November 8.\n\nReading the statements with hindsight it becomes obvious, that\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0and the partnership of USAID and the Indian Ministry of Finance, from which\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0originated, are little more than fronts which were used to be able to prepare the assault on all Indians using cash without arousing undue suspicion. Even the name\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0sounds a lot more ominous, once you know what happened on November 9.\n\n*Catalyst‚Äôs*\xa0Director of Project Incubation is Alok Gupta, who used to be Chief Operating Officer of the\xa0*World Resources Institute*\xa0in Washington, which has USAID as one of its main sponsors. He was also an original member of the team that developed\xa0*Aadhaar*, the Big-Brother-like biometric identification system.\n\nAccording to a\xa0[report](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/usaid-finance-ministry-bring-catalyst-for-digital-payments-in-india/articleshow/54854337.cms)\xa0of the Indian\xa0*Economic Times*, USAID has committed to finance Catalyst for three years. Amounts are kept secret.\n\nBadal Malick was Vice President of India‚Äôs most important online marketplace Snapdeal, before he was appointed as CEO of\xa0*Catalyst*.\xa0He commented:\n\n&gt;*Catalyst‚Äôs mission is to solve*\xa0***multiple coordination problems***\xa0*that have blocked the penetration of digital payments among merchants and low-income consumers. We look forward to creating a sustainable and*\xa0***replicable model****. (‚Ä¶)\xa0While there has been (‚Ä¶) a concerted push for digital payments by the government, there is still a last mile gap when it comes to merchant acceptance and coordination issues. We want to bring a*\xa0***holistic ecosystem approach***\xa0*to these problems.*\n\n**Ten months earlier**\n\nThe multiple coordination problem and the cash-ecosystem-issue that Malick mentions had been analysed in a report that USAID commissioned in 2015 and presented in\xa0**January 2016**, in the context of the anti-cash partnership with the Indian Ministry of Finance. The\xa0[press release](https://www.usaid.gov/india/press-releases/jan-20-2016-beyond-cash-identifies-barriers-and-solutions-digital-inclusive-economy-india)\xa0on this presentation is also not in\xa0USAID‚Äôs list of press statements (anymore?).\xa0The title of the study was ‚Äú[Beyond Cash](https://www.globalinnovationexchange.org/beyond-cash)‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúMerchants, like consumers, are\xa0**trapped in cash ecosystems**, which inhibits their interest‚Äù in digital payment it said in the report. Since few traders accept digital payments, few consumers have an interest in it, and since few consumers use digital payments, few traders have an interest in it. Given that banks and payment providers charge fees for equipment to use or even just try out digital payment, a strong external impulse is needed to achieve a level of card penetration that would create mutual interest of both sides in digital payment options.\n\nIt turned out in November that the declared ‚Äúholistic ecosystem approach‚Äù to create this impulse consisted in destroying the cash-ecosystem for a limited time and to slowly dry it up later, by limiting the availability of cash from banks for individual customers. Since the assault had to be a surprise to achieve its full catalyst-results, the published\xa0*Beyond-Cash*\\-Study and the protagonists of\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0could not openly describe their plans. They used a clever trick to disguise them and still be able to openly do the necessary preparations, even including expert hearings. They consistently talked of a regional field experiment that they were ostensibly planning.\n\n‚ÄúThe goal is to take\xa0**one city**\xa0and\xa0**increase the digital payments 10x**\xa0in six to 12 months,‚Äù\xa0[said Malick](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/54854337.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst)\xa0less than four weeks before most cash was abolished in the whole of India. To not be limited in their preparation on one city alone, the\xa0*Beyond-Cash*\\-report and\xa0*Catalyst*\xa0kept talking about a range of regions they were examining, ostensibly\xa0in order to later decide which was the best city or region for the field experiment. Only in November did it became clear that the whole of India should be the guinea-pig-region for a global drive to end the reliance on cash. Reading a statement of\xa0Ambassador Jonathan Addleton, USAID Mission Director to India, with hindsight, it becomes clear that he\xa0stealthily announced that, when he said four weeks earlier:\n\n&gt;*India is at the forefront of*\xa0***global efforts to digitize economies***\xa0*and create new economic opportunities that extend to hard-to-reach populations. Catalyst will support these efforts by focusing on the challenge of making everyday purchases cashless.*\n\n**Veterans of the war on cash in action**\n\nWho are the institutions behind this decisive attack on cash? Upon the presentation of the\xa0*Beyond-Cash*\\-report, USAID declared: ‚ÄúOver 35 key Indian, American and international organizations have partnered with the Ministry of Finance and USAID on this initiative.‚Äù On the website catalyst.org one can see that they are mostly IT- and payment service providers who want to make money from digital payments or from the associated data generation on users. Many are veterans of,what a high-ranking official of Deutsche Bundesbank called the ‚Äúwar of interested financial institutions on cash‚Äù ([in German](http://norberthaering.de/de/27-german/news/609-nrw-zusammenfassung)). They include the Better Than Cash Alliance, the Gates Foundation (Microsoft), Omidyar Network (eBay), the Dell Foundation Mastercard, Visa, Metlife Foundation.\n\n**The Better Than Cash Alliance**\n\nThe\xa0[Better Than Cash Alliance](https://www.betterthancash.org/), which includes USAID as a member, is mentioned first for a reason. It was founded in 2012 to push back cash on a global scale. The secretariat is housed at the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDP) in New York, which might have its reason in the fact that this rather poor small UN-organization was glad to have the Gates-Foundation in one of the two preceding years and the Master-Card-Foundation in the other as its\xa0[most generous donor](http://www.dgvn.de/un-im-ueberblick/deutschlands-beitraege-zur-finanzierung-des-un-systems/ii-ausgewaehlte-un-fonds-und-programme/ii01-uncdf/)s.\n\nThe members of the Alliance are large US-Institutions which would benefit most from pushing back cash, i.e. credit card companies Mastercard and Visa, and also some US-institutions whose names come up a lot in books on the history of the United States intelligence services, namely Ford Foundation and USAID. A prominent member is also the Gates-Foundation. Omidyar Network of eBay-founder Pierre Omidyar and Citi are important contributors. Almost all of these are individually also partners in the current USAID-India-Initiative to end the reliance on cash in India and beyond. The initiative and the Catalyst-program seem little more than an extended Better Than Cash Alliance, augmented by Indian and Asian organizations with a strong business interest in a much decreased use of cash.\n\n**Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs IMF-Chicago Boy**\n\nThe partnership to prepare the temporary banning of most cash in India coincides roughly with the tenure of\xa0**Raghuram Rajan**\xa0at the helm of Reserve Bank of India from September 2013 to September 2016. Rajan (53) had been, and is now again, economics professor at the University of Chicago. From 2003 to 2006 he had been Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. (This is a cv-item he shares with another important warrior against cash, Ken Rogoff.) He is a member of the\xa0[Group of Thirty](http://www.group30.org/), a rather\xa0[shady organization](http://norberthaering.de/de/27-german/news/477-draghi-and-g30), where high ranking representatives of the world major commercial financial institutions share their thoughts and plans with the presidents of the most important central banks, behind closed doors and with no minutes taken. It becomes increasingly clear that the Group of Thirty is one of the major coordination centers of the worldwide war on cash. Its membership includes other key warriers like Rogoff, Larry Summers and others.\n\nRaghuram Rajan has ample reason to expect to climb further to\xa0the highest rungs in international finance and thus had good reason to play Washington‚Äôs game well.\xa0[He already was](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/raghuram.rajan/about-me.html)\xa0a President of the American Finance Association and inaugural recipient of its Fisher-Black-Prize in financial research. He won the handsomely endowed prizes of Infosys for economic research and of Deutsche Bank for financial economics as well as the\xa0*Financial Times*/Goldman Sachs Prize for best economics book. He was declared Indian of the year by NASSCOM and Central Banker of the year by\xa0*Euromoney*\xa0and by\xa0*The Banker*. He is considered a possible successor of Christine Lagard at the helm of the IMF, but can certainly also expect to be considered for other top\xa0jobs in international finance.\n\nAs a Central Bank Governor, Rajan was liked and well respected by the financial sector, but very much disliked by company people from the real (producing) sector, despite his penchant for deregulation and economic reform. The main reason was the restrictive monetary policy he introduced and staunchly defended. After he\xa0[was viciously criticized](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/business/head-of-indias-central-bank-says-he-will-step-down.html)\xa0from the ranks of the governing party, he declared in June that he would not seek a second term in September. Later he told the New York Times that he had wanted to stay on, but not for a whole term, and that premier Modi would not have that. A former commerce and law Minister, Mr. Swamy,\xa0[said](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/business/head-of-indias-central-bank-says-he-will-step-down.html)\xa0on the occasion of Rajan‚Äôs \xa0departure that it would make Indian industrialists happy:\n\n&gt;*I certainly wanted him out, and I made it clear to the prime minister, as clear as possible. (‚Ä¶) His audience was essentially Western, and his audience in India was transplanted westernized society. People used to come in delegations to my house to urge me to do something about it.*\n\n**A disaster that had to happen**\n\nIf Rajan was involved in the preparation of this assault to declare most of Indians‚Äô banknotes illegal ‚Äì and there should be little doubt about that, given his personal and institutional links and the importance of Reserve Bank of India in the provision of cash ‚Äì he had ample reason to stay in the background. After all, it cannot have surprised anyone closely involved in the matter, that this would result in chaos and extreme hardship, especially for the majority of poor and rural Indians, who were flagged as the supposed beneficiaries of the badly misnamed ‚Äúfinancial-inclusion‚Äù-drive. USAID and partners had analysed the situation extensively and found in the\xa0*Beyond-Cash*\\-report that 97% of transactions were done in cash and that only 55% of Indians had a bank account. They also found that even of these bank accounts, ‚Äúonly 29% have been used in the last three months‚Äú.\n\nAll this was well known and made it a certainty that suddenly abolishing most cash would cause severe and even existential problems to many small traders and producers and to many people in remote regions without banks. When it did, it became obvious, how false the promise of financial inclusion by digitalization of payments and pushing back cash has always been. There simply is no other means of payment that can compete with cash in allowing everybody with such low hurdles to participate in the market economy.\n\nHowever, for Visa, Mastercard and the other payment service providers, who were not affected by these existential problems of the huddled masses, the assault on cash will most likely turn out a big success, ‚Äúscaling up‚Äù digital payments in the ‚Äútrial region‚Äù. After this chaos and with all the losses that they had to suffer, all business people who can afford it, are likely to make sure they can accept digital payments in the future. And consumers, who are restricted in the amount of cash they can get from banks now, will use opportunities to pay with cards, much to the benefit of Visa, Mastercard and the other members of the extended Better Than Cash\xa0Alliance.\n\n**Why Washington is waging a global war on cash**\n\nThe business interests of the US-companies that dominate the gobal IT business and payment systems are an important reason for the zeal of the US-government in its push to reduce cash use worldwide, but it is not the only one and might not be the most important one. Another motive is surveillance power that goes with increased use of digital payment. US-intelligence organizations and IT-companies together can survey all international payments done through banks and can monitor most of the general stream of digital data. Financial data tends to be the most important and valuable.\n\nEven more importantly, the status of the dollar as the worlds currency of reference and the dominance of US companies in international finance provide the US government with tremendous power over all participants in the formal non-cash financial system. It can make everybody conform to American law rather than to their local or international rules. German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has recently run a chilling story describing how that works ([German](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/deutscher-auf-usa-terrorliste-wegen-exporten-nach-iran-14552747.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2)). Employees of a Geran factoring firm doing completely legal business with Iran were put on a US terror list, which meant that they were shut off most of the financial system and even some logistics companies would not transport their furniture any more. A major German bank was forced to fire several employees upon US request, who had not done anything improper or unlawful.\n\nThere are many more such examples. Every internationally active bank can be blackmailed by the US government into following their orders, since revoking their license to do business in the US or in dollars basically amounts to shutting them down. Just think about Deutsche Bank, which had to negotiate with the US treasury for months whether they would have to pay a fne of 14 billion dollars and most likely go broke, or\xa0[get away with seven billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-23/deutsche-bank-to-settle-u-s-mortgage-probe-for-7-2-billion)\xa0and survive. If you have the power to bankrupt the largest banks even of large countries, you have power over their governments, too. This power through dominance over the financial system and the associated data is already there. The less cash there is in use, the more extensive and secure it is, as the use of cash is a major avenue for evading this power.'<br />Author: 'locksmithrenegade'  id: 'jq72nf'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/jq72nf/demonetisation_came_from_outside_india/</li>
