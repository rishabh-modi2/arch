      <li>Title::: 'Wtf am i doing with my life?'<br />Body: "I'm a 22 year old guy who has absolutely no clue about what im doing with my life in terms of my career, everything seems so bleak at the moment. After 12th I decided to do pursue BMM because the field seemed intresting and different compared to other degrees and despite my father who didn't really like the my choice initially ( He wanted me to pursue CA instead) but I convinced him somehow and he allowed me to pursue it since I seemed happy. \n\nFast forward 3 years later I realised how wrong I was, the course is nice but unless you live in tier 1 city there's not really much you can do because of limited opportunities and scope isn't that great, plus I also went through some personal stuff that affected alot on my academics and I graduated with a shitty grade. I wanted to pursue a postgraduate course but I found out that I cannot really apply anywhere decent because of my terrible marks. I felt absolutely hopeless and felt like I have ruined my career completely, later on my father suggested me to apply for 3 years LLB 2 years ago. \n\nSince I really didn't see any other options and i wanted to continue studying I decided to go for it, gave an entrance and got admission into a decent college. But later on I realised how much I hate studying Law and don't really understand that much about it, ended up getting a few KTs in the first year itself because I gave up trying to study and ended up with a drop. Though i managed to clear my KTs and got fresh admission into second year but i still hate every aspect this course and I feel it's just not for me. Because of this I feel very depressed and lost in life and I have no idea what's my future going to be like. Also my father is gonna retire next year and since he is the only earning member in our family might go through a financial crutch. Most of my friends are going abroad for higher studies or getting decent jobs by now and I'm still stuck wondering wtf I'm even doing in the first place. \nWould really appreciate any kind of help or advice."<br />Author: 'wanderer_himura'  id: 'kdrlqd'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kdrlqd/wtf_am_i_doing_with_my_life/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indira Gandhi saved India from the menace of Khalistan'<br />Body: 'She was the only person who saved India from the Khalistanis (which had an enormous amount of support in Punjab).\n\nThe Jan Sangh was allied with the SAD. The SAD at first allowed the Nirankari Sikhs their freedom of Religion and then shifted its stance against the Nirankaris. Jan Sangh was blinded by its own lalalland of Dharmic Unity to ever protest the ever increasing Sikh Radicalism in Punjab and stand up for the Nirankaris. \n\nIndira Gandhi helped the Nirankaris in this crucial time. The Nirankarks were excommunicated from the Sikh community by the Akal Takth. Nirankaris were attacked by extremists with a vast amount of support from many people in Punjab. The INC stood its ground and maintained that Nirankaris had their right to religion. Jan Sangh was nowhere to be seen. Bhrindanwale meanwhile led an attack on the Chief of Nirankaris and Fauja Singh (Babbar Khalsa) came from the other side to kill the chief of the Nirankaris. \n\nThe speculation of the whole "Indira made Bhindranwale" is patently false. It is designed by modern day BJP supporters to deflect blame from the Sikh Extremists to the INC. No one "makes" a radical. Especially a person who was opposed to the Nirankaris (whom the government was allegedly protecting) right from the start.\n\nIt was only Indira Gandhi who had the guts to call a spade a spade. She went on to flush the Terrorists from the Golden Temple and paid for this with her life. \n\n\nIndira Gandhi had a lot of faults,however Punjabi Hindus owe her A LOT. Had it not been for her,they would have have suffered a LOT.'<br />Author: 'bruhnowhat_8910'  id: 'kdoizn'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kdoizn/indira_gandhi_saved_india_from_the_menace_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is cold-pressed oil?'<br />Body: ' **Cold-pressed** oil is a clean environment-friendly technique to produce oil from nuts &amp; seeds. \n\nThe nuts &amp; seeds are pressed between the two heavy metal blocks, thereby the oil is released. \n\nThe first press released oil is called virgin cold-pressed oil\n\nThereafter the residue called cake is pressed to extract more oil. During the process, it is ensured that the temperature does not rise beyond 40 degrees Celsius. Hence the oil is produced in a room temperature condition, resulting in no loss of nutrients. The produced oil is rich in flavor &amp; nutrients best suitable for consumption &amp; application. \n\nThe biggest drawback of the cold pressing is that it gives a very low yield making oils expensive as compared to 21st century invented methods like solvent extraction, C02 extraction that produces a high yield, etc. \n\nFor making the best cold-pressed oil, it is important to use quality seed, right pressing, and right storage. \n\nHere at[SNAANA](https://www.snaana.com/index.php?route=common/home), we use the same traditional [cold-pressing](https://www.snaana.com/cold-pressed-oils) technique only to produce the oils. \n\n**We make** \n\n* Almond Oil\n* Coconut oil \n* Gotu kola oil\n* Mustard oil\n* Hemp Seed oil \n* Apricot oil\n* Kalonji oil\n* And much more. \n\nThe seeds are sourced directly from the farmers to ensure a healthy &amp; quality rich produce. Eat **Healthy – Apply Healthy**\n\nFor more details on benefits and uses of different oil make a visit us at[snaana.com](https://www.snaana.com/index.php?route=common/home)\n\nSNAANA invested in the set up of its own cold pressing unit only to ensure a healthy unadulterated produce to the consumer.\n\n\\#Say\\_no\\_to\\_refined\\_oils\n\n\\#Say\\_no\\_to\\_cosmetic\\_grade\\_oils\n\n\\#Say\\_yes\\_to\\_cold\\_pressed\\_oils'<br />Author: 'snaana_'  id: 'kdk3s4'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kdk3s4/what_is_coldpressed_oil/</li>

India will no longer have shortage of doctors, may have surplus doctors by 2024.'<br />Body: " \n\nThere is no denying that there is some shortage of doctors in India.\n\nCurrent govt has taken drastic steps to deal with the issue.\n\nOnly 300 medical colleges opened from 1950 to 2010 and govt opened 250 additional colleges in just next 10 years. PG: UG seat ratio was always less than 0.5. Which created huge shortage of specialist doctors. Now PG:UG seat ratio is 0.8 ,means nearly all the students who pass from a batch have PG seat available for them without worrying too much about entrance exams.\n\nGovt is going to create 120,000 MBBS seats by 2024 and 1L PG seats by the same time.  8 years back MBBS seats were 55k and PG seats were only 22K. Previous govt did not take any steps to create new colleges and invest in healthcare. There are many places where people die because doctor was not available. \n\nThese numbers are huge and mind boggling. But this means that medicine will not remain as a high earning branch in India.\n\nThis also shows that what BJP promises, it delivers (It was a part of BJP's manifesto)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-KLg-lDnMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-KLg-lDnMU)"<br />Author: 'indianbangalorianhp'  id: 'kdhm2o'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kdhm2o/india_on_path_to_become_largest_producer_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Intersectionality: Yogi Adityanath and Transgenders in India. (How Indian PseudoLiberals love showing off their illiberal side)'<br />Body: "I came across this article that popped up on my Firefox recommended articles:\n\n#[What Is Deadnaming, and How to Avoid It](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-deadnaming-and-how-to-avoid-it-1845802589?utm_source=pocket-newtab-intl-en)\n\nThe article first talks about such incidents and describes what 'deadnaming' is - referring to someone (in this case, trans people) by their birth names/pronouns that they have relinquished. The basic idea is that people have a right to determine their own identity - which is fine and makes sense.\n\nThe article then goes overboard as expected, with alarmist hyperbole about how referring to someone by former names has an impact on their health and well-being, and making it out to be on-par with violations of the Geneva Convention. So let's ignore that for now.\n\nThe truth is much more simple and straightforward - it's simply rude, offensive, and obnoxious. It impacts people the same way all rude and obnoxious behavior impacts people - it makes them angry, sad, or upset.\n\n#Enter Yogi.\n\nYogi Adityanath forsook his birth name, gave up familial ties, gave up property, left the possibility of marriage and children, and dedicated his life to something beyond himself. He has his own views and perception of the world, shaped by decades of working on inter-community relations, animal-welfare, social causes, infrastructure development, and more. I'm guessing nobody will agree with him on 100% of all issues, because no two people agree on 100% of anything, but if his track record is anything to go by, he's done a pretty great job overall. No riots in Gorakhpur for decades since he came to power there. Excellent attendance in Parliament, with high participation and deep involvement in multiple issues regarding his constituency and country - from defense, to fertilizers, to electricity, to women's issues.\n\nYogi Adityanath (and BJP as a whole) has done a lot towards increasing acceptance and mainstreaming of Transpeople in U.P., and India overall - more, perhaps, than almost any individual before him in India. Education, Jobs, Identification, Rights, and plenty more - with a measurable impact on the ground.\n\nBut instead of talking about any of this, our PseudoLiberals (ClosetCommunists) are busy deadnaming him at every turn, referring to him in a disparaging manner, using his birth name deliberately, with every intention of being offensive and edgy, out of raw butthurt and malice.\n\nIt would be sad... if it wasn't so hilarious. The amount of seething venom they have against a simple man - with no personal possessions, no wealth, no family, no corruption, no nepotism, who runs animal-shelters, speaks *and acts* in support of trans rights, eschews caste-politics, all because he wears saffron and isn't apologetic about his religion - and how little of a fuck he gives.\n\nWhat's interesting is how *revealing* it is, about their lack of ideological scruples and principles. They have no problem supporting rank communalists, casteists, bigots, anti-LGBT people, islamists, goons, gangsters, and idiots, so long as they conform to certain prerequisites. The fact is, they never really gave a single shit about trans people, or animal-welfare, or victims of communal violence - they only support these 'causes' if and when they're convenient.\n\nWhenever you see one of these specimens, talk to them about based Yogiji and watch their tears, and snarling, and howling that follows. It's hilarious and epic."<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'kcvktz'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kcvktz/intersectionality_yogi_adityanath_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Brexit deal in question, Morocco recognized Israel, and the story of Zine Ben Ali'<br />Body: 'Welcome to another edition of the Geopolitics thread, where we discuss the latest news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India - please share stories that caught your attention in the comments. Here are some stories to start the conversation: \n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [UK-EU continue to discuss Brexit deal](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/13/946045446/u-k-and-eu-will-keep-negotiating-as-brexit-deadline-looms)\n\nAs the deadline for the UK to exit its transitional period and become fully separate from the EU nears (Dec 31, cannot be extended), both sides have been engaged in heavy negotiations for a trade deal without success. Sticking points have included fishing rights (critical for the French), fair competition rules and mechanisms for resolving trade disputes. If no deal is reached, UK-EU trade would default to WTO rules, where the EU has significant tariff and non-tariff barriers. The UK government has supposedly asked pharmacies and grocery stores to stock up on 6 months of supplies - the island nation largely imports both.\n\n2. [Major hack of US government revealed](https://news.yahoo.com/us-looking-possible-treasury-department-204337089.html)\n\nA major hack of several US agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce Departments, was revealed to have been conducted by unspecified state actors, most likely Russia. The hackers are believed to have infiltrated the Microsoft Office suite used for emails, and have obtained the ability to read those emails. The hack is currently under investigation but is believed to have been going on for months before being discovered. Ironically, the hackers are believed to have used stolen cybersecurity software for their operation.\n\n3. [Germany to enter strict Christmas lockdown](https://apnews.com/article/angela-merkel-coronavirus-pandemic-berlin-germany-europe-01bbfd5514c7db218ae39c3feffba742)\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a sweeping new lockdown over Germany as cases and deaths from COVID-19 continued to surge. The lockdown effectively closes all dining establishments, limits church attendance, bans firecracker sales, and makes all schooling online until Jan 10. The government plans to compensate businesses through a new round of relief funds amounting to over €11 bn. At the same time, many have wondered why Germany has not approved a vaccine, even as other Western countries including the US and UK have done so.\n\n4. [Morocco recognizes Israel](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/10/945033413/morocco-becomes-latest-arab-country-to-normalize-ties-with-israel)\n\nIn what is becoming a weekly affair and possibly outgoing US President Donald Trump\'s biggest foreign policy achievement, the West African kingdom of Morocco moved to recognize and establish formal diplomatic relations with Israel, becoming the fourth Arab nation to do so this year, after the UAE, Bahrain, and Sudan. In return, the US has become one of the few countries in the world to recognize Morocco\'s sovereignty over the Western Sahara, a sparsely-populated former Spanish possession that claims independence and is supported by Algeria. Separately, Israel and Bhutan moved to establish formal ties in a meeting of their ambassadors in New Delhi.\n\n5. [Iranian journalist, found guilty of inciting violence, executed](https://nypost.com/2020/12/12/iranian-activist-journalist-executed-for-inciting-protests/)\n\nIran executed journalist Ruhollah Zam, a dissident who ran anti-government news on the encrypted messaging app Telegram and lived in exile in France. Zam, 47, was lured back to Iran in a secret operation by the IRGC after being accused to inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the Islamic regime that runs the country in 2017 and 2018. He was executed by hanging, prompting France to issue a protest and European businessmen to back out of a planned business summit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Zine Ben Ali\n\nLast week, we looked at Libya\'s former dictator, Gaddafi, who was overthrown during the Arab Spring through western military intervention but left a failed state and an ISIS haven behind. Indeed, the so-called Arab Spring was a failure in every country except the one where it started: the Tunisia, the small Mediterranean country that was once home to the great Kingdom of Carthage, Rome\'s main Mediterranean rival. The deposed dictator, in that case, was Zine Ben Ali.\n\nBorn in 1936 in what was then a French colony, Ali spent his early years fighting French rule, but after being imprisoned, gave it up for a career in the armed forces. In 1958, he joined the newly-formed Tunisian Army after France granted the country independence the year before. Ali quickly rose through both military and diplomatic ranks, becoming Director of National Security as well as a cabinet minister and eventually Prime Minister under President Bourguiba, himself a dictator. In 1987, when Bourguiba was rendered unable to govern due to medical reasons, Ben Ali declared himself president in a bloodless coup, a day that Ben Ali declared "New Era Day" and a national holiday. \n\nAlthough he initially pushed to democratize the country\'s politics and limit the power of the president, he soon went back to the undemocratic system than Tunisians were subject to since independence. In 1989, the first time presidential elections were held since 1974, he won as the only candidate on the ballot, and his party won 100% of parliamentary seats as well. In subsequent years, he continued to win elections either unopposed or with margins of over 90%, stifling the press and limiting his opponents\' ability to contest and campaign. \n\nAs President, Ali liberalized the economy, with the country averaging 5% annual growth largely on the back of tourism. However, political freedom was limited, with arbitrary arrests and police brutality being common. And yet, protests remained limited as Ben Ali did improve the standard of living - until December 2010, when anger over widespread unemployment spilled over into violence, and the Arab Spring was born. In panic, he ordered a violent crackdown and dissolved the government to declare martial law. However, the military had lost confidence in him and refused to obey. \n\nIn January 2011, the military allowed him and his family to fly out of the country before its airspace was closed, and he was eventually granted asylum in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (the same city where a lot of Pakistani politicians were exiled). He was tried in absentia by the new government of Tunisia for personal corruption and sentenced to decades in jail. He denied those charges and refused to return to the country to face his sentence. He died of prostate cancer in 2019 and was buried in Medina, never returning to his home country. \n\nIn the general scheme of African dictators, Ali could be argued as being one of the more benign ones - although political freedom was limited, there were no widespread killings or persecution, no Islamization of society, and strong economic growth. And yet, he underlined the difficulty of the Arab world in developing democratic institutions, reducing democracy to conducting farcical elections.\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'kcpot0'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kcpot0/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_brexit/</li>

Someone who'll have his back, someone who'll be by his side through thick and thin, someone who'll assuage his concerns. My mother didn't do what she ought to have. As much as she hurt us I can't sever ties with her. She worked tirelessly to ensure a decent upbringing for me. That stress took a toll on her wellbeing and she did what she shouldn't have. As a result they separated.\n\nMy father's alone and would be more than happy to remarry. But ignorant me doesn't know how to help him. This crippling helplessness, his smileless face, wrinkling hands and the shudder when his future daunts him don't let me sleep. \n\nPlease help me help make his life sweeter.

You can't establish a proper judicial system in such poor places...."<br />Body: "I was watching dhruv rathee to see the opposing take on yogi adityanath's encounters. He makes pretty good points that sometimes innocents will be killed in encounters and the solution is to increase police and judiciary. However I get the feeling he's not lived in small town UP and was speaking from someone who lived in south bombay or south delhi. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is because UP's per capita income is $600 - $700 which is bottom tier in the world, like I said on par with south sudan which fought a bloody civil war for last 7 years. This shows if u visit UP u'll see its disgustingly poor (I grew up there). Now nobody will blame the gov for extra judicial killings in South Sudan right... Similarly when you have a region equally poor with bad law and order it seems quite ridiculous to compare it with first world systems of dealing with crime... Firstly who is going to pay for all this? His dad? In order to build a robust judicial + police system you need money. To get money you need investments. To get investments you need to improve law + order lol. See every country starts out with illegal judicial killings as they get richer the systems are able to take over and become robust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I speak to locals, even muslims they may hate yogi for his hindu-muslim stuff but even they praise the improvement in law and order.

The Atmanirbhar Bharat clarion call by Narendra Modi was been shining a light on indigenous technology created by brilliant minds in India to provide everyday solutions without having to rely on foreign manufacturers.\n\n**Pravaig Dynamics has unveiled its first electronic vehicle that promises a range of up to 500 kilometres.** The Tesla Model S promises a range of 402 miles per full charge which is 646 kilometres. The Indian EV, named Pravaig Extinction MK I, has an ironical name, takes a dig at the extinction of non-renewable fuel-powered cars that use petrol or diesel. **Design-wise, it looks like a mixture of a sensible sedan in the front while the back looks like a beefy SUV with flared out bumpers.**\n\nThe completely indigenously built in India electric vehicle is sure to step up the EV game in India and set up a market in the home country. **The electric car is expected to be available for purchase in 2021.** The range is one of the most astonishing features for the car yet. A 500-kilometres range is no joke for an EV with the Volkswagen ID.3 managing to scrape around 500 km range if you drive very carefully. Tesla’s Model S is the only big-name to have cracked the 500+ km range on a single full charge of the battery.\n\nOf the current cars available in India, the Hyundai Kona comes with a factory promise of 452 kilometres range on a single charge. The MG ZS can go as much as 340 kilometres on a single charge with work ongoing to upgrade the batteries to reach the coveted 500-kilometre range. **It seems like the Pravaig Extinction Mk I could be India's best hope of taking on the Tesla range of EVs.**\n\nBengaluru-based EV startup Pravaig Dynamics expects to sell around 2,500 of its newly unveiled luxury electric vehicle Extinction MK 1 every year. **The company has issued a statement revealing its plans to initially produce 2,500 units of the EV annual from next year.**\n\nSo can we answer them,stone to brick Tesla and the rest of the world?

      <li>Title::: "'Hinduism' is as bad --- maybe worse -- as any other religion."<br />Body: "'Hinduism' is used to be better religion and these 'assholes' are turning it into a monotheistic religion just like Christianity or Islam. You find statements like these all the time on the internet. The people who are writing these are either ignorant or too privilege to understand what the 'Hinduism' actually is.\n\n'Hinduism' is not better religion -- if you call it a religion because it is a just assortments of different castes --  compare to Christianity or Islam.\n\nLet me explain why?\n\nThe main purpose of religion is to provide a sense of community among its practitioners and In this field the 'Hinduism' has failed miserably.\n\nEvery religion derives its authority from certain religious texts. These texts were written by ancient intellectuals to control simple, primitive people. So, these texts have their flaws but one thing is common among both the Quran and the Bible. Both of these texts talk about **Equality** among practitioners. There is no such thing in 'Hinduism'.\n\nReligious texts exclude most of its practitioners ---- everyone who isn't Brahmin or Kshatriya and all women ---- to perform rituals, sacrifices and all other religious things. They also exclude them from reading/writing, so they can never know about this deceit.\n\nNow comes to second the thing 'Hinduism' is turned into is called Hindutva. Hindutva is not a religion, it is a political phenomenon. It has many tools like ram mandir, cow vigilantism, three talaq, love Jihad and many others. Hindutva parties use them to gain votes in elections. People support these things that is why Hindutva parties are in power.\n\nWhen you say that 'Hinduism' used to better, you are no different from a Muslim moderate  --- who thinks *Islam is a religion of peace (No,  It isn't. The Quran clearly says 'kill the infidels and nonbelievers'. )*  \\--- or christian apologists.\n\nIn the last I want to say that any religion has no place --- even if it provides a sense of community among believers because *we don't need a community based on superstitions* \\--- in modern scientific world."<br />Author: 'yaadash'  id: 'kc4xf8'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kc4xf8/hinduism_is_as_bad_maybe_worse_as_any_other/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'This is why CAPITALISM IS GOOD ,and capitalism will lead to development. India needs robust free trade-'<br />Body: " \n\nSo, I heard some of my fellow Indians are pro socialist. And I am here to state why capitalism is better than socialism **Both practically and morally.**\n\n* **Practical cases -** First of all credit for prosperity of west totally goes to their economic structure and idea of capitalizing on innovation . But to prove my case further I would take example of how capitalism triumphed and contributed to the development of our developing nation, India. I have also included examples of success of space, weapons' and automobile Industry in case of Europe and US.\n\n1. In India 2010 about 7.5% of population had access to internet, at this time most of broadband companies were regulated by government, however privet ISP also existed. This however changed when a privet enterprise named Reliance Jio entered India ISP market. At that time major companies like airtel, vodafone etc. were fighting over updating their voice call service and internet services provided were 2G and 3G. Jio ( to Win the competition) bought 4G in India this revolutionized the market. **As a result of Corporate capitalism, India has the cheapest internet in world $0.26 for 1GB (while US has $12 for 1GB) which ultimately benefited the people! INTERNET ACCES IN INDIA INCREASED FROM 7.5% IN 2010 TO 34% IN 2017 AND 50% IN 2020.** ***Privet company achieved what government wasn't able to. Overall privet ownership increased INNOVATION and capital flow.***\n2. In case of USA similar example can be given for ***Automobile industry. Due to the competition between corporation which lead to better innovation, SINCE IT IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THEIRPROFIT. USA became top most manufacturer of automobile, and 2*** ***nd*** ***highest consumer. Now US is leading the world in automobile industry, with 88% of their population owning permanent transportation method.*** similarly in UK 87% of population owns vehicles.\n3. another example of win for capitalism in India will be the health provider (privet health provider/Hospital company ) Narayana Health which set up NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA hospitals which decreased the coast of cardiac surgery by 5 times, and were in better conditions compared to government hospitals. ***Again, Privet company achieved what government wasn't able to .Overall privet ownership increased INNOVATION and capital flow.***\n4. 2 such more examples of Europe and US can be given when stating their role, In Space industry and weapons' Industry. -\n\n\\-&gt; **We all know about space x and how it surprisingly beat NASA, Similarly in Europe and India and Japan certain space agencies have contributed heavily to space research.**\n\n\\-&gt;***Australia, however wasn't able to capitalize on space industry. and hence haven't been able todo much for Global space exploration and Lags in global space race.***\n\n5. Similarly ***Western Europe*** and nations like ***USA and Canada*** have developed much in Weapons' Industry because they have privatized companies ( although heavily regulated, for security reasons). While nations like India, Japan, lag behind since they haven't yet capitalized/privatized on weapons' industry. ***THink about it now best of guns/ War machineries comes from privet industries! For example- heckler and Koch, Dassault, Electric dynamics, Raytheon etc.***\n\n\\-&gt; In a stark contrast the strict labor laws *(something that the global left demands)* are still present in India, **Which were set up by the socialist govt. and are yet to be removed , are hindering the development of labor intensive industries.**\n\n6. Now we all know what happened in Venezuela, (for someone who doesn't, or is skeptical) this video sums it up -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32F\\_MH-A8Wc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32F_MH-A8Wc)\n\n* **Moral reasons -** So the basic reason why socialism is morally wrong is ***It gives complete control of both state and economy to the government.*** This is obviously very unhealthy for any free society.\n\nAnd last but not the least the 2 most obvious cause of failure of socialism are that 1.***People don't have the incentive to work hard. 2. People find it hard to capitalize on their ideas and thus SOCIALISM DESTROYES INNOVATION.***"<br />Author: 'rolfmone'  id: 'kc4stq'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kc4stq/this_is_why_capitalism_is_good_and_capitalism/</li>

It witnessed major activity during the period 2010 to  2014, accounting for \\~ 70% of the organized new age residential supply  of the city, with average quarterly launch of \\~ 7,500 units and average  quarterly absorption of \\~ 6,500 units. During this phase the capital  value exhibited growth at a CAGR of \\~ 12%,” says Jeevesh Sabharwal, Director, Horizon Construction.\n\nAfter this 5-year period, the region  witnessed a slump in real estate activity with dip in launches as well  as absorption. The effect got more pronounced post demonetization, i.e.  in the years 2017 &amp; 2018, wherein the average quarterly new launches  dipped to \\~ 500 units. During this period, most of the absorption has  been in the form of secondary purchases, while absorptions even in  primary markets were either with projects closer to completion or with  developers of repute.\n\n“With regards to capital values, the  residential segment has not returned much over the last few years.

      <li>Title::: 'It is IMPERATIVE that Upper Castes do Massive Outreach to SC/ST Castes. Unity is Very Necessary. Break India is Real, and it can Happen Organically without External Support!'<br />Body: "I say this as a non hindu but someone who loves my country. I think India is a very fragile country, very loosely connected, most countries are connected by a strong shared cultural heritage or end up in civil wars as is the case in Mid East, Africa... India has miraculously avoided this fate though there have been strong attempts made. The only way to **guarantee** India unity, is caste unity in hindus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia is divided on the following\n\n* Caste\n* Language\n* Religion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel religious unity trumps language unity, DMK has tried for decades to make TN atheist and repel hinduism, but now is being forced to reconcile with hindi, even in his last days Karunanidhi bragged about his daughter knowing hindi and told hindi kavitas himself. This means While breakage on language is possible it won't happen unless there is breakage in religion, religion binds the people together an many decades of assault on it have failed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**However**, this can change very quickly. There is **major major** anger in a lot of dalits (just google dalit youtube videos you will see), and they want a marxist violent revolution to bring equality, like the french evolution. There are **v strong**  forces in play here, external forces just amplify them, but don't be fooled these are mostly homegrown. People hate the fact their ancestors were forced to sift through shit and are still forced to do that. A very simple fragment in this and there can be mass chaos in India. Otoh, if Caste unity happens, virtually no force can divide India, as the percentage control will be too strong and the divisive forces will be weakened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich is why I believe it is very important for upper castes to do outreach. Forget about removing reservations for a few years, please, I know merit is better, but a bloody civil war will be horrific, and trust me SC have it very very bad at times (I'm not talking about your urban friends, but the ones in villages). If we show good will gesture and genuinely try to understand their problems help them, integrate with them, it will destroy all attempts by others to beat India. And you will learn a lot from them as well. You can do simple things like actually going and listening to them (the poor ones). What problems they have. Have your kids socialize with their kids via cricket/soccer etc like when you do a charity visit (trust me this goes a long long way (it enforces the belief that discrimination is practiced by a few and is not widespread, they for instance will have a very hard time hating you if you genuinely help them out and your kids and their kids get along as equals), and make sure your kids don't sprout bullshit while playing sports). Become **good** friends with them, invite them to events in your community etc. Another good initiative will be build really awesome temples in dalit areas so other caste communities from outside want to willingly visit the temple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am genuinely worried about India cause the forces are very strong and upper castes are kind of apathetic to them."<br />Author: 'teresenahopaaega'  id: 'kb0adn'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kb0adn/it_is_imperative_that_upper_castes_do_massive/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A case in favour of Sadashivrao Bhau'<br />Body: 'I plan on making a few posts such as this one, before I make a post on the Third Battle of Panipat.\n\n\n\n\nOn the 3rd of August, 1730, the younger brother of Bajirao Ballal, Chimaji Appa was blessed with a son. This boy, he named Sadashivrao. Though, in time, he would earn the nickname Bhau. The young boy\'s father died when he was a mere ten years old. His education and nurturing being taken care of by his aunt Kashibai and his grandmother Radhabhai.\n\n\n\nAt the age of 16, in 1746, he undertook his first campaign. The campaign continued till May 1747 mostly in the western Karnatak region. In January 1747 he won his first battle at Ajra, south of Kolhapur. All together 36 parganas were captured in this campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, Sadashivrao Bhau, would be made the Dewan of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao otherwise known as Nana Saheb. He successfully led the Battle of Udgir which weakened the Nizam of Hyderabad. It was here that Bhau first used a more European method of war, employing his Gardis and artillery to good use and winning the day. Thus, he grew suspicious of the old geurilla way of war and promoted a European model of pitched battles. \n\n\nA few words must be said about these early successes and the effect they had on a man of Bhau\'s temperament and his estimation of his own capabilities. Grant Duff draws a good picture of the young triumphant yet amateur Bhau in these words :\n\n\n" The natural violence of Bhau\'s temper was increased by the family jealousy he had experienced, and the factious intrigues to which it gave rise. His pride was augmented by his extraordinary good fortune in the late campaign, and the spirit of military enthusiasm so dangerous in a general without experience, took complete possession of his mind. Success had inspired him with a blind confidence, which salutary reverses in a humble sphere would in all probability have amended."\n\n\n\nAdded to this mental disposition, was the material factor of war, which was again unfortunately inadequate for the task Bhau was meant to accomplish.\n\n\n\nIn term of soldiers and equipment, he had been supplied with 10,000 of Peshwa\'s own household troops 12,000 of the subordinate chiefs, 8000 disciplined Gardis and 20,000 Pindaris (freebooting raiders). He was provided 8,184 cannon balls out of 19,000 required. 160 maubds of lead and 800 maunds of gunpowder, 99,150 flints for muskets, and an inadequate quantity of 65 sheets against 2000 requisitioned, of European paper for charging the muskets.\n\n\n\nThe Peshwa expected a Maratha army to supply itself with plunder and therefore gave Bhau a mere Rs. 1,88,000 while the monthly expenses exceeded 5 to 6 lakhs. Added to the miserable condition of his supplies and the unsatisfactory composition of his troops, Bhau had one more problem facing him.\n\n\n\nBhau, had too little time to prepare. He had never been to North India, didn\'t know its climate and people or culture. He had with him many families who wished to visit the sacred sites in North India. He didn\'t have boats to ford the rivers in the North. The Marathas fought the Afghans in winter when the Afghans are at their finest, instead of the summer when the climate would have sapped the Durrani of his vitality, this too happened due to delays.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I will say this, yes, there are many aspects that led to the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat, but Bhau is not solely responsible for this. The choice of picking a general lay in the hand of Nana Saheb, who even against the advice of his court should have ocjed Raghunath Rao. The only reason why Bhau was sent to the North instead of Raghunath, who was experienced in the North having led two successful expeditions there, was because the success of Maratha campaigns was judged in monetary terms, and in thus realm, Bhau overtook Raghunath who had brought debt to the Empire. This added with the fact that the army, it\'s supplies and composition also lay in the hands of the court, which also, wasn\'t optimal.\n\n\n\nI\'m open to any discussions in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nSources : Military History of India by Sir Jadunath Sarkar\n\n\n"Marathas and Panipat" - Hari Ram Gupta\n\n\n\n"Military System of The Marathas" by Surendra Nath Sen\n\n\n\n"Ahwal-e-Jang-e-Bhau-va-Ahmad Shah Durrani" by Pandit Kashiraj, Dewan of Shuja-ud-Daulah.'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'  id: 'kay4bx'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kay4bx/a_case_in_favour_of_sadashivrao_bhau/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What does destruction of temple leads to?'<br />Body: "We all know that thousands of temples were destroyed by invaders. We need to understand that those invaders not only wanted to establish supremacy of their religion but they also wanted to destroy the places where common people gather and build community. Temples were the hub of information sharing. That's where our ancestors gathered and decided what's good for them, their villages &amp; community. As they met daily, they knew each other's grievances and helped whenever they can. They read shastra regularly and debated on various issues. They became better version of themselves and build things for society. They had morals, ethics &amp; courage of conviction. We had so many temples because they were part of our daily life and source of knowledge.\n\nGradually we lost all of that. We stopped going to temple regularly. We stopped reading our scriptures. After that how can we expect to save our culture/dharma. My mother used to say that most important temple in any ones life is the nearest one because that's where you start your dharma, that's where you protect your dharma and that's where dharma protects you. That's where you learn, grow and become a better compassionate kind person.\n\nSo my brothers and sisters it is my humble request to you all, please start going to temple - DAILY. Build our community irrespective of cast. Help each other. Donate to the local temples. Keep atleast one almera full of shartra in the temple (story books for children). Start pathshala in the evening. Be inclusive and transparent in working of temple. That's how we will be able to revive ourselves and able to protect our indian philosophy and culture. Give only 15 mins of your day and see how we get back on our feet in a decade.\n\nPS : Please also remember to keep political parties (neta) away from our temples. Why do you ask? Because in a democratic secular multi party system, no party can represent one single religion. Our first priority should be to read more and help each other. No matter who someone vote for, if you meet them in a temple daily, they are your brothers and sisters. Have patience. Political benefits will come in due time. Like getting fodder when we grow wheat.\n\nIf you still have doubt, please look around. Muslims, Christian, Sikh and jains - they all go to their place of worship regularly. That's how they have very strong community.

      <li>Title::: 'Explaining the new Farm laws as best as i can'<br />Body: '#  Explaining the new Farms law (As best as I can to my knowledge)\n\nThe  new farm bill was created by the BJP government to promote more buyers  for Farm products so the Indian agriculture industry can move forward  which seems to be stuck in a cataclysm. It includes three acts Farmers\'  Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the  Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and  Farm Services Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.\n\nExactly how does this bill tend to achieve that? Well, the government has made plenty of changes.\n\n1. Farmers  will be able to sell their crops outside of APMC yards / Mandis.  Farmers will have no restriction on where they want to sell their  product. This bill is designed to expand the areas for farmers to trade,  with this the Farmers can trade anywhere in the country in "any place  of production, collection, aggregation". It also gives farmers access to  inter-state and intra-state trading. But it does not make APMC yards /  Mandis absolute as they will be functioning as always.\n\n2.  Prohibits State government to collect any market fees from trades,  farmers or traders that happens outside of govt designated Mandis. This  is done to make trades easier and cheaper.\n\n3.  It provides a legal framework for the contracts that are made between  farmer/farmers and the buyer/buyers/buying firm. The government has  taken care to ensure that farmers will not be taken advantage of as  such,\n\ni. The farmer may only enter  the agreement if it includes the time of supply, quality, grade,  standards, price, and such other matters; and it includes the terms  related to supply of farm       services\n\nii.  The length of an agreement is a minimum of one crop cycle / one  production cycle and up to 5 years maximum unless farmer and buyer agree  on extending the length\n\niii. Both  parties can adopt a quality and grade standard and the buyer can check  on crops during their cycle to ensure no problems arise on the day of  deliver\n\niv. **The buyer will guarantee to pay for the produce** which is mentioned in the  agreement\n\n* The buyer will agree to pay a sum of a guaranteed amount to the farmer\n* An  additional bonus or premium can be also specified to ensure the best  value to the farmer and such price may be linked to the prevailing  prices of APMC yard / Mandis, or any other suitable benchmark prices\n\nv.  The responsibility of picking up the trade at the designated time at  the trade gate and                                              make  necessary arrangements for picking up the produce falls on the buyer\n\nvi. The payment to farmers should be done\n\n* **In  most cases, the farmers should be paid at the time when the buyer is  accepting the produce and issue a receipt to farmers unless**\n* In  cases Where it relates to seed production, in which 2/3 of payment  should be done when the agriculture produce is handed over and 1/3 of  payment should be done after         certification or within 30 days of  trade.\n\nvii. The  agreement cannot be made to modify the land or erect a structure /  change structures within it unless it is agreed upon and the structure  is removed by the buyer by the end of the agreement. If the structure is  not removed by end of the agreement than the structure will be owned by  the farmer\n\n4.  It makes a conciliation board to help with any disputes that arise  within the agreement, the board will have the power to settle the  dispute with the agreement of both parties. And if the dispute is not  solved by the said board then the case will be taken to Sub-District  Magistrate in which the Sub-District Magistrate shall have the authority  of the civil court. This process is done so the farmers may not end up  in the long battles in courts which usually drags for months if not  year, and in this time the produce can go array.\n\n5. **It removes the limit added to cold storage for storing cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils**,  by removing it from essential accomidities except under ‘extraordinary  circumstances’. Rather than base the stock limit on the type of produce  it tries to restrict it based on its increase in produce’s price.\n\n# What are the concerns of farmers and people?\n\n1. The MSP will be affected by removing the role of APMC yard / mandis.\n\n* **False  as the bill does not make APMC yard / mandis absolute and merely gives  an option to farmers to trade their produce outside the mandis**  and also do electronic trades. Since doing this will not have any  charges on trades by the government. The farmers can sell in APMC if  they wish to. The mandis are removed so the farmers can sell anywhere  they wish. This bill also removes the restrictions on inter-state trades  and pushes the idea of ‘One India, One Agri’.\n\n2. The government will not buy crops or will not buy crops under MSP\n\n* The government mainly buys wheat, paddy, and pulses. **This bill mentions nothing of as such about govt not buying the wheat, paddy, and pulses as they used to buy** and it is likely government will not stop doing it since they need these crops for various schemes they run.\n\n3. The government wishes to trade land to big corporations\n\n* False,  as this bill bars any modification to land in its agreements. And  farmers will always have the choice to not trade with these corporations  if they chose to.\n\n4. The states that have abrogated the APMC act has degraded their agriculture industry\n\n* Contrary  to popular belief many states allow contractual farming and have made  changes to APMC. The example that many people give to point out faults  in allowing these changes is Bihar. As even Rahul Gandhi tweeted how  Bihar was ruined due to these changes. But let’s see some facts.\n\nT**his is the graph that shows the agriculture growth of states** (courtesy to [thePrint.com](https://theprint.com/))-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tbfbaw6w4e461.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a0edbd8ac3c4e87dad8d59ee510901c08df0a94\n\nCourtesy of thePrint.com\n\n* As  you can see Bihar is doing better than the national average in spite  that Bihar has less land for cultivation as compared to let’s say  Punjab. Yes, the Bihar’s farmer earns less as of now but they used to  earn even lesser and now their industry is growing at an exponential  rate as compared to Punjab’s growth which is regressing. The cycle of  wheat -paddy – wheat is what is destroying many state\'s land and  agricultural produce. This law tries to push a variety of crops for  production.\n\n5. Farmers will not receive their due.\n\n* **As  mentioned above the law covers the basic right of farmers, which is to  ensure they get considerable profits from their produce, and it has  given many guidelines to ensure that**. Like Farmers getting the  price of their produce at the exact time of selling it, unless it is  seed production in which they will receive 2/3 of their price on trade  and 1/3 within 30 days at most.\n\n6. Removing the limit on storage will increase the price for wheat, etc\n\n* The  bill states that the crops for which the storage limit has been removed  are food items including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible  oilseeds, and oils. The government has also ensured that the  restrictions will be imposed but not pre-determined from start but will  be imposed based on the increase in the price of crops. **So,  if the price of a certain crop for example if the price of Potato  increases by a lot then the government will impose restrictions on its  storage so more potatoes will be sold in the market.**\n\n7.  The government is taking the right of farmers to go to civil court in  case if a dispute arises between buyer refuses from conditions of  agreement made\n\n* The  government has not taken the right of Farmers but the government has  given the power of the civil court to SDMs since it can take very long  to reach the case in courts and SDMs will act and hold the authority of  the civil court in their decrees to settle the disputes. This will  ensure that farmers will receive justice in due time.\n\nSourcess - [EGazzete.nic.in](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2020/222040.pdf)\n\n[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_farm_reforms_2020)'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'kaj2nx'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kaj2nx/explaining_the_new_farm_laws_as_best_as_i_can/</li>

      <li>Title::: "TIL that Veer Savarkar's younger brother was also killed in the Brahmin massacre carried out to avenge the death of Gandhi by Godse. The death toll is estimated to be over 5000, women raped, properties burnt."<br />Body: '&gt;The first use of state machinery and the guided mob were used in 1948 just after the assassination of Gandhi by Nathuram Godse. The orchestrated cold-blooded killings of Brahmins started in Maharashtra by the Congress workers and local Maratha who took the political advantage of the situation. Along with local Marathas, Jains and Lingayats too joined the mob and destroyed houses and factories owned by Chitpavan Brahmins.\n\n&gt;Addresses of Brahmin houses, shops and factories were pin-pointed and shared with the mob. Within the two hours of the death of Gandhi, planned and simultaneous attacks were unleashed on the Brahmins. The mob was provided with Kerosene canisters, rods, and machetes. Houses, shops, and factories were torched by throwing kerosene-soaked paper and cotton balls at them, women were raped and people were killed for no reason and Brahmins were forced to flee. The barbarity spanned across 300 districts of all 13 Talukas.\n\n&gt;The hatred was so intense that the properties of Veer Savarkar were destroyed by the perpetrators and his younger brother Veer Narayan Savarkar was killed by the mob by stone-pelting. The family, which fought for the independence of Hindus was destroyed by the same Hindus. Brahmins who were wealthy migrated to the US and the other countries whereas those who couldn’t afford their escape got located themselves in the different parts of India to save their coming generations.\n\n&gt;This massacre was equally intense as the 1984 massacre, but no Indian media ever talked about this. The incident was reported in many foreign newspapers, but Indian media, which was under the influence of then Congress government didn’t mention it.\n\n&gt;The unofficial number of deaths in this massacre is above 5000. Thousands of houses were torched in a single night. The voice and pain of those Brahmins were torched forever. They had to flee their own land, they had to leave their dreams behind. For the trillions of times, the death of Gandhi has been used by the Congress government for the votes, but the massacre of those poor Brahmins was never ever discussed. None of them ever got justice. Not a single rioter was sent to jail.\n\n&gt;Each year the death of Gandhi is mourned by all the political parties but not a single political leader dares to talk about this massacre because those massacred Chitpavan Brahmins were not a majority and a vote-bank which can help political parties to win elections.\n\nSome sources put the estimate of death toll at over 8000. In my opinion, this Brahmin massacre was the one which set the example for Congress for what to do if their politician is assassinated. After all, they went away scot free the first time, why not repeat the same in 1984?\n\nhttps://medium.com/@AdhiyajnaSharma/after-hundreds-of-years-of-freedom-struggle-india-got-her-independence-from-foreigners-in-563aeb7db7f7#:~:text=The%20unofficial%20number%20of%20deaths,to%20leave%20their%20dreams%20behind.\n\nhttps://www.hindupost.in/politics/while-gandhians-tag-godse-as-a-terrorist-lets-revisit-the-brahmin-genocide-of-1948/\n\nhttps://hindugenocide.com/political-crimes/1948-maharashtrian-brahmin-genocide-8000-killed/'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'kagkjy'<br />Score:245<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/kagkjy/til_that_veer_savarkars_younger_brother_was_also/</li>

The frown on the Principal’s forehead seems intensified by beads of perspiration. \xa0Now what! The boys stiffened. The class teacher too, seemed to be looking for a place to hide. Principal’s visits were rare, especially unannounced walks into grade ‘9th\xa0C’. Deepak paused sketching, now trying to hide the caricature under the desk, his abrupt movements making the paper slip and glide gently towards the front rows to our horror. Deepak was never caught. But the entire back bench, in which I sat, got punished that day. The principal chuckled silently at the caricature.\n\nIt turned out that the Principal was just looking for volunteers for a simple task. A call out for volunteers, from the high &amp; mighty, be it in school or later on in life, always caused some trepidation to creep in.\n\nWatching the first person being administered the vaccine in ‘The UK‘ evoked memories of that volunteer call. Did she volunteer or was she selected at random? What went through her mind, knowing that she was to be the first in the que! Relief? Gratitude? Anxiety on safety and side-effects or simply triumph of having been landed the chance ahead of billions?\n\nThen I realized that if it became a norm for every person on this earth to be vaccinated, given where I stood in the scheme of things, I would be lucky to find myself to be the 5 billion four hundred and tenth in line for the jab. What could I do, to move, say a few billions up the order?\n\nBefore even I could come to think of this, I am sure there is a whole industry of hustlers out there working on this problem for themselves. The high and mighty, the wealthy and the powerful, the VIPs and their fixers, liaison officers of a thousand CEOs, all trying to get jabbed on time.\n\nHow soon before ‘vaccinated’ becomes a status symbol? Would one get a badge upon being vaccinated? A badge catching more eye balls than a Mont Blanc pen, a Louis Vuitton, or even arrival in a Lamborghini for an event perhaps.\n\nPartying damsel: “Look at the minister’s wife flaunting her jab” \xa0\n\nHer boyfriend: “Hardly surprising! The minister threatened to pull down the coalition if he was not allotted a vaccine. Rumor has it that he applied for one, for one of his lady loves, but his wife was slyly informed by the party high command; you can imagine the rest.”\n\nWhat If the short supply persists, will it be long before the drug mafia gets interested in ‘running’ the vaccine. Perhaps a few Bollywood’s celebrities too would be arrested for being in possession of the Vaccine!\n\nHow do you think would governments, set protocols for their high &amp; mighty? I would have expected Her Majesty to be the first one to be inoculated in the UK, but perhaps things are not so simple after all.\n\nI guess Trump would be the best placed to lay his hands on one, but given his contempt for Covid, he would not be interested anyway. Back home, for sure Ambani and his ilk would already have been vaccinated by now.\n\nProcurement ministries and sundry wheeler dealers would be rubbing their hands in glee, this would be bigger than the ‘Spectrum auctions’ after all.\n\nWill the public get the same vaccine as the ministers and VIPs or like in case of all medicines the cheaper versions would be allocated for the public and a pre-frozen Pfizer vial would be specially imported for those in power? Foreign travel thankfully is forbidden, else everyone who matters would be rushing abroad on official tours, of course to take a shot.\n\nMatrimonial adverts could read something like…’Fair, beautiful bride wanted for MBA working in an MNC. No demands, interested families would need to arrange for ten sets of vaccinations’ … Or ‘Fair, beautiful inoculated bride wanted’.\xa0 Those not going through the matrimonial route, could of course propose with a vial instead of a ring.\n\nCliché – Henpecked husbands or should I say pin pricked spouses , please come home without a vaccine at your risk.\n\nAll is well that ends well.

For the romance of Socialism and Socialist policies, it has only lead to farmer suicides and nothing more.\n\nThe less money the famer has, it benefits the money lender, who mostly tends to be a political figure.\n\nThe less access the famer has to markets, and only has one mandi to sell produce in, it helps the Mandi Board, who's president is also a politician.\n\nAnd those in Lutyens, who know nothing about farming, want an issue to criticise the government.\n\nFor long farmer has been in speeches, but farmer's plight has only helped the politician.\n\nAn infrastructure for Contract farming only helps the farmer, who will need tools like MSP far less frequently.

      <li>Title::: 'Samrat Hemchandra "Vikramaditya" The Absolute Hindu Madlad'<br />Body: 'The early life of Hemchandra is not well known. But the following is the information I could gather. He was born a Bharadwaj or Gaur Brahmin, in the South West region of Delhi. Due to being born in a poor family, he spent his early life working as a tradesman. His rise to prominence came after the death of Sher Shah Suri, whose son, Islam Shah was a man absorbed in pleasure and luxury. \n\n\n\n\nDuring this period Hemu claimed the political ladder, going from tradesman to the superintendent of the market in Delhi, with experience of command under his belt and a contingent of troops under his command.\n\n\n\n\nHemu is subsequently said to have been appointed the Chief of Intelligence and Superintendent of Posts. Other sources also place him as a surveyor of the imperial kitchens. Islam Shah made Hemu a high ranking officer in recognition of his organisational and soldierly skills.\n\n\n\nHemu was then dispatched to monitor the movements of Humayun\'s half-brother, Kamran Mirza, in the neighbourhood of Mankot.\n\n\n\n\nIslam Shah died on 30 October 1553 and was succeeded by his 12-year-old son, Firoz Khan, who was killed within three days of his accession by his uncle, Adil Shah Suri. The new ruler was however more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than affairs of the state. But Hemu threw in his lot with Adil Shah and his military successes led him to being elevated to the position of Chief Minister and the general supervisor of the state. \n\n\n\nAccording to Abu\'l-Fazl, Hemu "undertook all appointments and dismissals, and the distribution of justice" in the Shah\'s court.\n\n\n\n\nHemchandra now commanded the respect of Afghan and Hindu troops and after chasing down the enemies of Adil Shah, from Malwa To Bengal, he earned their loyalty, as the only military mind after Sher Shah Suri who could hold his own on a battlefield for the Afghans and Hindus.\n\n\n\n\nHe would prove this to be true at the Battle of Tughlaqabad 1556. Without getting into the exhaustive prelude and context of the battle I\'ll focus on the battle itself. \n\n\n\nThe opposing sides had roughly the same numbers of men which was somewhere between 50,000 to 60,000 men. The Mughal commanders were the Governor of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan and Bairam Khan\'s best commander, Pir Muhammad Sharwani.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand was Hemchandra, with his 50,000 cavalry, 1000 elephants, 60 cannons and 500 Falconets.\n\n\n\n The Mughals were commanded by Tardi Beg in the centre with Iskandar Beg leading the left wing and Haidar Muhammad, the right. Abdullah Uzbeg commanded the vanguard which included in its ranks select Turki cavalry.\n\n\n\nThe Battle can be summed up in 3 phases. In the first phase, Hemu\'s right wing was engaged by the Mughal Vanguard and the Mughal Left wing. Reeling under pressure, the left wing began slowly being pushed back, while the Mughals pushed their advantage, but the fact that Hemu chose to allow the Mughals an advantage and allowed them to go after his left, hints to the fact that he wanted to take away from the Mughals their advantage in horse archers, which was what their vanguard and left wing was made up of.\n\n\n\n\nIn the second phase, Hemu sent forth his centre and left wing forces towards the Mughal centre, which included his best cavalry and elephants while holding a small guard of the elephants and guard cavalry as reserve. The Mughals lacked any horse archers to screen the attack and their Vangaurd and Left wing were so far afield that they could not be recalled, seeing this the soldiers and their commanders, panicked. Pressing their advantage, the Afghan and Hindu horsemen engaged in wholesale slaughter along the Mughal line, while their enemy tried to put up a resistance.\n\n\n\n\nIn the final phase, Hemchandra\'s reinforcements arrived, under Haji Khan from Alwar, and at this point he sent a force to rescue his left and himself charged with his guard at the Mughals, while Tardi Beg and Pir Muhammad Sharwani fled\n\n\n\nHemu, scored a decisive victory.\n\n\n\nAfter taking control of Delhi, Hem Chandra claimed royal status and assumed the title of Vikramaditya (or Bikramjit), an appellation used by a number of Hindu kings in India\'s ancient Vedic past. The name Vikramaditya, is historically a name adopted by a Hindu king who slew the Mlechhas. Though his reign was short lived, he secured his name in the galaxy of heroes who came to define the character and spirit of Hindu resistance to foreign occupation.'<br />Author: 'PushyamitraShunga1st'  id: 'k9rx91'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k9rx91/samrat_hemchandra_vikramaditya_the_absolute_hindu/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Farmer's Protest Backstory"<br />Body: "In june indian government proposes three ordinance regarding farming and how they plan to make it 'open market'. Now remember this was when corona was on peak and everything was shut down. The timing was perfect because they anticipated protest from public but they couldn't have been possible during shutdown. \n\nThe live telecast was stopped(never ever happened before for any bill) during voting for it. Later on members of parliament who were against it told that their demand for open voting was rejected. Possibility to form a separate committee to analyse these ordinances was rejected too and they were rushed by the sitting speaker.(In short a whole mess and opposite of what was supposed to be democratic)\n\nSo now ordinances are passed and they are bills/acts. Lockdown opens and farmers come together to protest against it. They blocked highways and trains. Hoping that someone (literally anyone from the govt) will come to listen to them.\n\nThey sat for 50+ days but rather then indulging in a dialogue with them govt decides to hault all the trains to punjab. Not a single media channel reported it. Giving rest of the india an impression that everything was good.\n\nIn the meantime tolls on road were not being paid. Trains were not running resulting in heavy loss in revenue to government(miss those 'ache din' when even for a day if this happened it was a breaking news). Government was expecting that it will die out in punjab itself but didn't. \n\nFamer union sent a notice to government a month before stating that if no one comes to listen to them, they'll march to delhi on 26-27 november and furthermore request to protest in ram leela madaan which was rejected. So yeah, this protest was not sudden it is well planned and democratic. Not a single public property was burnt or damaged by the protesters.\n\n\n(Side note- Due to stoppage of trains inflation sky rocketed in punjab eg- urea essential for farming which was sold for 300 a pack was being blacked for more than 3000. Farmers didn't block all the tracks. Government had alternative routes. But still they decided to transport goods to jammu and kashmir through flights rather than trains.)\n\nOn 26 November protesters begin their march to Delhi under the slogan 'Delhi Chalo'. So far in 50+ days of protest there was not a single case of violence or public property damage. \n\nIn the 50+ days protest no political leader from central government came to hear their concerns. Union leaders who went to delhi for the meeting were received by a cabinet secretary. No minister or a prominent leader felt the need to attend it. \n\nPunjab Haryana border is separated by Shambu barrier. Few kilometres from the protesters ground in punjab. To stop these protesters police had put up road dividers/blocks, multiple rows of barricades tied together with iron ropes, stationed multiple water canon vans on a flyover. Haryana C.M. on record advised haryana famers to not help protesters. \n\nIn total there were 4 major such barrier points. At 2 and 3 barrier they placed huge stones that were brought there by cranes. Sand trucks were lined up bumper to bumper. Infront of barricades barbed wires were put up. Barbed wires are illegal to put up around property/farm in uttar pradesh due to how badly they injure a living being. \n \nAt fourth barrier police dig up  the ground 6 to 10 feet  to stop protesters. Just imagine your clothes being dripping wet and driving an open tractor on highway in winters at night. Authorities literally did everything to stop the protesters from reaching Delhi. Hours before reaching Delhi, police asked permission from delhi government to use 9 stadiums as temporary jail. \n\nProtesters were treated as if they were coming from outside indian border. They were made feel like third class citizens of nation. The protester you see turning water canon off has been registered under ipc section 307(half murder)."<br />Author: 'Amanjot-Singh'  id: 'k9qrih'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k9qrih/farmers_protest_backstory/</li>

Highways/roadways/Railways are lifeline of any nation. Stopping the movement would only lead to economic and personal losses. Now, it could be an unpopular opinion, but I also feel that the people protesting should pay back whatever damage that has been caused by their protests. Currently during the farmer's protest , most of the highways connecting Delhi to it's neighbouring states are closed. You want to stop a highway, go ahead, but pay the govt whatever losses that has been caused when any highway is closed, this includes the toll which people would be paying while crossing otherwise(we can get estimate of number of vehicles crossing per hour). If you don't do that, the govt should have right to confiscate their properties.\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where a guy is travelling from a small village in punjab/UP to delhi for some emergency medical treatment. If he looses his life due to this disruption of movement, the people protesting should be charged with attempt to murder or some similar.

Hookups/FWB getting more common and normalized, love marriages getting more common than arranged ones etc. Well i'm an NRI but my family is quite conservative. But my peers are all Liberal minded, so my viewpoint maybe a tad bit skewed/mixed or odd for some people, but i can't actually change it. Its been subconsciously ingrained into me.\n\nI actually value chastity a lot and i don't think i can convince myself otherwise. Its impossible to find chaste girls in US, so i am not even looking at any girl in here, it was tempting back in my HS days when girls asked me out, but i didn't really like the whole concept back then and i feel glad i opted out lol. But i'm a little worried about finding one in India too considering how open, sex and the rest of that stuff are getting there. I totally acknowledge and respect that people have different interests. Some guys maybe fine with it , they can feel free to do what they like. Same way i don't feel anything wrong with a preference like that as i am a virgin myself. I don't get why people say that we must adjust and move on , its like society forcing their standards on us. Like whats really wrong in preferring a girl who's as experienced as me? Its like a sin to say that you want virgin girls.\n\nSimilarly i personally hate Hookups/FWB , i want a Long Term Relationship. It'd take me a bit to settle like 8-10 years more. But i honestly don't want to face a situation where i can't find a virgin girl for LTR/marriage like in US. The concept of an arranged marriage for me is like finding a girl, getting our parents approval and then dating each other for a while before we get married. I dont wanna go for a blunt proposal where i dont even know the girl. I want to first connect with her, then marry.\n\nI'd like an attractive girl who'd be my looksmatch and she should be a virgin. Thats it. I dont carry any other expectations like what she wears or does. I am not restrictive at all, she can do what she likes. And i dont adhere to the conventional 'women do all the household work' theory. I'd like a 50-50. Most girls here rated me an 8/10 , so i think i won't have issues in finding a date in any way.

All of a sudden there’s all this anti-India propaganda circulating on social media and it baffles me to see the urban youth fall for it without even wondering about the other side of the story. Most people don’t even know what the bill is. \n\nThey just read: police fire tear gas. Poor farmers. If you eat food, save our farmers. \n\nI just wanna scream at them: if you eat food and want to save our farmers, stop objecting the new bill. Embrace it since the bill will help farmers profit and enslave them from these corrupt middlemen. \n\nMy point here is, why am I not seeing more of these counter arguments make the rounds. \n\nThese guys have an army of people tagging, sharing and posting anti India content. \n\nWhere’s the pro-India army countering them? BJP needs good PR. Someone on here pointed out, we need journalists in the west talking about our perspective too. \n\nToronto Star is insanely biased and a piece of crap. How do people forget, Khalistanis in Canada bombed an Air India flight and to see Trudeau support them is extremely baffling. \n\nWhat’s worse is a Canadian federal party leader- Jagmeet Singh does not condemn or denounce the Khalistani leaders who were responsible for Canada’s biggest aviation attack. \n\nObviously, I want india to be one and our strength lied in our diversity and unity. But when these guys talk about speratism and spread anti India propaganda it makes in so angry and upset with the lack of counter arguments that need to be circulated to rescue our youth and others from being brainwashed into hating on India. \n\nSorry for my rant. \n\nAnd dear mods, happy to take this down if it interferes with your guidelines.'<br />Author: 'aquabe'  id: 'k8lx3f'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k8lx3f/farmer_protest_lack_of_counter_arguments_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Evidence about the benefits of native language education.'<br />Body: "I was reading old threads about NEP on this sub and some were claiming that there was no evidence to suggest that native language education was better, etc.\n\nI'm late to the discussion, but I'd like to point out that there exists research showing the benefits of teaching kids in their native languages.\n\nhttp://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/963701468771062355/pdf/multi-page.pdf\n\nStudy in Guatemala, where indigenous children (who don't speak the dominant language of Spanish natively) who were taught in their native language till grade 4, then after that, taught in the dominant Spanish, performed better than others who were exclusively taught in Spanish.\n\n&gt; Students of bilingual schools in Guatemalahave higher attendance and promotion rates and lower repetition and dropout rates. A very importantfinding is that bilingual students receive higher scores on all subject matters, including mastery of Spanish.\n\n---\n\nhttps://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000161121\n\nStudy in Mali, Papua New Guinea, Peru, and USA.\n\n&gt;  The  research  evidence  today  clearly  shows  that  using  the  learners’  mother  tongue  is  crucial to effective learning.  Indeed, some educationists have argued that the only countries likely to achieve EFA are those where the language of instruction  is  the  learners’ mother  tongue.  However,  the  prevalence  of  globalization  and  democratic  ideals  demonstrates  that  students  must  be  proficient in international and regional languages to gain access to wider society and to participate meaningfully in their world.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; The evidence is clear: mother-tongue-based bilingual education significantly enhances  the  learning  outcomes  of  students  from  minority  language  communities.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;Their overall academic achievement is superior to that of students in the monolingual second-language system. Their mathematics achievement is superior as well. Their achievement in the second language is at least as high as that of students in the monolingual second-language system.\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; Compared  with  education  systems  that  use  the  second  language  as  the medium of instruction, bilingual education is more cost effective since student learning improves signifi cantly.\n\nThis study also cites a huge number of sources itself.\n\nThe study also does warn that significant improvements will only be seen if the education imparted in the mother tongue is of decent quality. But in either case, the academic achievement of mother-tongue educated students will not be less than that of second-language education of equivalent quality.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, fears that teaching children in native languages in primary will hurt either their academic achievement, or their mastery of English, are completely unfounded. English skills of students in such systems are at least as good as those taught in English from Class 1, if not better in some cases."<br />Author: '67616e64206d61726120'  id: 'k8d8s9'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k8d8s9/evidence_about_the_benefits_of_native_language/</li>

      <li>Title::: "With storage allowed in the new Farm Reform, wouldn't the private players be able to control prices in some way?"<br />Body: "Until now, I broadly supported Farm Bill, but recently I have developed some doubts/apprehensions regarding it. I'd appreciate very much if anyone can answer these.\n\nIf the storage is allowed, then couldn't the private players be able to manipulate prices(I know there are limits to which a price can increase, after which storage would be illegal, but still)? One might argue that competition among private players will stop this from happening, but what about nondeliberate or unplanned cooperation happening between private players, out of their own desire for profit?\n\nExperts say that the reason for allowing storage is that during harvesting season, there is a glut in the market, so with no storage prices fall. But, even if there is storage, at some point those storages would be full, and then prices would drop, which would mean that in the next harvesting season, less farmers would produce that crop, which would mean that the most supply of that crop would depend upon the private players releasing their storage, which I fear they would postpone as long as they can, so that there is a shortfall of that crop in the market and the prices rise, and they can make as much profit?\n\nI am all against MSP - I think it encourages farmers to produce something which is not really needed and waste precious resources like water, land, fertilizers, and human labour. It also encourages much more people to be in the farming profession than it's needed; it also discourages crop diversification and entrepreneurship in farmers.\n\nI think the real problem is of poverty and unemployment rather than of farming. Yes, farming has a problem and that is that prices aren't allowed to go beyond a certain point, which is very bad for farmers. Govt. should do proper welfare like Universal Basic Income or Direct Benefit Transfers, rather than giving subsidies(fertilizer, water, electricity, MSP, etc.) - Pay for free instead of paying for doing something which is not needed! Having done that, now free markets should be allowed to reign and food prices should be allowed to increase infinitely.\n\nBut in the light of the doubt/apprehension I mentioned above, regarding Farm Bill, shouldn't a better thing to do, is to have govt. built and operate these storages while allowing markets to function and not control price in anyway? Separate selling to private players should be allowed bdw.\n\nThanks"<br />Author: 'manubhatt3'  id: 'k8an58'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k8an58/with_storage_allowed_in_the_new_farm_reform/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Cognitive dissonance : the key to understanding Someone like Rana Ayyub'<br />Body: 'Rana Ayyub an Islamist, recently posted her anger and pain on Babri masjid demolition and how she didn’t get the “justice”. As followers of persecuted Hindu dharma, we can justify that it was built on destroying a hindu mandir and it wasn’t even an important masjid. In fact, it was abanadoned for centuries by Muslims. Only when local hindus started to worship Rama Bhagwan in it in 1850, Muslims started to object.  Why the pain ? Why the sense of injustice when in the most poetic sense, it has been restored. They also support tearing down statues of American leaders with sketchy past but they won’t apply same logic on destruction of a masjid which is symbolic Of centuries of Hindu persecution.\n\nI think the answer lies in cognitive dissonance caused by it. Unlike leftist Islamic sympathizers, Rana Ayyub feels like a genuine Islamist. Someone who believes in all the words of Quran and almighty of her god. Imagine, Babri destructiion is a reminder to her of what they have conquered being taken back by indigenous people. A reminder that Islam failed to purge Hinduism. Hell, even the idol worshipping religion is thriving now. Reminder that she doesnt have Arabic or Turkish ancestry and her ancestors followed Ram and Krishna. Even some of fellow Muslims are infected by this Hinduism as they take part i. Hindu festivals And have colorful weddings, take part in singing. It is a reminder to her that the Caliphate is nothing more than a pipe dream and people are turning against hardcore Islam everyday.

      <li>Title::: 'Demands by the farmerunions and their repurcussions of what happens when you make it the legal right of farmers to sell 100% of farm produce at over 40% of respective international prices.'<br />Body: 'The protesting farmers\' unions have raised five common demands before the Union government.\n\nRepealing the three new farm laws is the first demand. Farmers\' unions say these laws are not in their favour and will promote privatisation of agriculture, thus benefiting hoarders and big corporate houses.\n\nThe second demand is to get a written assurance in the form of a Bill that minimum support price (MSP) and conventional food grain procurement system by the Centre will continue.\n\nThe third major demand is to scrap the Electricity (Amendment) Bill. Farmers\' unions say if this Bill becomes a law, they will lose the free electricity provision as it will promote privatisation of electricity and discontinuation of free power supplied to farmers in Punjab.\n\nThe fourth demand is about a provision under which farmers responsible for burning farm residue can be imprisoned for five years, besides imposition of a fine of up to Rs one crore. Farmers have demanded that this provision be scrapped too.\n\nThe fifth demand is about the release of farmers arrested on charges of burning paddy stubble in Punjab.\n\n13-point charter by some farmers\' unions\nThe common demands apart, BKU (Ekta Ugraha) and Left-affiliated farmers\' unions have presented a 13-point charter of demands to the government. These are:\n\n1. Repeal the three recent agriculture laws, besides the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020.\n2. Implement Universal Public Distribution System (PDS) throughout the country and include in it all essential food and non-food items of basic necessities.\n3. Implement the formula recommended by Swaminathan Commission to fix profitable MSPs for all crops.\n4. Legally ensure government procurement on MSPfor all crops.\n5. Also implement other pro-farmer recommendations of Swaminathan Commission.\n6. Roll back steps directed towards deregulating and decontrolling trade and commerce of farm produce in favour of big Indian and foreign traders and multinational companies.\n7. Put an end to farmers\' exploitation by big traders and MNCs in government-regulated agriculture produce markets.\n8. Put an end to monopoly of Indian and foreign corporate and multinational companies over trade of agriculture inputs. Make these inputs available to farmers at subsidised rates.\n9. Immediately release detained and imprisoned intellectuals, democratic rights activists and student activists all over the country. Withdraw false cases registered against them.\n10. Withdraw all restrictions imposed against the right to struggle. Take steps to ensure the right to struggle.\n11. Repeal the ordinance imposing a fine of Rs one crore and imprisonment for five years on helpless farmers burning paddy stubble.\n12. Make full arrangements for harmless disposal of stubble according to directions of the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal. Else, pay Rs 200 per quintal bonus on paddy in lieu of extra expenses for this purpose.\n13. Marginal relief of not imposing interest over interest given to other loanees should primarily be given to farmers.\n\nWhile the impact of other demands are pretty self-explanatory, I will focus on the second major demand- the making of MSP a legal right, a seemingly innocuous demand where of course the "farmers" are in the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/know-about-the-kisan-unions-leading-the-biggest-farmers-agitation-in-delhi-in-30-years-1746468-2020-12-03?\n\nAre you sure MSP theek hai?\n\n\nInternational price of wheat on average is Rs 1400 per quintal vs the MSP of Rs 1975 per quintal. So, MSP is a good 40% above the international prices! No exports can happen at this rate.\n\n\nWhile supply is great, demand is not growing as much. Look at the wheat consumption in India. As you see, the demand is consistently below supply by ~ 10 mn tons.\n\nIndia already has wheat surplus &amp; we need less of it (2)Advanced seeds are causing yields to explode resulting in bumper harvests which aggravate the problem (3) Since exports potential is absent, all produce has to be paid by Indians\n\nEven as Punjab &amp; Haryana grow only around 30% of wheat &amp; paddy, FCI procures over 50-60% of wheat/paddy from Punjab. Now imagine 100% of wheat, paddy being procured at 40% above international prices while we don\'t even need all of that as a country. Who pays for this wastage- us.\n\nFCI’s borrowing from nation small savings fund has already risen from R 70,000 crore in FY 2017 to Rs 191,000 crore in FY 20. This is in addition to the food subsidy bill of Rs 184,000 crore for FY 20. Moreover, over 32% of FCI cost of procurement just goes towards middlemen, mandi fees- now the 40% jacked up prices of MSP over international rates makes some sense?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9atytp6bty261.jpg\n\n#Not just this, currently only a fraction of the wheat produced is bought at the artifically jacked up 40% higher prices of MSP. The "farmers" not only want to make this a universal price for wheat but for all produce. What effect this will have on food prices is pretty self-evident. Fixing in hard MSPs not decided by market prices, by asking for banning any purchases below MSP INCIndia is essentially asking for household expenses on food to go up 20-50%.\n\nWhatever report you open, MSP is cited as the reason for spiralling inflation in the past, even by dear Columbiagrad.\n\nhttps://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/msp-on-crops-has-major-impact-on-inflation-rbi-61489#:~:text=In%20its%20annual%20report%20(2017,the%202018%2D19%20Union%20budget.&amp;text=RBI%20found%20that%20there%20is,on%20inflation%20due%20to%20MSP.\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/how-msp-based-plan-will-spur-inflation-and-cripple-exports/1211300/\n\nhttps://www.epw.in/journal/2018/47/commentary/minimum-support-price-and-inflation.html\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/raghuram-rajan-blames-high-food-prices-on-frequent-minimum-support-price-hikes/articleshow/31058626.cms?from=mdr\n\nBut haa abhi to humein farmer\'s protests dekhna hai...food inflation, gareeb logo ke bare me baad me sochenge.\n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1334378936780926976.html'<br />Author: 'alubonda'  id: 'k7u624'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k7u624/demands_by_the_farmerunions_and_their/</li>

There are some in the community who are spreading hate and bigotry. So my post is about them. Kindly don't equate it to whole community.\n\nWhat I have been observing from past some days is the pattern of some of the Sikh artists who are all praising Bhindranwale and indirectly pushing for Khalistani propaganda. This somewhere indicates the kind of hold fanatics have on our artists and the whole industry. No one is born bigoted. This artists are made to believe that if they want to succeed in the industry then they have to follow this pathway of distancing themselves from rest of the community. Behave like a supremacist and contempt for Hindus in general. Once they starts walking on that path they experience rise in industry and then they think this is the right way so they don't wanna ditch it. Instead they want to further go deep down this rabid hole of hatred and bigotry. Every artist wants to find that element which becomes baton of success for them and the people in the industry who are the gatekeepers make this artist to follow this or else they won't succeed. Others follow this artists which furthers sows more hatred in the community. They can't ditch this behavior cause now its ingrained in their mindset which sees as way of success. So, its difficult for them to change at this point. This is decades of propaganda which are showing their true colors. I hope we can all see it and don't indulge in any sort of counter propaganda of equal hate cause that's what they want. They really want us to fight among ourselves. \n\nIn fact if you apply this to other communities, there also it fits the pattern. Muslim artists have to believe in certain narrative like whitewashing of Mughal's atrocity and glorifying their fake history or Hindu artists have to have contempt for Indic faiths, ridiculing their culture and festival etc etc. This gate keepers are the ones whose authority needs to be smashed. They are the one who are pushing their own bigoted thoughts and propaganda among those who wants to enter in the industry. \n\nThis is my rant for the Sunday.

Whether you call it Kashi, Varanasi, or Banaras the city has a  divine place in India. It has many temples that have hundreds of years  of history in their foundation. **One of such temples is the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple situated near Banaras Hindu University.**  Said to be founded by none other than Tulsi Das it is one of the most  important temples in the city and as such is crowded at all times but  especially on Tuesday, the day of Lord Hanuman.\n\nOn  the day of 7 March 2006, the devotes of this temple were shaken to the  core. The Muslim terrorists Lashkar e Toiba and other Muslim Terrorists  targeted this temple to further their agenda of Jihad. **They targeted the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple and Varanasi Cantt. Railway Station as targets of their Bomb blasts.**\n\nThe  first bomb that was planted in the Temple was set off at 06:20 PM. For  many devotees chanting the prayer of Lord Hanuman became the last thing  they ever could say. Tuesday is considered to be the most auspicious day  of Lord Hanuman Ji, many people come to Temple on this day whether they  were newlyweds coming to ask for a prosperous life, Children who came  there for good luck in their exams that were going on, or Tourist who  used to come to visit this 400-year-old Institution. And as such this  day was selected carefully so there will be the most casualties. The  bomb was placed in a container near a gate at the temple where many  people used to sit. **The bomb blast took Ten lives and Injured 40 peoples with even children being part of the casualties.**\n\nAnother  blast went off at Varanasi Cantt. Railway station soon thereafter. One  of the biggest Railway stations of the city was always busy and the bomb  took Eleven lives and injured 20 others. The Govt had sprung to action  by now and began to find other planted bombs. **On that day the police reported six other bombs which they successfully defused.**\n\nThese  blasts were done to conjure fear in Hindus but Varanasi valiantly rose  again, with the Prayers in the temple being continued the next day.  Hindus refrained from any violence and mourned their loss in a peaceful  manner. The city was injured by the act of Terrorism and Jihad but the  people stood their ground and carried on.\n\nSonia  Gandhi, leader of the ruling Congress party, came from Delhi to express  her grief but the culprits never saw any punishment. SP the party in UP  requested the withdrawal of cases against the culprits in 2012. To this  day I have not been able to find any information on if the culprits  ever got the punishment for their actions.\n\nThe  blasts which would have not been forgotten during any other tenure were  just relegated to a list during UPA rule. But with so many terrorist  attacks on civilians during their rule, these terrorist attacks on  Hindus felt like an everyday occurrence. These blasts have left the  scars forever in the heart of Varanasi and until there is justice given  to the devotees of Lord Hanuman these scars will never fade away.\n\n*P.S - If you find any factual mistake in the above article please feel free to correct.*\n\nSources - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Varanasi_bombings)\n\n[IndiaToday - SP requests withdrawal of Case](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/varanasi-blast-officials-oppose-accuseds-release-124770-2012-12-19)'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'k7bpgx'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k7bpgx/the_2006_varanasi_blasts/</li>

They're pretty sturdy and aesthetic and are available for cheap (250-300 rupees) and if you wanna buy them/gift them to someone please dm me and I'll share the link to in my Instagram (for the photos) with you!

      <li>Title::: 'Not only was repeal of APMC &amp; Essential Commodities Act in Cong 2019 Manifesto, but a look into what UPA installed Planning Commission had recommended over the years'<br />Body: 'CONGRESS\' HYPOCRISY ON FARM REFORMS\n\n&gt;In its 2019 manifesto, Congress promised to "repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committee’s Act &amp; make trade in agri. produce-including export and inter-state trade-free from all restrictions"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335158208621514752\n\n&gt;Right before 2014 elections, Congress gvot asked Congress-led states to de-notify fruits &amp; vegetables from the APMC Act. In pursuance, Congress ruled states of Karnataka, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalya &amp; Haryana de-notified Fruits &amp; Vegetables!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335158778623246336\n\n&gt;Did you know? UPA govt also formulated the Model APMC Rules 2007 for implementation of Model APMC Act. After coming to power in 2004, Congress-led UPA persuaded states to adopt the Model APMC Act 2003 to liberalize state agricultural marketing laws.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159164654391297\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Min. In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under Harshvardhan Patil, Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs Minsiter in Maharashtra. In 2013 it proposed the following bill for barrier free markets:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335159625700687872\n\n&gt;The Planning Commission in its 2011 report also over mulled the policy option of enacting an “Inter-State Agriculture Produce Trade and Commerce Regulation Act” under entry 42 (Inter-State Trade and Commerce) of the Union list.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160034091618304\n\n&gt;In April 2011, then Cabinet Secretary while considering the Note for COS suggested to promote Inter-State Trade &amp; Commerce of agriculture produce across States/UTs through the instrument of Central Legislation. Guess who was in power? Congress-led UPA!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160345854283778\n\n&gt;In pursuance, DAC in consultation with Ministry of Law prepared draft Bill titled as “Agricultural Produce Inter State Trade &amp; Commerce (Development and Regulation) Bill 2012”. However, it was not pursued further. So Congress also wanted barrier free trade of agriculture produce.\n\n&gt;Contract farming has been recognized as a chief enabler in various reports of the Planning Commission &amp; has been implemented by several states under the State APMC Acts. The 11th Five Year Plan, 2007–12, released during the tenure of Congress-led UPA govt mentions:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335160907035410434\n\n&gt;Planning Commission report XII Five Year Plan 2012-17: “There\'s a need to promote both pvt invt &amp; alternative marketing channels to improve marketing system of agri produce by way of direct marketing contract farming &amp; setting up of markets in pvt &amp; co-op sectors, e-trading, etc“.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161055299870721\n\n&gt;While discussing ‘Issues in Expanding Agricultural Marketing and Processing’, the 12th Five Year Plan  (2012-17) prepared by Planning Commission during UPA years advocates contract farming!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161336716644353\n\n&gt;Haryana (2007, INC), Karnataka (2003, INC), Maharashtra (2006, INC-NCP), MP (2003, INC), Odisha (2006, BJD), &amp; others made provisions for contract farming under state APMC Act. Punjab (2013, SAD), Tamil Nadu (2019, AIADMK), Odisha (2020, BJD) passed separate Contract Farming Acts\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335161724320710656\n\n&gt;In 2019 Lok Sabha Elections Manifesto, Congress promised to replace the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 by an enabling law that can be invoked only in case of emergencies.

Now when Modi brings it from paper to reality, Congress is opposing it!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/knowthenation/status/1335162624695103488\n\n&gt;UPA constituted ‘Committee of State Ministers, In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms’ under chairmanship of Harshvardhan Patil, then Minister for Cooperation &amp; Parliamentary Affairs, Govt. of Maharashtra.

      <li>Title::: 'Why new farm laws will not kill farmers?'<br />Body: ' In essence, the issue here is of liberalization vs Socialism. The government wants to liberalize the agriculture sector while the opposition (political parties and protesting farmers) want the government to hold their hand and take care of the agriculture sector. We believe that the introduced bills will not, as some are suggesting, “kill farmers” mainly because while the change can be difficult, liberalization and increased freedom is a better option for long as it will increase competition and efficiency of the sector. In addition to this, such changes are necessary and inevitable to bring the agricultural sector out of the homeostasis it’s been under for over a decade. Also, while the way these bills were introduced is debatable and we acknowledge that these bills are not perfect, their introduction is favourable for India as it will help the agriculture sector to become more competitive and will reduce its dependence on the government. Furthermore, rather than debating about the soundness of these bills, we should be more concerned with the way they will be implemented. The one thing we are sure of from experience is that somehow Indian administration always falls short when it comes to implementation of new policies and amendments. Therefore, while the introduction of these bills can be regarded as a progressive step for the Indian agricultural sector, it will be interesting to see how the government will handle the transition. \n\n[Why new farm laws will not kill farmers?](http://www.thoughtsandponderings.com/why-new-farm-laws-will-not-kill-farmers/)'<br />Author: 'Beneficial_Dog_8910'  id: 'k76s4w'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k76s4w/why_new_farm_laws_will_not_kill_farmers/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Can women climb electric poles and other stories.'<br />Body: 'Living in a democratic set-up has its own advantages &amp; perils. While on one hand you are free to do as you please, but one’s free will prevails only till the mid-night knock of the bovine brigade; the modi(fied) followers or till one is hauled up for contempt. Sometimes all three are the same people undergoing an identity crisis.\n\nBy the way one could also die on the roads because the ambulance you are travelling in gets held up because some group mistook a road for a ‘Bagh’ and decides to sit it out, till Covid does them apart (judgement day).\xa0\n\nWe can go on about it, but lesser perks like: being able to spit, piss and litter anywhere one pleases, let out pets to take their dump on colony roads, or park our domesticated cattle on the ‘Chowk’ or wake up the neighborhood the whole night in the name of a Jagaran, more than compensate for the little inconveniences of a pseudo democracy.\n\nTo express my sentiments I may need to write a whole book, more easily expressed by R.K.Lakshman on a single frame once upon a time. But a book it has to be, because cartoons are now held in contempt by the powers that be. Who wants to be hauled over the coals, better leave it to the merchants closer to ‘Race Course Road’. Like they say ‘coiley ke dalali me muh kala’.\n\nBut every once in a while, our Institutions shine. Take the case in Telangana.\xa0 Female candidates were rejected for posts of Linesmen by Discom’s who believed that females can’t climb poles to rectify electric lines. Ironic that in a country where ladies are believed to light up households in their Lakshmi avatar; in an era when even the broadminded US of A has accepted a female as a vice-president, we still have amongst our midst organisations that believe that there are still jobs for which females are unfit. But the courts would not touch that belief with a barge pole and took up pole position to launch the ladies where they rightly belonged. All is not well that has not yet ended well, the candidates are now directed to take a test to prove that they indeed can climb poles. I sincerely believe that it’s a small detail, the ladies will eventualy prevail and give a shock to the Discom managers.\n\nLife of a satirist is made easy in such pseudo democracy where everyone thinks that he is king, thereby providing us fodder for our mills.

      <li>Title::: 'Book Review: Books v. Cigarettes - George Orwell'<br />Body: "**This is part review/ part summary. Estimated read time=5 minutes, 44 seconds**. Contains 1148 words \n\nPublishers: Penguin Books. This book is part of the Penguin Classics series.\n\n*Gist: It's a collection of essays by George Orwell. It begins with a dilemma about whether he spends more money on reading or smoking. Then he goes on to explore everything from the perils of 2nd hand bookshops to the dubious profession of being a critic, to freedom of the press to what patriotism really means.*\n\nIt's a short 65 page read.\n\n    Chapter 1 and 4 are the only ones worth reading! Especially Chapter 4. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n**Chapter 1: Books v. Cigarettes (*****Tribune*****, 8 February 1946; S.E.)**\n\n* The idea that buying, or even the reading, of books is an expensive hobby and beyond the reach of the average person is so widespread that it deserves some detailed examination - **Which is what he does in this chapter by showing that reading is one of the cheaper recreations; after listening to radio which is probably the cheapest.**\n   * He counts the books he owns, accumulated over 15+ years(Bought, second-hand, given to him, review copies, complimentary copies, borrowed &amp; not returned, temporarily on loan; total 900 books)\n   * Then he calculates the total price 165.15 British Pounds.\n   * Others costs, such as newspapers and periodicals were his biggest expenses overall.\n   * His final estimate over 15 years comes at 25 Pounds/year\n* At current day (war times), he argues that this cost is less than the cost of cigarettes per year\n   * Even at pre-war times, if you include cigarettes+beer, its almost the same as the cost of reading.\n* Further, he writes about the value you derive from reading, including the impact on altering one's whole attitude to life.\n* He concludes by saying, that if the book consumption by average person continues to remain low, then it is because reading is a less exciting pastime than going to pub, cinema, etc., and not because books are expensive.\n\n**Chapter 2: Bookshop Memories (Fortnightly November 1936)**\n\nIn this chapter, he shares his experience &amp; his memories working in a second-hand bookshop. And ends with saying, that while he was in it, he lost his love for books, since he seldom had to tell lies about books, and that left a distaste in him.\n\n* Its a great look into the world of British bookshops of early 20th century. There is mention of all the different kinds of customers that came in, and their peculiar habits and intricacies..\n* Then he writes about how interesting it was to see that men stuck to certain areas of fiction (those possible to respect, or detective stories)\n* He notes, how it is in the lending library that you see people's real tastes, not their pretended ones, and that how the classical English novelists have dropped out of favor in this lending library, while the sell just fine.\n\n**Chapter 3: Confessions of a Book Reviewer (3 May 1946)**\n\nHere he writes about the classic writer/book reviewer, and his eternal moral paralysis when reviewing books. Its a realist take on daily habits and difficulties encountered by reviewers.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Prevention of Literature (January 1946)**\n\nHere he starts the chapter by writing about a meeting he attended, wherein the speakers spoke on freedom of press, liberty, obscenity in literature, and eulogies on Soviet Russia\n\n* Here he notes, that liberty to discuss sex questions in print was okay, but political liberty discussion was not mentioned. There wasn't any mention of the various books killed in the country or in U.S. during the war, and in net effect the meeting was demonstration in favor of censorship.\n\nHe didn't find this surprising, since he says the idea of intellectual liberty was under attack from two directions. 1) the theoretical enemies - the apologists of totalitarianisms. 2.) its immediate, practical enemies, monopoly and bureaucracy.\n\n    The writer or journalist's integrity is thwarted by the general drift of society rather than active persecution.\n\nThe things working against him are concentration of press in hands of few rich men, grip of monopoly on radio and films, unwillingness of the public to spend money on books, making it necessary for nearly every writer to earn part of his living by hack work, &amp; dictating his opinions by Ministry of Information and British Council - working on themes handed to him and never telling the whole truth. Such a writer struggles in his fate, with no help.\n\n* In the past, throughout the protestant centuries, the idea of rebellion and idea of intellectual integrity were mixed up. Wherein a heretic was one who refused to outrage his own conscience.\n* But, now the same is not true anymore. Since it is dangerous and the independence of the writer and artist is eaten away by vague economic forces, and undermined by those who should be its defenders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Further he writes about a more concerning (to him) proposition that freedom is undesirable and that intellectual honesty is a form of antisocial selfishness. In his opinion straight forward reportage is the only literature that matters.\n\nHe says the enemies of intellectual liberty always tries to present their case as a plea for discipline versus individualism, while the issue of truth vs untruth is as far as possible kept in background. He writes how the Catholic and the Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent. Each of them tacitly claims that the truth has already been revealed, and that the heretic, if he not simply a fool, is secretly aware of the truth but merely resists it out of selfish motives. And the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue.\n\n*Communist thesis: Pure freedom will only exist in a classless society, and one is more nearly free when one is working to bring about such a society. This claim is furthered by aiming to establish classless society (USSR). If this claim is allowed, then there is almost no assault on common sense and common decency that cannot be justified.*\n\nThen he writes about the fog of lies and misinformation by communists, and their effects.\n\n**In England, the immediate enemies of truthfulness, and hence of Freedom of thought, are the press lords, film magnets, and bureaucrats, and in long term, the weakening of the desire for liberty among the intellectuals themselves.**\n\nHe further talks about self-censorship amongst writers at length.

      <li>Title::: 'Queen Didda - The warrior Queen of Kashmir'<br />Body: "# Early Life of Queen Didda Ji\n\nKashmir’s  history before the invasion is all but lost, with only a few things  known and even lesser figures surviving the test of time and  barbarianism of Islamic Invasions. One of the figures that has yet  survived these tests and stands above every other will be none other  than Queen Didda.\n\nNot much is  known about Queen Didda Ji’s early life. Most of what we know about  Queen Didda comes from Kalhana’s portrayal of the queen in his book  Rajatarangini and some other sources but none of them has many sources  on the Queen of Kashmir. Although two female rulers even before Queen  Didda Ji had come Queen Didda Ji takes much of the space in  Rajatarangini's book due to her iconic rein.\n\nAccording to Historians, **Queen Didda Ji was the daughter of the Sinhraja**.  Sinhraja's Kingdom, Lohar, lied between the route of Punjab and Kashmir  in Pir Panjal Mountain range. Queen Didda Ji often mentioned as  Charanhina (footless) in Rajatarangini was born with a deformity in her  leg. She had a Woman called Valga who would carry her to places and even  participate in races. She later built a Math (Shrine) for her. **Although  the disability never made less capable in her own eyes as she trained  in various warrior arts and defense it did in her father's eyes removed  her to be considered in the contention of his throne.**\n\nDuring  that time the kingdom of Kashmir was in turmoil. There was a power  struggle in Kashmir at the time. The minister Parvagupta had become the  king after getting rid of the previous King. Parvagupta would only live  for a year as a king, dying a year later and leaving the throne to his  son Kshemagupta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Marriage to Kshemagupta and taking reins of Kashmir\n\nDuring  this time Sinhraja father of Queen Didda decided to marry her daughter  to the Kshemagupta which will unite their Kingdom. Therefore, **In 950 CE at age of 26 Queen Didda Ji married Kshemagupta and came to Srinagara.**  Kshemagupta was not a great administrator, he wasted his time being an  addict to vices of life, like alcohol, hunting, pleasure, and gambling.  So, the task of administration of Kashmir fell on Queen Didda Ji. Not to  let the opportunity go to waste. **The Queen of Kashmir began to assert her control over the administration.**  The queen had a great influence on her husband, so much so that the  Coins According to Kalhana, Didda had such a big influence on her  husband that the dual coins of Didda-Kshemagupta (Di-Kshema).\n\nIn  958 Kshemagupta died of a fever he contracted during Hunting, after his  death his and Queen Didda Ji's son Abhimanyu was made the emperor.  Abhimanyu was all but a child during that time so as per the customs  Queen Didda took the rein of the kingdom. Many nobles, ministers, and  influential families were not happy with someone as capable as her  taking the reins of the kingdom. They all had some amount of stakes and  had spent years stealing from kings. They wanted to take control of the  Kingdom from the queen in one manner or another.\n\n**Assuming the throne is losing the grasp over the kingdom many revolts started across the state.**  Queen Didda Ji however proved more than formidable in controlling the  kingdom and tried to dispose of these aristocrats who rebelled and took  any form of power they had away from them. **Queen Didda Ji ended these revolts with ruthlessness never seen before.**  One of the conspirators against Queen Didda, Prime minister Phalguna  fled to Poonch to save his life and but all was banished to that place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Fighting Various rebellions and building a stable Kashmir\n\nOther  conspirators against her were Kshemagupta’s nephew Mahiman and Patala.  They gathered allies and surrounded her when she was visiting the  Padmasvamin temple with her son. **She asked to negotiate and snuck her son to a nearby safe place while she bribed the members of enemy forces.**  She managed to win the struggle with help of her minister Naravahana  and managed to win the tussle. After which she executed both of her  husband’s nephew.\n\nOne of the  people fighting against Queen Didda in this alliance was none other than  a capable warrior named Yashodhara. Queen seeing the potential in the  warrior spared her life so he may be used later.\n\nAnd  as she had thought Yashodhara came to her use when she needed someone  to lead the force against the neighboring King Thakkana. Yashodhara was  given the task of winning the war and taking control over the kingdom,  Yashodhara was successful in the former but he made an agreement and let  King Thakkana rule even after Victory. Yashodhara came home expecting a  warm welcome but Queen Didda, angry over his failure to attain control  of the enemy's kingdom and partially worried that the new general who  was relishing in his newfound popularity will start another revolt,  tried to arrest Yashodhara.\n\nYashodhara  escaped the attempt and did what the Queen feared and started a revolt.  Many Nobel men and ministers joined him. The Queen once again with help  of her ministers Naravahana and Rakka ended the revolt as swiftly as  she could.\n\nThe tales of the queen  crushing her enemies and ending any chance of rebellion had become  common news. People now had begun to fear the Queen Didda who had gained  the reputation of being fearless and ruthless. Anyone who stood against  her was quickly taken care of. She showed no mercy to anyone even if  the conspirator was from her family. However, both of her trusted  ministers Naravahana and Rakka passed away shortly thereafter. And as a  new rebellion was rising amongst Damaras against her she used the  banished minister Phalguna who was living in Poonch to end the new  rising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Tragedies struck the great queen\n\nA  series of tragedies soon stuck her again as her son Abhimanyu passed  away in 972 CE. The Queen was filled with grief and mourned the death of  her son. She built a temple called Abhimanyusvamin and Abhimanyupura  town, which is now called Bimyan. She also laid foundations for  Diddasvamin temple, the Diddapura town, and the Diddamath, now called  the Diddmar area of Srinagar. She laid 64 foundations of Temples and Maths (Shrines).\n\nAfter the death of her son,  she made her grandson Nandigupta the next ruler but he soon passed away  too, followed soon by the death of her second grandson Tribhuvangupta  who was just crowned a year after. She made her youngest grandson  Bhimagupta the king but he passed away too in 981 CE. Many people  started accusing her of witchcraft and blamed her for the deaths of her  grandsons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A new turn in life\n\nQueen  Didda Ji's life took a turn for the better when a young man by name of  Tunga entered her life. Tunga was Khasa buffalo herdsman from Poonch, He  used to work as a letter carrier in her government. The Queen took a  keen interest in the young man and promoted him many times over until he  reached the rank of Prime Minister. There is a consensus amongst  historians that Tunga was the lover of the queen. But any doubts on his  capabilities were proved worthless since Tunga proved to be a capable  leader and maintained his position for 40 years.\n\nKalhana mentions in his book that the **“Those  treacherous ministers who for 60 years…had robbed 16 kings, from King  Gopala to Abhimanyu, of their dignity, lives, and riches, were quickly  exterminated by the energy of Queen Didda.”**\n\nQueen  Didda Ji made Kashmir a prosperous state and developed it by putting  her heart and soul into it. She was as caring as she was cunning and  made Kashmir a stable land that it had not been for years. Various  rebellions that had made Kashmir weak in the past were nowhere to be  seen. She knew she needed an heir and selected a young and capable man  Samgrāmarāja. She made Samgrāmarāja and Tunga take an oath that they  will work together to make Kashmir prosperous and Strong. An oath which  they both followed upon on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Foundation of Lohara Dynasty\n\nQueen Didda Ji’s actions however ruthless led to a new era for Kashmir. Even after her death in 1003 CE, **she laid the foundation of the Lohara dynasty which began when her chosen heir Samgrāmarāja took the reins of her kingdom.** And Tunga as promised served the dynasty long after the death of her Queen and proved valuable to the growth of the kingdom.\n\nSamgrāmarāja  proved to be one of the most significant Hindu Kings in history as he  defeated the incoming invasions from Mahmud of Ghazni and supported **Trilochanpala**  to fight Muslim Invasions. You can attribute the Samgrāmarāja’s success  a lot to the stable foundations' Queen Didda Ji left for the Lohara  Dynasty.\n\n**As ruthless as the Didda Devi of Kashmir was she became the building blocks of Stable Kashmir for many years to come.**  Her life may have been full of controversies but also full of success  that many rulers had never seen before. She encompasses what a True  Leader should be, nurturing the nation regardless of the price that  needs to be paid. The only sad thing is her contributions are lost to  time as modern historians chose to highlight the invaders more than the  defenders.\n\n*P.S  - If you find any factual mistake  in the above article please feel  free to correct.

The Nazis pledged to restore German cultural values, reverse the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, turn back the perceived threat of a Communist uprising, put the German people back to work, and restore Germany to its "rightful position" as a world power. Hitler and other Nazi propagandists were highly successful in directing the population\'s anger and fear against the Jews; against the Marxists (Communists and Social Democrats); and against those the Nazis held responsible for signing both the armistice of November 1918 and the Versailles treaty, and for establishing the parliamentary republic. Hitler and the Nazis often referred to the latter as "November criminals."\n\nHitler and other Nazi speakers carefully tailored their speeches to each audience. For example, when speaking to businessmen, the Nazis downplayed antisemitism and instead emphasized anti-communism and the return of German colonies lost through the Treaty of Versailles. When addressed to soldiers, veterans, or other nationalist interest groups, Nazi propaganda emphasized military buildup and return of other territories lost after Versailles. Nazi speakers assured farmers in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein that a Nazi government would prop up falling agricultural prices.

      <li>Title::: 'Boost your immune system with the right nutrition, an apt workout, and a nature-connected life.'<br />Body: " \n\nThe word Immunity has been very much in focus the past couple of months post the break out of pandemic coronavirus.\n\n**What is immunity?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[www.snaana.com](https://preview.redd.it/ki6aop6tc4361.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5997eece538ef81d7488c3d46fe32b7f14d8ab68)\n\nThe dictionary definition of the word immunity says – the quality or state of being immune, especially a condition of being able to resist a particular disease especially through preventing a pathogenic microorganism, or by counteracting the effects of its products.\n\nSo in other words, it's the immune system that creates a defense and protects the body from risk-oriented invasions. Hence a healthy &amp; well functioning immune system is vital for survival.\n\n**How to build immunity?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[www.snaana.com](https://preview.redd.it/igy83mevc4361.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3364ed662c05c363055db7eb5e74d07791a56b61)\n\nPhysical activity, the right nutrition, and of course a connection with nature are the ways to a healthy lifestyle that contributes to building immunity in the body.  The better the defense system of the body against diseases, the higher the immunity is and hence lower will be the risk of falling sick.\n\n**Physical activity** – A moderate regular exercise is helpful to strengthen the system as it can help flush bacteria out of the body reducing the chance of getting cold, cough, and other illnesses. Exercise contributes to healthy cardio health, balanced blood pressure, control body weight, and improved circulation making the cells &amp; tissues work efficiently. Exercise is one of the important pillars of a healthy body.  \n\n**Nutrition** \\- Adequate and appropriate quality nutrition intake is very important for the optimal functioning of the immune system. An apt working immune system needs different levels of energy at different times to protect the body. For example – during the time of infection, an active immune system increases the demand of the energy to initiate an effective response against invaders – pathogens. Thus it's the nutrition that backs up white blood cells to perform with the best immunological outcomes.  And therefore it is important to keep the body free from any deficiency with the right nutrition-rich food.  Eating too much nutrition too is bad especially when it turns you obese. Obesity can impair the body’s immune functioning.  \n\nThe immune system functioning in the body changes with age, thus important to ensure the right intake as per the need of the time.  Vaccination too is one of the ways to immune the body against many known diseases however it’s not possible to make vaccines for many illnesses because of hundreds of varieties of viruses causing the same illness.  \n\n**Connect with Nature** – Nature can heal anything and everything. All that’s needed is time off the busy schedule to revive the body holistically – bringing sync between the body, mind, and soul.  Our super busy lifestyles have created a disconnect with nature. And since our body is a part of nature and we have to pay the separation cost in some form.  \n\nOur mother nature has provided us air, water, soil, and plants as a cure to prevent and treat bodies from various illnesses. Thousands of years old Ayurveda system of medicine is based on the ingredients present in nature and many of these ingredients have been found very effective in treating disorders in human bodies. Some of these herbs that promote better immunity functioning are [Shyama Tulsi,](https://www.snaana.com/tulsi-basil-hydrosol)[Ginger](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-ginger), [Clove](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-clove-leaf), [peppermint,](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-peppermint) [marjoram](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-marjoram),[chamomile](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-chamomile),[lavender](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-lavender), [neem](https://www.snaana.com/neem-hydrosol), [curry leaf](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-curry-leaf), [lemongrass](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-Lemongrass),[rosemary](https://www.snaana.com/steam-distilled-hydrosol-of-rosemary), [turmeric](https://www.snaana.com/turmeric-hydrosol), Kalonji Oil, hemp seed oil, perilla seed oil, etc.      \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[www.snaana.com](https://preview.redd.it/cyamqpkxc4361.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7db7cc44d2a0381a470e06e8cf8d90a1b70edb3)\n\nMalfunctioning of the immune system can cause different illnesses in different bodies.

      <li>Title::: 'Why new farm laws will not kill farmers?'<br />Body: 'In essence, the issue here is of liberalization vs Socialism. The government wants to liberalize the agriculture sector while the opposition (political parties and protesting farmers) want the government to hold their hand and take care of the agriculture sector. We believe that the introduced bills will not, as some are suggesting, “kill farmers” mainly because while the change can be difficult, liberalization and increased freedom is a better option for long as it will increase competition and efficiency of the sector. In addition to this, such changes are necessary and inevitable to bring the agricultural sector out of the homeostasis it’s been under for over a decade. Also, while the way these bills were introduced is debatable and we acknowledge that these bills are not perfect, their introduction is favourable for India as it will help the agriculture sector to become more competitive and will reduce its dependence on the government. Furthermore, rather than debating about the soundness of these bills, we should be more concerned with the way they will be implemented. The one thing we are sure of from experience is that somehow Indian administration always falls short when it comes to implementation of new policies and amendments. Therefore, while the introduction of these bills can be regarded as a progressive step for the Indian agricultural sector, it will be interesting to see how the government will handle the transition. \n\n[http://www.thoughtsandponderings.com/why-new-farm-laws-will-not-kill-farmers/](http://www.thoughtsandponderings.com/why-new-farm-laws-will-not-kill-farmers/)'<br />Author: 'Beneficial_Dog_8910'  id: 'k602vw'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k602vw/why_new_farm_laws_will_not_kill_farmers/</li>

America is outright backstabber when it comes to India. Right now they are supporting only cause Modi has the numbers but the moment there are cracks in his administration, CIA would actively try to dismantle him and would not waste any more time in furthering their own agenda.

      <li>Title::: 'Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisor’s incompetence to process India’s Agriculture Bills.'<br />Body: 'As an Indian born Canadian citizen, I am in an utter disbelief in regards to how current government of Canada has responded to India’s Agriculture Bills -- which are nothing short of a **CALCULATED MASTERMOVE!** \n\nIn 2019, **10,281 suicides** were reported from the farming sector by National Crime Records Bureau of India. That on average is **28 suicides per day** or at least one suicide/per hour. If this statistic does not call for an immediate **change in India’s farming sector** then I don’t know what else does. \n\nCanada’s ill-informed prime minister and some news agencies were very quick to address and take sides but, a simple search of the agriculture reform bills of India tells a story that a no democratic nation should object against. Unless of course, there is an agenda that Canadian citizens are unaware of that prime minister is advocating on their behalf.\n\nIn two days, at a cost of researching from home, and about two large double-double coffees from Tim Hortons, I have concluded the following,\n\n1) Prime Minister Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisors are ill-informed.  \n2) Prime Minister Justine Trudeau &amp; his advisors are incompetent at analyzing bills that empowers India’s farmers.   \n3) Prime Minister not only is quick to condemn actions, but **often** when being proven wrong–staying silent instead of correcting one’s mistakes is the choice this elected leader makes.  \n4) The focus is on the agriculture reforms happening in India, not on black face or financially colluded WE charity practices supported by Prime Minister. So, for the purpose of this post, racial and financial incidents related to the Prime Minister are purposefully ignored.\n\nThere are three agriculture bills that need to be summarized here so I have compiled my findings from all three and have concluded them below in a point form,\n\n  \n\n# 1st reform bill/act [Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce Act 2020]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The act gives farmers freedom of **choice of sale** and purchase of agriculture produce. \\[Prior this was only done through a committee called APMC - Agricultural Produce Market Committee.\\]\n* It will promote barrier free trade within and outside of the states. \\[Prior farmers were required to sell their produce through only APMC designated market areas and **NOTHING ELSE**.\\]\n* Farmer no longer to be charged any cess or levy for the sale of their produce. \\[No longer need to bear transportation cost as purchaser is required to arrange their appropriate transportation for the amount of produce/crops they are purchasing.\\]\n* India to move all the trades and transactions to digital platform knows as E-NAM (National Agriculture Market) - - The digital platform E-NAM will also function for previously ran practices under APMC. \\[**It is for all, not just for a selective group.**\\]\n* Freedom to trade at farmgate, cold storage, warehouse &amp; processing units…**it is a FARMER’s choice**.\n* **No more middlemen** required for a farmer to sell their crops. \\[Can you imagine the opposite of such that was in place? And such is the side PM of Canada has chosen to support. Hang in there…\\]\n* Some agitated and ill-informed farmers have requested that Minimum Support Price (MSP) to exist – The government has clearly stated that if a farmer wishes to sell through the same practice that has been in place prior, so be it. **To each their own.**  \n\n# 2nd reform bill/act [Contract farming]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Farmers can now interact directly with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, large retailers, exporters, etc. **No longer farmers have the only option to sell at only APMC**. Freedom?\n* Government assures price assurances to the farmers before they sow the crops. Under any circumstances the farmers are entitled to the minimum price. If at such point in time, market price is high, well **farmers should reap the benefits! NOT THE MIDDLEMEN.**\n* Reduces risks taken by farmers in India as contracts are signed digitally leaving a clear demands agreed upon by both sides.\n* Farmers to be shielded by unpredictable rise and fall of market prices.\n* This act also enables farmers to have access to modern technologies, better seed and other tools.\n* Reduces middlemen costs will improve income of farmers. \n* Introduced a dispute resolution mechanism that can help settle disputes. No need to repeatedly go to a court over a dispute. A local dispute redressal mechanism to help.\n* Impetus to research and new technology in agriculture sector.\n* Under this bill, a farmer will have complete control in a contract to fix sale price of his/her choice for the crops they are growing. \n* Expedited payments within 3 days! **\\[Heck, how long before your cheque gets processed here?\\]**\n* Over 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations being created to bring together small farmers and to ensure **remunerative** pricing for farm produce.\n* Upon using the digital platform, once a contract is signed, the purchasing consumer will pick up the produce directly from the farm. \n\n#  3rd reform bill/act [The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Removes commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from list of essential commodities. \n   * \\[Prior there was a restriction as to how much a purchaser can buy when it comes to above listed items. This resulted in waste of crops, often resulted in associated costs that had forced farmers to look towards growing something else. The point is, until you grow at mass scale, you cannot reduce your prices. Once you do, not only the nation but trading partners can enjoy the benefits too!\\]\n* This act also removes fears of private investors enforcing excessive regulatory rules on farmers and farmer’s day to day operations. \n* The free and fair market practice will allow for modernization of cold storage and food storage facilities. \n   * India currently loses about 35%-40% of crops due to lack of appropriate storage facilities. This cost is directly on farmers. This loss to farmers is 35,000 crore or **$6,167,400,881.06 Canadian at current exchange rate of 56.75 Rupees.**\n* Government also indicates that during time of war or natural calamity when prices tend to rise, the consumers are also protected with their investment. **Ensuring fair trade for both sides.**\n* Doubling farmer’s income by 2022. Currently they make about **$2/hour** (in a best-case scenario.)\n* Government will aim to create markets where farmers can sell their crops not only digitally but physically **every 80km!**\n\n  \n\n# The noise over the internet -- farmers and their fight for MSP,\n\nLets start with statistical data so that we are not just fighting with words. \n\nIn India, two committees were formed to study the harsh realities imposed on poor farmers,\n\n1. M S Swaminathan Committee in 2006\n2. Santha Kumar Committee in 2015\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Findings from both these committees concluded that the laws that help farmers have been passed in early 2000s but **NOT IMPLEMENTED!** even in 2015!\n   * I urge you to look into their statistics and then urge you to look into Prime Minister Justine Trudeau’s response. \n* 86% of farmers in India are small/medium farmers and remaining 14% are medium/large/mega farmers. Only the 14% are getting the advantage of MSP laws set out in early 2000s. **Would you believe me now if I were to say that our Prime Minister is supporting the rich of the India but not the poor? Does it remind you of the troubles of Justine Trudeau’s India visit?** \n* What makes it worse is that over 75% of paddy growers and over 65% of wheat growers didn’t even know that there was such plan where a government can help them! **When they are not aware of MSP, how do you expect them to get the right price?** \n* Only **1/6** of India’s total rice and wheat output is bought by the government. The remainder…..\n\nSuch is my finding on the agriculture reform bills that Indian government introduced. Instead of bashing such moves, a progressive country such as Canada should applaud the way Indian government is trying to uplift its farmers earning less than $24/day and committing 1 suicide/hour in India.\n\nI totally understand if Prime Minister and his advisors are incapable of processing such simple bills but, making mockery of a country that is trying to uplift its most suppressed citizens is **inhumane**. If this is what current government of Canada is saying about a foreign country and its policies, wonder what their opinions of Canadian farmers are. **Even a rotten apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.**\n\nStay at it Prime Minister Modi &amp; India.'<br />Author: 'KaiPoChe_Canadian'  id: 'k4ra93'<br />Score:108<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k4ra93/justine_trudeau_his_advisors_incompetence_to/</li>

As media prospered with growth, contract salaries increased, wage disparity decreased. 5n\nKanchan Gupta\n@KanchanGupta\n·\n19h\nFreedom to earn more has given journalists financial security and created wealth beyond the wildest imagination of the Wage Board generation. I know of journalists who held on to Wage Board and resisted 'corporatisation of media' till the end. They died bitter and in penury. 6n\nKanchan Gupta\n@KanchanGupta\n·\n19h\nContract jobs and freedom to choose jobs based on negotiated better remuneration gave journalists the break for a better life. Contract farming and the freedom to sell to anybody anywhere can give farmers, big and small, higher returns and a better life. 7n\nKanchan Gupta\n@KanchanGupta\n·\n19h\nStrangely, some journalists who have prospered with contract jobs and 'corporate media' opening new opportunities are loath to concede contract farming with full protection will do good for farmers and the Govt-controlled APMC should die like the Govt-controlled Wage Board. 8n\nKanchan Gupta\n@KanchanGupta\n·\n19h\nThis could be for three reasons:\n1) Political bias (support the #Punjab farmers agitation to screw BJP and help Congress);\n2) Ignorance (Some editors and their factotums have not read the #FarmLaws like they never read #CAA which too they opposed); and,\n3) Middlemen Syndrome.\n9n\nKanchan Gupta\n@KanchanGupta\n·\n19h\nThis is not about Left/Right. It is about reforming the farm sector for benefit of farmers while protecting them. Farmers are free to choose. They can stay with MSP, sell to mandi middlemen and say no to contract farming.\nSome journalists did that by staying with Wage Board.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KanchanGupta/status/1333468931596709890"<br />Author: 'BalHanumanJi'  id: 'k4ko34'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k4ko34/kanchan_gupta_strangely_some_journalists_who_have/</li>

Why didn\'t they accept this earlier?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that\'s it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I won\'t back out. (Although my parents still don\'t know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won\'t go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down.

Like all true engineers, I was intrigued by her looks and bemused by her background.  She had not become famous as the JNU activist as she is now, but I could see that the seed had been planted. \n\nWhile trying to make casual conversation with her over a pizza we had ordered, I realised that my \'rose tinted glasses\' worldview couldn\'t break through beyond the \'veil of darkness\' she had been wearing. Again, like all true engineers, I didn\'t let that bother me and I solely focused on finishing off the pizza, while the other flatmate tried to convince her to join their respective startups.\n\nOnce the pizza was over at around 11 PM, I took refuge in my room and resorted to what I do best - browsing the internet. Around 1 AM, when I came out for a glass of water, I noticed my flatmate (Shehla\'s friend) sleeping on the couch. \n\nWhen I asked him why wasn\'t he sleeping in the other room (we had 2 vacant), he said that few friends of Shehla had turned up at around midnight and they were sleeping there. I laughed out loudly and said, "Tumhari to Kashmiri Pandit wali halat ho gayi hain.

I often have a hard time caring about politics in India because I am somewhere in between on the political spectrum. Not left, not right - in between.\n\nI am:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Against appeasement of minorities and against a media culture that is 'politically correct' and fails to call out injustices committed by minorities because they may be 'opressed' or 'subjugated'. (Socially Right)\n2. For an Atmanirbhar and self-reliant Bharat that can stand up on it's own two feet. I deeply appreciate the initiatives taken with the PLI Schemes and snubbing the trade deals that could have brought us deeper into the economic orbit of China. (I think you would call this economically 'left'?)\n3. In favour of most of the economic initiatives of the government - GST was very much required to unify the tax chain; IBC is the silent reform that's saving the productive capacity of our country's industry in the background; and Demonetization struck a deep fear into the hearts of tax evaders that this country's leadership means business and the the old days of tax evasion are over. ('I think this is economically right'?)\n4. In favour of the Farm Laws and think that the farmers fail to understand that it is a good thing. I believe they have been made afraid by the traders and the concentration of protests in Punjab (and complete silence in South East and West India) is very fishy. (Right)\n5. (Conservative Trigger Warning) Against the Government's heavy handed move in Kashmir- I think the government has acted disproportionately in clamping down on dissent and putting the 'Gupkars' under house arrest. The suffocation of the internet in Kashmir is unfortunate and it only damages our reputation in the international community. The heavy handed clamping down makes it seem we are making an enemy of our own people. (Left)\n6. In support of the removal of Article 370 - I believe that Kashmir was economically and socially isolated from the rest of the country and bringing down the 'dysfunctional autonomy' was a long overdue move that could lead to deeper integration. (Right)\n7. In support of the treatment of Pakistan/China - Fuck Imran Khan and his Jihadi cronies. Fuck Xinnie the Flu and his CCP cronies. (Left or Right, just a Patriot here)\n8. In favour of 'true' Secularism - A complete separation of religion and State in all forms. That means Uniform Civil Code, dismantling of Hajj subsidies, tax breaks/subsidies to religious institution (even temples/mosques/churches/gurudwaras/agiaries should pay tax). I honestly find the Government getting involved in the Ram Temple construction very unfortunate. (Left)\n9. Against the suppression of dietary freedom - I love my beef and pork and I want to eat it without being subject to the fear that I will offend the government or my neighbour. (Left)\n10. Pro CAA/Anti-NRC - (For those who argue being Pro-CAA goes against my secularist beliefs - I believe as a country we owe it to those in our immediate neighborhood, who have historical and cultural links to our country, to protect their way of life from Jihadi governments. NRC is going to be a paperwork nightmare that will clog up the courts. (Bit of both)\n\nThere are a few others.. but I can't think of them right now.\n\nFinally, something that people may find a little extreme:\n\nI resent the Americo-Eurocentric world we live in. The West has made us speak their language, taken veto powers in all global institutions, controls the world economy and just exercises too much control over our well being. I believe in exchange for enslaving us for two centuries, the Western World owes us reparations (I believe Shashi Tharoor explains in a video).  They owe us reparations for burning all the fossil fuels before us and leaving us with the effect of global warming. They owe us reparations for using economic capital stolen from us over centuries of economic servitude and using that to grow their economies at our expense. \n\n**Goddamit I just want every statue of Winston Churchill to be burnt to ashes after I personally piss on each one of them.**\n\nWe need to reorient away from them, along with all other former colonised nations and build a future world that is suited to our requirements. We need to rebuild global institutions from the ground up (and leave current global institutions - what has the UN achieved anyway?). The IMF is just an elitist group of rich nations that likes to act as the world's moneylender. It forces poor countries to undertake painful austerity measures that leave them poorer than they started off, just to make their investors happy. I am not a racist, but when I mean 'Western World', I essentially mean all White People or 'White' nations.\n\nThat being said, I don't 'hate' the western world. I don't want their people to suffer or resent their culture. After all, I am typing in English right? **I just think there is a giant bill for past mistakes and they need to pay their dues.** We should also team up with other developing countries and with our bargaining power, extract concessions. \n\nT[his is what I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeWn3Sso2RE), - just imagine India and other developed countries instead of Canada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To sum it off, my political beliefs are a bit 'weird' and as a result I don't have a 'political home' in India.** \n\n  \n**Where do you stand on the political spectrum?**"<br />Author: 'redindian_92'  id: 'k491lp'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k491lp/i_find_myself_politically_lost_in_india_where_are/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Shashi Tharoor on Kerala's Exceptionalism &amp; Indian's Predisposition to Docility"<br />Body: 'I recently came across a Shashi Tharoor[ interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj8tkSeZk-I) with ScoopWhoop, and as with most of his interviews, it was a delightful and illuminating watch (though the host seemed to have a limited understanding of the subject matter). But, the reason this interview warrants a specific reddit post is Tharoor\'s brilliant impromptu exposition of Kerala\'s exceptionalism and Indian\'s predisposition to docility, or as Tharoor likes to call it, \'exaggerated deference to hierarchy.\' I\'ve gone to the trouble of extracting these remarks and have created this essay of sorts:\n\n"Kerala is a fairly strong civil society, and civil society is able to articulate its demands well and act as a pressure group on the government. So, how do you create that culture of democracy, and is there something that can be replicated in the rest of India? Kerala is such an outlier and such an exception in so many ways that I am hesitant to generalize on that model. I remember visiting my former party colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia at his invitation in his constituency. And when I saw the somewhat lordly manner, in which he was treating his constituents, tossing the garlands they gave him out on the streets and the kind of bowing that took place. I said to him almost with a smile don\'t come to Kerala, you\'d be deeply disappointed because, in Kerala, the public believes you\'re working for them. They don\'t come to you with folded hands asking for favors. They come to tell you what they want and expect you to fulfill it and judge you if you don\'t fulfill it. It\'s a totally different world when I compare it to the rest of Indian politics. Partly because a very intensely democratic and egalitarian culture has grown up over a long period. It\'s not an accident, for example, the first Dalit reformer in India was a Keralite, Mahatama Ayyankali. Who predates Ambedkar by a couple of generations. Education and literacy is part of it, Kerala is a first place in the world, not just in India, in the world to have decreed universal free and compulsory primary education for both boys and girls going back to 1870. At that time even in the UK, US, and other western countries, girls were not eligible for free compulsory universal primary education, but they were in Kerala. So, you have got this kind of a tradition going back way before the recent democratic rule.\n\nAnd that’s why democracy is so deeply entrenched in kerala and that\'s why the Kerala workers have perhaps an exaggerated sense of their rights. But certainly, as a result, the best minimum wage in India, the most advanced panoply of workers\' rights in India. You have got a very strongly vigorous civil society in a democracy. In Kerala, there are somewhere like thirteen 24x7 channels. There\'s one that is pro-communism, there\'s one that is pro-BJP, there\'s one that is pro-Congress and the rest are completely free, robustly independent, and curry no fear or favor of any of these parties, they will attack them all. So, you have really got a tremendously vigorous democratic environment. And that\'s why I find it particularly difficult to replicate, I won\'t say it is not replicable. it should be replicable in states with a good education because literacy is a major factor. So, Goa, Delhi, Chandigarh, etc should be able to implement similar approaches. But it requires also a will at the top. It requires people in positions of power to actually come back to the people and offer them transparency, accountability, respect, and so on. I think part of the problem is that the culture of many parts of India is still a little behind where Kerala\'s is. In terms, very simple, I think what is wrongly called, is feudal. It’s a pattern of society, I think that\'s not really feudal in the old sense, but **there is exaggerated deference to hierarchy. The tradition of deference to seniority, to rank, to age, to caste, etc. brings with it a certain willingness to be dictated to a certain extent. And the expectation from the people at the top of the ladder that they can give order down below and it will be followed.**\n\nWhy was Kerala soil more fertile for this than other places in India? The principal factor is literacy but there is also openness. Openness because of two and a half thousand years of recorded exchanges with other parts of the world, the seacoast, the travels to the middle east, to the Arab world, and so on. Openness to ideas, open to influences. You know, Kerala has the oldest Jewish community outside Palestine. It has the oldest Christian community outside Palestine. It has the oldest Muslim community outside the Arab peninsula. Because all these people came to Kerala. Friendly waters of the Arabian sea and the friendly maritime winds brought them there centuries before christ and so you have this constant pattern of engagement. And openness and acceptance of difference and acceptance of different ways of doing things. All of which has created an extraordinarily cosmopolitan society."\n\nPS - If you agree or disagree, in either case, would love to hear any contradictions, extensions of the essay\'s proposition, or just any thoughts in general!'<br />Author: 'Acceptable_Log_935'  id: 'k424v0'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k424v0/shashi_tharoor_on_keralas_exceptionalism_indians/</li>

How I studied hard to cram the ideas based on a Moral Code based on these concepts: Heaven, Hell, Sin, Angel, Edicts, Devil, Dark Side, Satan, Believers, Infidels, Blasphemy, Prophet, GOD!'<br />Body: 'Did you study "Moral Science" in a Christian Missionary school like I did?  A full 100 marks from Class 3-9 (or something like that). \n\nHow I studied hard to cram the ideas that by imbibing a Moral Code based on these concepts:\n\n**Heaven, Hell, Sin, Angel, Edicts, Devil, Dark Side, Satan, Believers, Infidels, Blasphemy, Prophet** and finally a **moral, omniscient and omnipotent God** who Sees us and Knows us and has a Plan for us.\n\nWe can rise to a higher sense of Morality and duty by following his commandments and ascend to Heaven.\n\nAs I grew older I felt no need for any God or Religion - intellectually or spirituality or emotionally  or did I ever feel any evidence of the Devil or Satan. In fact they stood out as impediments to my developing spirituality and my developing intellect and my expansive reading verified they are also  unscientific (no evidence...material or spiritual)\n\nNo scientific evidence ever found, no hypothesis proven except by Belief nor did one ever feel these concepts naturally or through any spiritual experience until it was injected into their minds. \n\nTo wrap your conditioned mind around Dharma/Taoism/Unity of Truth, I had to excise (get rid of, completely forever and truly) these Abrahamic imports from my entire vocabulary:\n\n**Heaven, Hell, Sin, Angel, Edicts, Devil, Dark Side, Satan, Believers, Infidels, Blasphemy, Prophet and finally a moral omniscient and omnipotent God.**\n\nWho created these concepts and why? Priests did. The goal of the Priests was to create the illusion of the Dark Side so they could offer you salvation by following their religion to come out into the Light. \n\nAbrahamic religions demand full obedience to the unverifiable doctrine, even if it goes against one\'s conscience. That is why they had to create these ideas as a political means employed in the service of religion.\n\nAbrahamic Religions - Christianity and Islam - are not based on Dharma. Dharma/Taoism/Unity of Truth is in tune with one\'s conscience and evidenced by hard science in THE UNIVERSE (such as Quantum Dynamics and Relativity). \n\nMost "pagan" religions are not based on this false dichotomy either such as Native American religions and Vedanta - (Advaita is based on Duality). \n\nDharma/Taoism/Unity of Truth simple teaches you how to see the Universe again as WHOLE before "Moral Science" and Abrahamic concepts created by Priests and subtly injected into a innocent young mind stopped you from seeing the WHOLENESS of CREATION in search of good marks and appreciation by parents and teachers.\n\nFrom early childhood our consciousness was split into 2, its WHOLENESS destroyed by these concepts created by Priests. From this the young mind never recovers, everything they experience later as Right or Wrong, Allowed and Disallowed, Legal or Illegal, Good or Bad? That the division has altered the structure of perception so deeply that you can only fit all new experiences into one or the other? And they can never be joined back like Humpty Dumpty?\n\nWhen they encounter ideas like Taoism/Unity of Truth/Advaita Vedanta, they laugh like it is Voodoo? They laughs out loud. It is the most Ridiculous thing he has heard! And yet it was his Dharma, it existed for thousands of years and it was suppressed by his Abrahamic Religious - influenced upbringings surreptitiously injecting this ideas into his perception in the near universal influence of these religions but never explicitly "religious"!\n\nInteresting how "Moral Science" was never part of ICSE or any Board Approved examinations and ended in Class 9 just before ICSE!'<br />Author: 'pras'  id: 'k41ojf'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k41ojf/did_you_study_moral_science_in_a_missionary/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Petroleum jelly – an instant fix but not a long last relief'<br />Body: " Petroleum jelly often known by the name Vaseline is the cheapest available source of moisturising the dry – flaky skin has  in fact made its way to interiors of many countries.\n\nThe petroleum jelly or Vaseline is a by-product of the oil industry, found in oil rigs. The jelly packed in jars &amp; bottles is refined to remove the carcinogenic components from it to make it suitable for skin care application. However one doesn’t really know to what extent the unsuitable –harmful components have been removed as there are multiple grade petroleum jelly available in the market.\n\nPetroleum jelly and other petroleum derived products like mineral oil, liquid paraffin, petroleum jelly etc is an ingredient to many [skin care](https://www.snaana.com/) products ranging from baby to adult to healing balms and ointments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[snaana.com](https://preview.redd.it/v8k0esizwc261.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c403bf71ebfe2945fb808df1ba21c6144d7a83d9)\n\n**The moisturising petroleum jelly may provide an instant but not a long last relief.**\n\nThe jelly with impermeable properties creates a layer that traps the water/moisture beneath the skin giving a time being fixed of moisturised skin feel &amp; appearance. So in a way you may feel the instant smooth and softened surface but in reality the skin pores are dried out keeping away the air &amp; moisture. Do not forget, with water, it seals all the dirt &amp; bacteria too which may create a conducive environment for bacterial growth causing inflammation and possibly a deep rooted acne/pimple. Therefore people with oily acne prone skin and rosacea skin condition have never felt petroleum jelly as a suitable moisturizing product for their skin.\n\nPeople usually have the tendency to use the same external skin moisturising product to cater to the dryness of different body parts like nostrils, oral care and even the genital areas.  Think, applying regularly in a nostril to ease dryness can get the product to the lung causing a concern like lipid pneumonia. Application of petroleum jelly or mineral oil around the nose area in children may cause aspiration pneumonia. It does not have any moisturising ability of its own rather it sets itself between cells in our lipid barrier and holds the moisture under the applied layer. It is always good to look for healthy ingredients than to resort to cheap quick fix solutions.\n\nThe best way to keep away petroleum derived ingredients in our day to day life is to shift to healthy alternatives like beeswax, shea butter, [cocoa butter](https://www.snaana.com/natural-body-moisturizer-with-avo-cocoa), [coconut oil](https://www.snaana.com/pure-coconut-oil), olive oil, [sesame oil](https://www.snaana.com/pure-sesame-oil) etc.\n\nAs the winters approach, the look and search for dryness catering products increases manifold with vaseline or any other brand petroleum jelly, being inexpensive becomes an inevitable- impulse buy. \n\nIt's better to avoid all petroleum derived ingredients and only petroleum jelly alone since these are derived from crude toxic oil, may harm the body and also pose sustainable and eco friendly concerns."<br />Author: 'snaana_'  id: 'k3tm5k'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k3tm5k/petroleum_jelly_an_instant_fix_but_not_a_long/</li>

I returned to my place a short while back and tried a brand that I hadn't in a while. And I was left speechless. I'm referring to Vadilal ice-creams. It was nothing short of an epicurean extravaganza. Left my senses awakened, face luminous and heart content. I remember relishing their ice-creams as a kid. \n\nOver the years developed a liking for some other brands, switched cities and somehow this slipped my mind. After trying it again I started reading some literature on its history and it swept me off my feet. Here's a company that's been operational for more than a century now. Associated is inestimable heritage and despite that just not enough people have had the opportunity to enjoy their nectars of exquisite flavors. \n\nTheir audacity to try new combinations left me awe-struck. Noteworthy is their 'Shahi Kalakand' flavour. It seamless combines calm repose and blissful indulgence.

      <li>Title::: "A friend narrating about his family's experience in Punjab during 80s and 90s."<br />Body: 'Most will dislike this post. I stay in North India. Whenever I went to work to Punjab it was not uncommon for me to see posters of Bhrindanwale everywhere. Militancy does not exist because it has been suppressed brutally. Not because people left their support for it. \n\nIt took years after 1984 to flush the terrorists out. My Punjabi Hindu friends used to say that their neighbors used to hate them for being Hindus. My parents used to be shit scared in those days since we lived in the border town. Honestly, despite being useless, it was not uncommon for people to look upto the Congress when there was a threat of Sikh extremism. The Congress were motivated by vendetta but then all other parties used to turn a blind eye towards the Hindu victims of Sikh extremism. Even the BJP does not dare take it up because it would spoil its narrative of Sikh Hindu unity (but no one buys it in Punjab,therefore Hindus generally incline towards the Congress, Sikhs towards SAD).\n\nDownvote me to hell and beyond,won\'t change my stance. Have been abused all my life by BJP supporters because the lived experiences of our parents disturbed the romanticised myth of Hindu Sikh Unity. We would not have lived in fear if there was this unity. On facebook day in and day out you would see Sikhs abusing Hindu gods. On the contrary we Hindus hold a high reverence for Sikh gurus. However, this respect is NEVER reciprocated. I know this comment might break your lalaland but we won\'t be held hostage to your idealistic dreams. Hindus were bombed from the sky, pulled out from busses and massacred while many were raped. However, all the RSS could do was preach "brotherhood" while in reality people were being burnt and flayed alive. It is true that Indira Gandhi was a jerk but it is also true that the previous generation of ours (Punjabis and Non Punjabi Hindus) supported her because she cared for the sufferings of minorities in Punjab, unlike the BJP which likes to paper over it while calling us liars.\n\nHindu Punjabis are left alone by their own Hindus either as  Majority which happens to be a minority in one province by the Liberals who focus on propagating Sikhism as a humanistic religion and also by the Hindutva Hindus who see us as an anathema to their rosy utopian future. For we must either shut up or should simply cease to exist for both of these groups. \n\nFor the Liberals, I understand this, since Hindus are seen as evil castist pricks and therefore anything against them goes. However I could not wrap the support which Khalistanis get form the BJP.'<br />Author: 'queerfem'  id: 'k3orm4'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k3orm4/a_friend_narrating_about_his_familys_experience/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Iranian nuclear scientist assassinated, lonely elephant freed in Islamabad zoo, and the story of Gaddafi'<br />Body: ' Welcome to another edition of the Geopolitics thread, where we discuss the latest news from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India - please share stories that caught your attention in the comments. Here are some stories to start the conversation: \n\n# Top 5 stories\n\n1. [Iran\'s top nuclear scientist assassinated allegedly by Israel](https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-calculated-response-nuclear-scientist-killed-newspaper-attack-israeli-city-haifa)\n\nIran\'s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who has led the country\'s illicit nuclear weapons program for two decades, was assassinated in a military-style ambush outside of Tehran, complete with a bomb-laden truck and armed gunmen. The shocking and bold move has been blamed by Iranian authorities on the Israeli spy agency, Mossad, and possibly support from the CIA. In terms of impact on Iran\'s strategic programme, it it as significant as the assassination of Iranian General Qassim Soleimani by the US earlier this year. Iran has vowed to retaliate, with one pro-government newspaper suggesting an attack on the Israeli port city of Haifa.\n\n2. [Football legend Diego Maradona dies, foul play suspected](https://sports.yahoo.com/diego-maradonas-doctor-being-investigated-for-possible-manslaughter-following-soccer-legends-death-202459845.html)\n\nFootball legend Diego Maradona died of a hear attack in his home in  Buenos Aires, Argentina of a heart attack at the age of 60. This happened barely weeks after he underwent surgery to relieve a brain hemorrhage. The family has alleged that his doctor, Dr.  Leopoldo Luque, was negligent in his post-operation care, which led to the untimely death. Police raided the doctor\'s home, but he has offered to cooperate and insists that he did the best he could.\n\n3. [Kaavan, lonely elephant, freed from Islamabad zoo](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/animal-news/world-s-loneliest-elephant-starts-trip-sanctuary-cambodia-n1249271)\n\n Following years of public outcry and a major push by American singer Cher, authorities in Islamabad\'s zoo have released Kaavan, the zoo\'s lone elephant (after his partner Saheli died in 2012) that was living a lonely life under conditions that were so poor that the Islamabad High Court had ordered the zoo shut in August after 90% of its animals had died. Elephants, like humans, are social animals, and the isolation left deep mental scars in addition to physical scars from the shoddy zoo. Now, Kaavan is being relocated to a wildlife reserve in Cambodia, complete with 3 female Asiatic elephants for company. He was a gift to the Islamabad zoo from Sri Lanka.\n\n4. [Ethiopia declares victory in Tigray region](https://www.foxnews.com/world/ethiopia-declares-victory-tigray-capital)\n\nEthiopian federal forces took control of  Mekele, the capital of the Tigray region where mutinous federal soldiers had joined local militia to rebel against the state several weeks ago. The capture prompted Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Laureate  Abiy Ahmed to declare victory, although the exact number of casualties from bombing of civilian areas remains unknown. Over 40,000 people fled to neighbouring Sudan as a result of the fighting.\n\n5. [Trump continues to challenge US election without success](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8996829/Trump-declares-team-massive-proof-fraud-illegality-Pennsylvania.html)\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his campaign continued efforts to overturn election results in several states in an attempt to claw back a victory from Democrat Joe Biden. However, his team has had no success. Several cases and rounds of appeals in Pennsylvania saw the cases dismissed by courts with harsh rebukes for their vague claims and pleas to declare the entire election null and void. In Michigan, the campaign spent $3 mn for a recount in the Detroit region that led to Biden\'s margin increasing. However, the Trump campaign is confident that it will go to the US Supreme Court and win the election, somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The rise and fall of Col. Gaddafi\n\nIn the ongoing series on post-colonial African dictators, readers would think that only the former British colonies had it bad. But the truth is that Africa as a whole has had a shaky relationship with democracy. We have seen how dictators used opposing ideologies - from Communism to capitalism - to justify their control of the state. However, there was a third ideology as well - political Islamism, the idea that the "protector of the faith" would be the dictator of the country. Perhaps the most famous of this lot was the former dictator of Libya, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. \n\nLibya is an old region - it was once part of the Roman Empire, then came under the control of the Islamic Caliphate, then the Ottoman Empire, and then under the Italian Empire. After Italy\'s defeat in WW2, it was ruled by an old monarch. Under this regime, a young Gaddafi studied at a madarsa where, in addition to religious teachings, he was exposed to the Arab Nationalist movement led by another dictator, Nasser of Egypt (who co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement with Nehru,  and fellow dictators Tito and Sukarno). He later joined the Libyan Army. In 1969, Gaddafi and several officers launched a bloodless coup and abolished the monarchy, establishing the Libyan Arab Republic, although it was led by the Revolutionary Command Council, a dictatorship led by Gaddafi.\n\nGaddafi immediately moved to expel Italian and Jewish settlers and nationalized the country\'s lucrative oil industry. Libya is one of the world\'s largest producers of oil and it is the country\'s primary export. Gaddafi sought to channel oil profits to education and human development - and it worked. Libya\'s per capita GDP rose from just $40 in 1951 to $8,170 in 1979, ten years after Gaddafi took over. On the social side, he declared sharia as the law of the country, but also made several progressive reforms such as raising the marriage age for women and doubling the country\'s minimum wage. \n\nHowever, Gaddafi increasingly started creating a cult around his personality in the mid-1970s. His so-called Green Book outlined his Third International Theory, which was similar to Mao\'s revolutionary ideas except that he put Islam and himself at the center of it, reversing many of the progressive gains that he had made earlier. He established a secret police as well as student organizations to flush out dissidents, who were hanged; many of these includes Islamic clerics that disagreed with Gaddafi\'s Marxist economics. In 1977, he dissolved the state to found the "Great Socialist People\'s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" with himself as the "Great Revolutionary Leader" with dictatorial powers. \n\nBut more than domestic policy, Gaddafi was perhaps best-known for his foreign policy. Libya began supporting revolutionary militia all around the world and especially in Africa, turning it into a pariah state. US President Ronald Raegan ordered naval exercises in what Libya claimed to be its territorial waters; as a result, several Libyan aircraft and ships were shot down by the Americans. Libya was accused of targeted assassinations around the world, including in Berlin and London. However, by the 1980s, prolonged sanctions and American attacks had weakened Gaddafi\'s control, and he launched a so-called "revolution within a revolution," reversing much of his socialist policies and clipping the wings of his own regime (except himself, of course). However, he continued with his revolutionary foreign policy, blowing up PanAm flight 103 en route to Lockerbie in Scotland, and attempting to acquire nuclear weapons through Pakistan\'s AQ Khan network.\n\nIt was only at the dawn of the 21st century that Gaddafi tried to turn a new corner. He dropped his cause for Arab and Muslim unity in favour of African Unity, began rebuilding ties with the West, and ended his nuclear programme. He began massive privatization and reform of his economy, rejecting his own socialism. And, while he publicly supported sharia, he put clerics on a very short leash and refused to allow any Islamic fundamentalist movements to grow. These moves saw massive foreign investment into Libya, and while there was no political freedom, people started doing well economically. It seemed that Gaddafi would not just be a dictator, but a popular one at that, till he died.\n\nAnd then came the Arab Spring, when protests against lack of political freedom broke out. While Gaddafi suppressed these initially through massive force, US President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a "coalition of the willing," of which France was a major player. This coalition joined the Libyan Civil War, tipping the scales towards rebel groups. In October 2011, Gaddafi was found dead after major fighting in a sewage pipe. After his death, Libya plunged into a civil war, with ISIS and Al Qaeda joining either side and creating a massive refugee crisis in Europe, particularly the former colonial master, Italy. Oil production virtually came to a halt, and the country today remains partitioned between various factions, even being used by Turkish President Erdogan in his wars as a proxy battleground.\n\n Gaddafi\'s legacy remains mixed. He was a political tyrant, but is often seen as both a chaste Muslim and an economic liberalizer (greased with oil money, of course). He branded his economic policies as "Islamic socialism" - the mantle of which has been taken over by Pakistani PM Imran Khan today. Indeed, Gaddafi remains popular in the subcontinent\'s second-largest country, with Gaddafi stadium being a popular cricket venue in Lahore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'k3lskw'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k3lskw/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_iranian/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I love Christianity and Islam, but I have a problem with POLITICIZED Christian Missionaries and Muslim Missionaries.'<br />Body: 'Christianity and Islam has brought billions of people a beautiful path to spirituality and **prajna** (pure wisdom). I have many loved ones in these two great religions, and I, myself, have benefitted greatly from them. \n\nHowever, I\'m in the USA, and I\'ve seen first hand how [80% of ** white evangelical voters have overlooked Trump\'s affiliation with pornography actors, his failed marriages, all his extra marital affairs, his associations with pedophiles (Jeffrey Epstein), and much more.**](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/08/932263516/2020-faith-vote-reflects-2016-patterns) I have also seen how many Christian Missions in India are sponsored by Americans who have a long-term time horizon than we do. I even have a second-cousin from the South who\'s married to a white Christian girl, and her family is very devout. She even has 2 brothers converting people in Bihar. My sister-in-law is a sweetheart, but her dad voted for Trump. \n\nAnyways, my ancestral village is in Tamil Nadu, and we\'ve had Muslims, Hindus, Atheists with surnames like "Lenin", and Christians always there living side by side in harmony. In the last 3 decades, my village is now 40% Christians, and they have very English sounding names and **not Aramaic or Hebrew names, but American English names.**. \n\nMoreover, these Christians as well as Korean-American Christians, Chinese-American Christians, Vietnamese Christians, and any new Asian Christians all seem to be brainwashed American Christians with a suspicion to their Pre-Christian selves and a blinding loyalty to the Republican Party of the USA. \n\nThere are some Muslims in India that are similar, but this is more apparent in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the Madrasas there are funded with Saudi money and they teach students to be Wahhabi Muslims. \n\nHowever, we were always familiar and aware of the Wahhabi lobbying in South Asia, and I had never suspected that there was a nefarious American "supply-side materialistic" Christianity religion that was lobbying in India which advocated selfishness, fielty towards a white American, loyalty to American expansionism (as long as it benefits the whites), and it\'s setting us up for colonialization in the future once again. \n\nFinally, it seems that Indian Christians and Indian Muslims volunteer themselves as servants to the Americans and Saudis, respectively. Other Christian and Muslim nations are allowed to imbue their influence and culture on their respected religions, but Indians are not allowed to imbue their culture or heritage onto Christianity or Islam. Examples: Christianity allows for pagan Saxon traditions of Christmas Tree, Egyptian tradition of Easter Egg, and also other myths to be incorporated into their religion. Islam allowed for many different sects, like Ismaili to flourish in South Asia and Yemen, and Iran is allowed to be their own Shia group. \n\nHowever, in spite of having over 230,000,000 Muslims and Christians in India (about 88% of these are Muslims), their impact on their global identity is non-existent, as if they\'re third class citizens. \n\nI personally think that a third-rate white Christian in Alabama without a degree has more status than an Indian Christian with a PhD in theology.\n\nI personally think that Indians need to highly regulate their movements and counter their influence. \n\nWhat do you think about these American Missionaries?'<br />Author: 'Sorry-Operation'  id: 'k3flri'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k3flri/i_love_christianity_and_islam_but_i_have_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The problem with Anti-Conversion Bill - A conflict of interpretations of law'<br />Body: "Been doing some reading recently, and Keeping it brief as fuck:\n\n**Special Marriage act:**\n\n**Word of the law (paraphrasing, Layman language) :**\n\n*  You consider yourself atheists/ when getting married.\n* You post your intent to marry at yours and partner's local area (notice board of MC, etc), and have to wait for 1 month. \n* Anyone who know either party and feels either partner is not mentally or otherwise has capacity to continue marriage, can object and stall the marriage.\n\n**How it is implemented:**\n\n* The notice is used to notify parents (who are usually against such marriages). \n* Anyone can raise a seemingly absurd objection and can stall the marriage, causing more of these religio-political groups to intervene. \n\nTrivia: I read that this was something Nehru and Ambedkar fought tooth and nail just to get something through. Ambedkar quit parliament permanently, while Nehru worked on getting this weak-ass law (Something better than nothing) type.\n\n**Alternative way of marriage:**\n\n**From the above law and elsewhere:**\n\n* Mixed religious (abhramic-Dharmic, etc) marriages are **void** if the partners are of different religions. \n* At the very least, if one partner converts to the same religion of the other - then marriage can happen today, you can register tomorrow with all suitable documents. You will need 2 witnesses. \n\n**How it is implemented:**\n\n* As long as the partner has an affidavit which says they are converting (you dont need any ceremony), you can literally get it at a notary - it is enough for marriage. \n* While registering, the government babus will pressure you for getting parents and/or family as witnesses (to get bribe), and if you are able to resolve that, you'll get registered without the necessarily the families knowing. \n\n**The Anti-Conversion Bill:**\n\n**From the Law:**\n\n* It obstructs the above flaw in the law that creates coerced, fake or Love-Jihad/GharWapsi marriages - who secretly get married and are left in the lurch if it was a one-sided scam.\n* It also prevents the only way true love-based couples with different religions can ever get married without the whole society intervening. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the law attempts to prevent cheating marriages - it has very clearly solidified the communal divide by disallowing any mixed couples to get married in any way (that's not troublesome) whatsoever as a side-effect.\n\nThis actually makes us go back several decades in violating personal freedoms. Even genuine love couples with mixed background cannot get married now. In attempting to prevent a social problem, it has effectively closed the door for a lot of social progress, and very tightly. \n\n**Summary**: Religion prevents interfaith marriage of a love couple (**Inter-religious marriage is void in India**), Anti-conversion bill prevents converting (in any form) to solve this problem. \n\nSo, basically, start looking at your partner of a different faith as a different species, and consideration of marriage wit them similar to beastiality. Because now you're allowed to still fuck, but cant get married without the whole society breaking your backs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: None for now"<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'k3a3iv'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k3a3iv/the_problem_with_anticonversion_bill_a_conflict/</li>

Check out [Powertrain\'s Infranews playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExihItDPEw&amp;list=PLDwKIc0IygJ3OJ-eYL2Rrw2vAQIEpH1UI). **I want to say that I am not Powertrain**.\n\n**Update list of infrastructure projects:**\n\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Comparing China vs India\n\nAround the time of independence, China came out of the civil war which was about 20 years and the communist rule under Mao Zedong. India came out of several hundred years of Islamic invasions AND 200 years of British Colonialism, of which resulted in [many famines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule) and that the [British looted $45 trillion from India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/british-looted-45-trillion-from-india-in-todays-value-jaishankar/articleshow/71426353.cms).\n\n**Economic comparison:**\n\nWhen people compare India and China, they compare by GDP per capita and such. [In 1990, India\'s GDP per capita was $367.56 then in 2018 it was $2009.98. China\'s GDP per capita was $317.88 in 1990 and then rose to $9770.85 in 2018.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)\n\nWhat no one takes into consideration was when India and China did economic reforms. China did this in 1978, India started their process in 1991. When the economic processes started, we will call this **Year 0**. So China has experienced **42** years of economic reforms and then India has experienced **29** years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||**China**|**India**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Year 0**|$156.40|$303.06|\n|**Year 27**|$1753.42|$2009.98|\n\nTable: [GDP Per capita](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)\n\nSo as shown, in 27 years China has increased by $1597.02 while India has improved by $1706.92 as shown by the above table.\n\nChina also started like us, starting with assembling and slowly moving up the value chains. Look at them now. They do many things better than India currently but in time, it should improve.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Against the Brain Drain Narrative\n\nIndia has [about 32 million NRIs and PIOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin). There are those that emigrate or were born in these countries due to British moving Indian labourers to work during the shitty colonial times. Such as Fiji.\n\nNow from my observations, not everyone who leaves India is necessarily a brain drain. Many of those who go to Arab countries for labour work. Im sure Indians know about the labour camps they have there. These people remit money back to India. [India has the largest remittance in the world with $69 billion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance).\n\nAlso, it can kind of benefit India in a way of these people leaving. For example, spreading cuisines, people taking interest in Bollywood, Diwali, Holi and more. Except those that are those NRIs who think they\'re superior and loathing. The NRIs I know of like India but are just here to have a simpler lifestyle and to remit money back. My parents plan to move back to India and my parents left cause my dad isn\'t fond of his parents.\n\nMore points against Brain Drain:\n\n* [India ranked 9th in TOTAL scientific papers](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php)\n   * Ranked 13th in 1996\n   * Ranked 11th in 2006\n   * Ranked 4th in 2019\n* [With 50,000 startups registered, India aims for as many more by 2024](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/with-50000-startups-registered-india-aims-for-as-many-more-by-2024/articleshow/71440117.cms)\n* [Labour force is about 500 million people.

Again, barely scraped the surface when it comes to science. Then we have many companies investing into India, providing jobs and benefiting the country as well.\n\nAlso, I know that the number of NRIs and PIOs are 32 million. India labour force is 500 million. So that means 6.4% of the labour force left India. According to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k2kskg/indians_top_the_list_of_educated_migrants_in_rich/), there are 3.12 million highly educated migrants. So thats 0.624% of India\'s labour force.\n\nAnd again **If India is improving, does brain drain heavily impact the country? Isn\'t it still improving?**\n\nIm probs gonna get bashed for this section but idc. This is truth. Those who leave don\'t necessarily cause brain drain. Me for example (I plan to move back cause I hate australia)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# My Views and Experiences\n\nBelow is some of my opinions. I just wanna say I am technically an NRI and I was raised in America, living in  Australia. Though I consider myself [ABCD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/iu8m3q/indians_born_in_india_vs_abcds/)\n\n**My personal experience in seeing manufacturing**: I live in Australia. In Sydney the metro trains that were made were made in Chennai. Here is a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cnt9he/a_while_ago_i_saw_a_post_about_how_india_made_the/) for that of which I posted. Very nice trains. When I went to India, I got a OnePlus phone (gonna say that this was before the boycotting. Im not getting rid of my phone that i paid for) that was assembled in  India. Then here in Australia, theres heaps of medicines that are made in India. I buy my clothes in India and they were all made there except for a small amount of shirts.\n\n**What needs to be done**:  Need to build roads, roads and more roads. Roads that are paved that  too. Roads are the underlying foundation of a country. This needs more work.\n\nInvestment in ports, airports and more. I will say however airports are now heaps good in India. I remember Mumbai airport being utterly trash before the new terminal came. This is both domestic and international. I also went to Delhi airport and saw how massive and nice it was. Even the outside  area was impressive.\n\n**THE COUNTRY IS NOT DOOMED.** To the doomers, [OK DOOMER](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1411973-doomer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope you enjoyed this post. Please feel free to comment more links of investment that I might have missed. I posted this due to my desire to share information.

No one can become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled because he is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRef : Bhagavad-Gita 6.8, Purport, Srila Prabhupada\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a82zg2em3z161.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592be1613fc22a4c6e258e44186083a589c5b581\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 6.7'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What is samādhi ? How one can acheive this transcendental state ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone\'s heart as Paramātmā. When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one\'s mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one\'s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramātmā or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical samādhi, or absorption in the Supreme."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 6.7, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x24keznvhs161.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e73344ca74da019a47463bcf573827d33b8dff3\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'What was the objective of Pakistan in the 26/11 attacks? I have explained it in detail here. (this was first posted as a comment which went viral and many asked me to post here)'<br />Body: "There are multiple reasons.\n\nIndia had been accusing Pakistan of state-sponsored terrorism since 1980s but the world was not taking it seriously and was instead treating both countries equally. But that all changed after 9/11 incident after which it became increasingly difficult for the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to get away with terrorism as many countries started pointing fingers at it.\n\nSo, ironically, they thought the best idea to combat this is if they can show that India also does terrorism thus levelling the playing field.\n\nTo do that, they send 10 terrorists to Mumbai at night secretly by hijacking a local fishing boat. These 10 terrorists were to die as Indian Hindus. They had fake ID cards in the Indian Names in their pockets. They even wore sacred hand bands worn by religious Hindus. \\[[source](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/10-id-cards-of-26/11-attackers-carrying-hindu-names-were-fake-ujjawal-nikam/articleshow/74219450.cms)\\]\n\nSo, the idea was to make it look like an Indian-Hindu Terrorist attack \\[[source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2611-would-have-been-called-hindu-terror-attack-says-rakesh-maria/article30856076.ece)\\] where Hindus are attacking rich foreigners in five star hotels, thus creating a bad name for India. They had thought once these 10 terrorists die in Mumbai, and the bodies will show evidence that they were Hindus, thus no connection to Pakistan at all.\n\nTheir plans got foiled because one terrorist was caught alive albeit with great sacrifice. One unarmed Police officer named [Tukaram Omble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukaram_Omble) jumped and grabbed one terrorist's Ak-47 pointed towards him. He got shot 40 times at point-blank range but he kept holding the gun. He died immediately but this helped other policemen who were also unarmed to catch this heavily armed terrorist alive. \\[This cop was awarded India's highest gallantry award\\]\n\nThis terrorist later confessed everything and gave out a lot of details(you can see it in this documentary). Apart from that, later the Indian intelligence was able to track and record the conversation between the terrorists and their handlers in Pakistan.(again watch the documentary to hear it)\n\nThe **secondary objective** was to initiate a Hindu-Muslim civil war within India thus destabilize the country.\n\nWith **tertiary objectives** probably being to defame the country and thus reduce foreigners from going there and reducing investments in India.  Pakistan was getting zero investment from foreign companies at that time due to terrorism and instability while India was getting plenty, so they probably wanted to stop that by attacking the financial capital of India.\n\nBUT, the **biggest objective** is to stop India and Pakistan from becoming friends. This is because Pakistan is a military dictatorship with a puppet civilian government. When there are no issues, India often shows a hand of friendship and the Pak civilian government sometimes supports it. The dictator cannot afford a friendship between India and Pakistan as that would render the military irrelevant and thus they lose power.\n\nSo, whenever India and Pakistan gets too friendly, you can be sure that a terrorist strike is about to happen as that will destroy that relation. These kinda terrorist strikes have happened every time they both got friendly, and this time also, they were getting close. Just for examples\n\n1. 1999 - Indian pm travelled to Pak crossing border in a public bus and was welcomed by pak PM. They both were acting like buddies and friendship was  assured. Then [Kargil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War) happened. When Indian PM called Pak PM on phone to discuss this backstabbing, he was not even aware that PAK soldiers had attacked India and captured few mountain ranges.\n2. 2001 - Again India and pak got too close and then [2001 Indian Parliament attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Indian_Parliament_attack) happened.\n3. 2008 - India Amen ki Asha project. Both getting too close. Then this mumbai 26/11 happened.\n4. 2016 - India Pak was getting too friendly. Indian PM Modi event went to Pakistan PM's daughter's wedding. Within two weeks Pathankot terrorist attack happened.\n\nAfter all these, message was clear for India that getting friendly to Pakistan means a terrorist attack and the current Indian Government official policy is to not do dialogue with Pakistan as it is futile, as real power is with the Army dictatorship. Peace is only possible if this dictatorship is broken. I wish if the Pakistani public get the courage and start a massive revolution and solve this problem for once and all."<br />Author: 'Fdsn'  id: 'k1wdck'<br />Score:877<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k1wdck/what_was_the_objective_of_pakistan_in_the_2611/</li>

Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. He sees everything-whether it be pebbles, stones or gold-as the same.**\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**PURPORT**\n\n.\n\nBook knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. This is stated as follows:\n\n.\n\nataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥsevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.\n\n.\n\n"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." (Padma Purāṇa)\n\n.\n\nThis Bhagavad-gītā is the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No one can become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled because he is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.\n\n.\n\n**Questions 1 : How a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is different from the one who is advanced in mere academic or mundane knowledge ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter - 6: Sankhya-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/6g90el2rpp161.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=568ef408836a3e4ec91a9e2521492541e2fb0ff7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'k1ujjt'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k1ujjt/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is68/</li>

Prolonged /chronic stress can affect overall well-being and raise concerns like obesity, heart unease, blood pressure, weight loss, diabetes, and much varying from the body to body.\n\nSkin is a mirror to our internal body concerns, stress shows up on the skin too in different forms like [acne – pimples](https://www.snaana.com/acne-oily-skin-care-regime-products), rashes, hormonal imbalance, [psoriasis,](https://www.snaana.com/eczema-psoriasis-ayurvedic-treatment) eczema, rosacea, dull &amp; dehydrated, and much more.  The concerns appearing on the skin further stress us impacting/deteriorating the overall body.\n\nManaging stress is very important to keep the skin healthy and flawless. Using the different product to suppress or hide the skin condition is really not a long term approach in the right direction. These products available in the market are time being fix with many of them causing side effects.\n\nThe very basic and known technique of managing stress is to Breathe deep. It is ancient wisdom and very helpful if practiced with the right dedication. Breathe deep technique helps provides better oxygen to the blood, improves blood circulation, relaxes and regulates the body functioning.  However in this fast-paced life, there needs a quick feel factor, a push or zeal to practice the technique every day for it to become a routine inculcating overall wellbeing. Therefore, essential oils aromatherapies have long been used in different cultures in different civilizations to heal and relax the body &amp; the mind.\n\nUp until the early 19th century, essential oils were one of the strongest medicine available before the beginning of pharmacology/ allopath medicine.\n\nInhalation/deep breathing is one of the quick instant ways to bring in the change for the better transformation of thoughts &amp; feelings. Inhalation of the right therapeutic essential oil deeply makes a positive change on mind and emotion helping overcome depression, anger, anxiety, loss of memory, and lack of creativity.  The loss of connect with nature over the decades has increased the stress-related concerns majorly.\n\nEssential oils, especially steam-distilled are plant-derived and a drop act as nature on the finger tip. As per Ayurveda, the essential oils are pure prana of the plant, a gift to us to calm and support our body functioning. The essential oils are often used by yoga-practicing individuals to bring in a deep sense of calm &amp; peace and establish an inner connect with the body, mind &amp; soul.\n\nThe different essential oils like lavender, lemongrass, orange, sweet lime, peppermint, vetiver, basil, camphor, chamomile, etc can be used in different aromatherapy techniques to bring in a positive mindset as a healthy mind is vital for healthy skin. If the mind is not healthy- free from stress, no product in the world can work for the skin no matter how expensive it is.\n\nThe essential oils can be used in diffusers, applied to the wrist/beneath the nose or on a fingertip, and inhaled. Apply on the pillowcase and find convenient ways that suit you to make use of it in day-to-day life to stay calm free from stress and beautiful.\n\n[Return to natural beautiful you ](https://www.snaana.com/) by  taking control of your mind body &amp; soul, overcoming the lifestyle disorders, and experience the power of holistic health – inner health = outer health.\n\n**Inhale beauty and exhale stress.**'<br />Author: 'snaana_'  id: 'k1awws'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k1awws/healthy_body_healthy_skin/</li>

Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one's mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramātmā.
