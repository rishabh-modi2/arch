      <li>Title::: 'When Calcutta Sent Aid To Ireland'<br />Body: 'Today is St.Patrick\'s Day, celebrated in honour of St.Patrick, one of the Patron Saints of Ireland.\n\nI thought I\'d write a little bit about a time when Ireland wasn\'t doing so well and how we helped them a little bit through the Irish Famine.\n\nYou can read more about the Famine in your own time, but essentially, Ireland\'s main crop, the potato, failed massively in the 1840\'s. Because of this, and especially because of the United Kingdom\'s failure to provide relief to the people during the time, about a million people died, and more than a million left the nation for newly developing countries like Australia and the USA.\n\nThe Prime Minister of the UK at the time, John Russel, appointed a man named Charles Trevelyan in charge of the Government Relief Programme to Ireland, to help see them through the Famine.\n\nCharles Trevelyan\'s attitude towards relief during the Irish Famine were pretty similar to Churchill\'s attitude towards the Bengal Famine. He pretty much didn\'t care, and went so far as to say that "the judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson", like he was some sort of megalomaniac. Needless to say, the Irish don\'t remember him very fondly.\n\nWith Government aid from the Crown lacking, other nations and cities turned to help the Irish through their troubling times.\n\nIn particular, Calcutta was the very first place to do so.\n\nThe Brits living in Calcutta organised the fundraiser. They intended to show to the Irish the benefits of living in the British Empire (kind of ironic, since the Crown itself pretty much refused to aid the Irish).\n\nThe fundraising committee was headed by an English judge (Sir Lawrence Peel) and civil servant (Sir James Grant) and included a number of Irish men and native Indians. The committee appealed to other Europeans residing in India and to the ‘native community’, the ethnic Indian populace to become involved in its philanthropic activities.\n\nAt the time, about 40% of the British Army Soldiers serving in India (I suspect this is separate from the Indian Sipahis/Sepoys) were Irish, and they gave generously to feed those back home.\n\nThe Indian population also gave generously, donations from the Princes and the wealthy, as well as donations from the less well off sipahis/sepoys, and also the low-paid Indian workers were made.\n\nThe total funds collected at Calcutta came close to £14,000 pounds (at that time). In modern currency, that\'s close to 14 Crore Indian Rupees.\n\nIronically, Queen Victoria herself donated only £2000 pounds, or close to two crores in modern Indian Rupees.\n\nThe Irish and Indians share a history of fighting back against the Imperial Brits. It\'s a bit ironic IMO, that about a Hundred years after the Irish dealt with their famine and Crowns apathy towards them, the Indians of Bengal would face their own.\n\nAs the Irish say: May the hinges of our friendship never grow rusty!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n[The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845–1849, by Cecil Woodham-Smith.](http://groupelavigne.free.fr/woodham-smith1962.pdf)\n\n[IrishAmerica - International Relief Efforts During the Famine](https://irishamerica.com/2009/08/international-relief-efforts-during-the-famine/#:~:text=Calcutta%2C%20India%20was%20the%20first,part%20of%20the%20British%20Empire).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd some Irish Cooking, because why not?\n\n[Irish Stew - Tasting History by Max Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KpFs1CHgw&amp;ab_channel=TastingHistorywithMaxMiller)\n\nThis video was the one that prompted me to write up this piece. \n\nAlso, Max Miller\'s Channel is great! \n\nDespite being a Vegetarian I watch his videos for the history.

      <li>Title::: 'Are Indian Tribals Hindus?'<br />Body: '"According to the Constitution of India, laws framed for Hindus apply to the following three categories of people:\n(a) to any person who is a Hindu by religion in any of its forms and developments, including a Virashaiva, a Lingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj,\n(b) to any person who is a Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion, and\n(c) to any other person domiciled in the territories to which this Act extends who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion.\n\nThus, according to the constitution, every citizen of India, except a Muslim, a Christian, a Parsi or a Jew, is legally a Hindu. The constitution draws a distinction between three categories of legal Hindus:\n\n(a) Hindus Category One (consisting of all those who can still be categorised as full-fledged Hindus within the Hindu religious fold, including members of sects having antecedents traceable to mainline Hindu religious texts or individuals),\n\n(b) Hindus Category Two (consisting of members of the three sects, namely Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, founded by Hindu individuals, which originated as sects within the Hindu religious fold, but, in the course of history, came to acquire a more distinctive  religious identity), and\n\n(c)  Hindus Category Three (consisting of members of indigenous religious groups native to India, not founded by any particular individual, following ancestral forms of belief or worship not specifically having antecedents traceable to mainline Hindu religious texts or sects).\n[Hinduism is a Parliament of all the three categories]\n\nThe people who are outside this purview themselves belong to two categories:\n\n(a) ex-Hindus, i.e. Muslims and Christians, who, by and large, are converts from the Hindu fold, and\n\n(b) non-Hindus, i.e. Jews and Parsis, who, in spite of different degrees of intermingling with local people, are by and large historical descendants of non-Hindu refugees or migrants from outside India"].\n\n\'If the depressed classes join Islam or Christianity, they not only go out of the Hindu religion, but they also go out of the Hindu culture…What the consequences of conversion will do to the country as a whole is well worth bearing in mind. Conversion to Islam or Christianity will denationalize the depressed classes\' (Dhanajay Keer: \'Dr Ambedkar: Life and Mission\', p.279). \n\nPeople say Indian Tribals being categorised as Hindus was a lazy work of the British.

      <li>Title::: 'Does anybody else find Trinetra Gumaraju nauseatingly annoying?'<br />Body: 'For those of you who don\'t know, Trinetra Haldar Gumaraju is an Instagram trans activist/doctor (MBBS). The summary of her Instagram account is - Ugly faces with accompanying preachy sermons on caste/gender(cis het bad😡)/privilege, basically issues she thinks she\'s an expert on. Check her Insta handle @ind0ctrination\n\nNow I totally sympathise with the fact that trans people have a hard time coming out and being at peace with themselves and just being left the hell alone without all the bullying/tormenting/teasing. But this lady just takes it to a whole new level. First of all I find it ironic that she chides literally every cis het male for their "cis het male privilege" and how cis het males are far more privileged than her while she has the economic wherewithal to get a gender reassignment surgery+ hormonal therapy costing 13 lakhs AND an education in medicine from a private university while thousands of cis het males struggle to get even a decent undergraduate education, let alone fill the craters associated with their identity. \n\nSecond of all she uses her trans identity to shit on the govt(CAA/Farmer\'s protests) which literally has nothing to do with her trans identity lol. I mean with respect to letting LGBTQ marriages prevail she has a bone to pick, but apart from that I see little relevance \n\nThird - Inherent assumption that all cis het people are monsters and filthy SOBs. Look I get you might have been treated badly by cis het people but that gives you no right to demonize all of us. But then again this is the #AllMen mentality which strangely never translates to #AllMuslims. Now when someone pointed out the irony in her post that hating someone based on their sexual orientation is precisely the thing you\'re fighting against so isn\'t it hypocritical of you to engage in the same, she says "A minority is allowed to hate on the majority but not the other way around"(WTF?!)\n\nFourth - If you don\'t date trans women, you\'re transphobic. \n\nNo I\'m not. It\'s my life, and I am have all the right to choose who i wish to be romantically involved with. You may be great as a friend and I wouldn\'t mind going out and getting drinks with you, but I just can\'t get into a physical relationship with someone who is biologically male. Maybe it\'s my prejudice but when it comes to love, everyone is motivated by prejudice. Think of someone you love and try coming up with a logic based proof. You can\'t because it doesn\'t work like that. \n\n\nThese are just a few I can think of, but I\'d love to here your opinions!'<br />Author: 'Gunpowder_gelatin765'  id: 'm6stqm'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m6stqm/does_anybody_else_find_trinetra_gumaraju/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Destruction of caste in the 21st century.'<br />Body: "A frequent criticism of Hinduism is the conflation of the religion with Brahminism and the enforcement of caste as a power hegemonic structure. We've all read the literature by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on how it is impossible to conceive a Hinduism devoid of caste, but we've also seen various initiatives by the Brahmo Samaj and the Arya Samaj to counter the same, not to mention the generations of progressive religious leaders from Basava to Narayana Guru. Caste still persists in practice, even though virtually all Hindu schools of thought, despite their difference in ideology and acceptance of the scriptures, are aware of how it is an irrational construct (or manipulated, if that's your opinion, but the nature of the construct isn't the question) and it still dictates a certain amount of power transaction in the 21st century. This problem isn't one that concerns solely people of the Hindu denomination either. It has turned into a sociopolitical entity, digging deep into the structures of other religions in India as well. \n\nThis is a complicated topic with a lot of turbulent history, but I would like this post to at least act as a primer to your thoughts about it anyway. What are your ideas on approaches to destroying caste, and is the idea of Hinduism (or other religions for that matter, although Hinduism is probably the only one directly influenced on a practice basis) without the caste construct simply a fantasy?"<br />Author: 'Low-Indication-259'  id: 'm6asbu'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m6asbu/destruction_of_caste_in_the_21st_century/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Is India's border with Myanmar a source of political instability?"<br />Body: "Looking at the current implosion in Myanmar from a historical perspective, that is a question worth pondering because all the while, India has been fixated on the borders towards its West or with China. \n\nGeographically, the region from the Northeast all the way Vietnam is a contiguous area with dense and hilly monsoon forest. It is no surprise that the people who inhabit this area have very strong tribal loyalty, because historically, they hardly wandered outside of their tribe. The environment gave them all the basic necessities so there's no need for trade and peaceful interaction with other tribes. \n\nBuilding a nation state in this region seems difficult. India had its fair share of difficulties in the Northeast in the past, but in Myanmar, the problem is a lot bigger. To this day, the military is fighting rebel groups representing various tribes deep in the forest. Perhaps a politically unstable country is what created a heavy-handed military to keep it all together, resulting to all the news we're hearing in Myanmar today. \n\nHowever my opinion to the question is, **not really.** Yes its hard to form a common identity in this region but no because the instability is usually confined to inside the region. Taking India's example, Northeast and Myanmar were never the same as Kashmir and Pakistan where the latter actively tried to politically destabilize New Delhi. \n\nWhat's your opinion on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'm69y0j'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m69y0j/is_indias_border_with_myanmar_a_source_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Education'<br />Body: 'I want to preface this by saying that, yes, **I am a 15 year old "kid" from and living in Maharashtra**. This post may or may not be of relevance to you. I apologize for any inconveniences.\n\nI have had a few questions for quite a long time now. My school (10th grade) follows the **SSC** board pattern of Maharashtra. This post follows the same pattern and is most probably not same for the other boards. There is a different upcoming class pattern which may or may not be similar to what I have stated in this post.\n\n Why does it go like this:\n\ni. Government sets a specific syllabus for "kids" aged 15-16 years.\n\nii.  Exam is held on that specific syllabus. \n\niii. That exam decides what college the "kid" gets into.\n\niv. The kid can\'t get into Science because only people with 90%+ in the "specific syllabus exam" are eligible and "worthy". The kid has to go to a bad Science college or just go for Commerce or Arts.\n\nv. The kid, already pummeled by the insults from his/her parents and/or relatives and friends, can\'t perform well because they either got a bad college or had to take a different study field. Follow with another barrage of insults.\n\nvi. The kid can\'t easily get a decent job because not many hire someone who didn\'t get above 90% in the aforementioned exam and/or in the respective college field.\n\nvii. The kid\'s life is either totally ruined or, at the very least, made inconvenient (inadvertently?) due to the "specific syllabus exam". I know this is an exaggeration but we can\'t deny the existence of unemployment.\n\nI\'m not saying the syllabus is wrong. It\'s straight up shit. The blatant emphasis on mugging up is in every freaking subject. Science, Math, Geography, History, freaking languages Sanskrit-English-Marathi; you name it. Mug up the answers including **self response** in Science-Social Studies-Marathi, mug up **whole theorems and proofs** in Math, mug up the critical appreciation (a type of writing skill) for the poem in English-Marathi, mug up a total of **\\~50 pages** including nouns-pronouns-verbs-essays?! for Sanskrit (p.s. you\'re learning a language). Don\'t worry you got those digests/masterkeys (study books which are essentially QNA for mugging). Then everyone wonders why "kids" don\'t have any interest in studying. 2 reasons; some are totally lax, lazy due to such study methods and some like me are just frustrated.\n\nOf course it\'s not all bad but the bad ones are extremely frustrating. There is not a hint of sex education nor proper human body anatomy in \'primary education\'. And, yeah, only the anatomy part makes it\'s way in \'secondary education\' as if it\'s unnecessary education. Oh, I forgot about the Geography of Brazil being taught to us while there hasn\'t been a single History book regarding our freedom fighters nor any of the world wars. it\'s just been "Stone Age Man" and "Shivaji Maharaj" with the first chapter every year being "SOURCES OF HISTORY". Nothing regarding financial independence and the only book that seemed legit (Self Development and Art Appreciation) was just copying off the entire textbook into a notebook every Friday. The Government though won\'t have a damn problem with basing what college you get into on the marks you get in that exam. \n\nThe solution is simple or difficult depending on what you choose from these. \n\n1. **Give the students the freedom to choose what they want to study. (difficult)**\n\nThis will require a lot of restructuring and is certainly what many wouldn\'t even want to do. I am fully aware that my opinion is not that popular. 15/16 year olds aren\'t kids who need guidance unless you let them grow like that. We know what we want. Get the emphasis on Money, Grades, Percentages, Degrees out of here, parents and teachers. Sometimes I have to wonder if we were given birth just to get certain percentages/grades in certain exams or to earn the maximum amount of money. It seems like straight up brainwashing your children.\n\n2. **Just don\'t let 10th grade marks count. (easy)**\n\nWhy do you need an exam that will supposedly decide what college will accept a kid while consequently tampering with the kid\'s future? We\'re going to be paying the college fees aren\'t we? Do not let the 10th board marks be counted for anything regarding education for example, colleges, jobs? and a person\'s freaking dignity.\n\nI always had a knack for learning English and anything related to technology. Thought I would get a degree related to one of those. Parents did a 360 of course saying Arts "has no scope" etc. Turns out there\'s a bazillion degrees available. I thought, "okay, that\'s great so how do I differentiate between those that I like and those that I don\'t?" You can\'t because there is no guide/entity on that topic; you just select one and go (for the money and "scope"). Cue more mugging up in HSC.\n\nI\'ll reiterate that this may not be relevant to you. We need real education. Parents need a reality check and teachers, schools, classes need a run for their money to provide actual real education to everyone.

I have couple of queries:\n\n&gt; Is this 3 intern thing binding on all colleges since last I checked, IITs still had that 1 summer intern only.\n\n&gt; Do you folks thing this 3 intern thing makes for good policy? Personally, I think it to be another bureaucratic loophole that students would need to cross. It's an open secret that apart from CS(and ECE), other branches barely matter and students make do with them because of limited opportunities. Making them do MORE interns in subjects they hate is counter intuitive. Especially considering that the job market is shit, more interns don't make for good policy. In most likelihood, this will lead to more low quality interns to be completed(and unpaid ones too) and hardly the productivity booster that government thinks it is.

      <li>Title::: 'Does Indian right wing liberal exist?'<br />Body: "Are majority of right wing supporters in India conservative or it's just a perception. Like, I consider myself a liberal who supports feminism and LGBTQ rights and same sex marriage. But I don't see myself being a part of left wing.\n\nDoes Indian left wing even a thing. Because a majority of them are straight up hinduphobic and tend to do minority appeasement instead of actual secularism. Most of them are just hypocrites who will do the same things which they oppose if it means opposing the ruling party.\n\nSo getting back to the right wing, is the right wing on the same path as left wing. Like many of them don't support same sex marriage and other stuffs,(If I'm not wrong, BJP said that it is not recognisable), when time is changing and we can be more liberal about it. But I feel like the majority of them see themselves as liberal as the generations change. So can't we become a better version by becoming more liberal and actually promoting that, instead of holding back to the previous notions.\n\nAlso, are these options more polarised after BJP's win as it created a proper right wing which was not there before. Hence forcing people to choose a side.\n\nPS: I don't have much idea about politics, so sorry if some info is wrong and If my thoughts are all over the place.\nAlso, all of them are just queries, so fell free to correct me if I'm wrong."<br />Author: 'MacTavish_28'  id: 'm540jb'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m540jb/does_indian_right_wing_liberal_exist/</li>

Also do check out the last para about India and it\'s bureaucracy.**\n\n**Estimated reading time:** 10 minutes, 28 seconds.

Like most nationalists from British colonies, I had read his books written during his long years in British jails, especially his letters to his daughter. They were elegantly written, and his views and sentiments struck a resonant chord in me. Together with other democratic socialists of the 1950s, I had wondered whether India or China would become the model for development. \\[Sanjeev: Note how LKY started as a socialist\\]\n\nI wanted democratic India, not communist China, to win. But despite achievements such as the green revolution, population growth has kept down India’s standard of living and quality of life.\n\nI visited Delhi for the first time as prime minister in April 1962. I was driven to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru’s home to meet him. It had been the residence of one of the British military commanders-two storeys, wide verandas, spacious grounds beautifully laid out. We had a half-hour discussion.For lunch, we were seated at a long table, probably inherited from British times. Each guest had a large silver tray as his dinner plate, and picked what he fancied from a wide array of rice, chapatis, curries, vegetables, meats, fish, pickles, and condiments that were brought to him. What was unusual was that everyone ate with their fingers. Choo and I had had no practice at this. While they held their food neatly and daintily with their fingertips, we rummaged through ours, the gravy reaching up to our knuckles. We felt and looked messy. I was relieved when silver finger bowls of water with slices of lime came for guests to wash their greasy fingers before eating the sweets, which were delicious. Nehru, sitting opposite me, noticed our awkwardness. I explained that besides chopsticks we usually used forks and spoons. Fortunately, they provided us with cutlery at other meals in Delhi.\n\nI visited Nehru again in 1964 when I stopped in Delhi on my way back from a tour of Africa. He was a shadow of his former self, weary, weak in voice and posture, slumped on a sofa. His concentration was poor. The Chinese attack across the Himalayas had been a blow to his hopes of Afro-Asian solidarity. I left the meeting filled with sadness. He died a few months later, in May.\n\n# LKY AND INDIRA GANDHI\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vigdqyhv1n61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca6ca2519fd0b3e50fad5c41d5b9cd3859d3540\n\nMy meetings with Nehru in the 1960s allowed me to meet his daughter, Indira Gandhi. When we became independent, we asked the Indian government to help Singapore gain acceptance into Afro-Asian organizations; their diplomatic missions gave us unstinting assistance.\n\nA year later, I visited India to thank Gandhi and to interest her government in Southeast Asia. A young, energetic, and optimistic Indira Gandhi met me at the airport with a guard of honor, and drove with me to the former Vice-regal Lodge, now called Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nIt was sad to see the gradual rundown of the country, visible even in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The crockery and cutlery were dreadful-at dinner one knife literally snapped in my hand and nearly bounced into my face. Air conditioners, which India had been manufacturing for many years, rumbled noisily and ineffectively. The servants, liveried in dingy white and red uniforms, removed hospitality liquor from the side tables in our rooms. Delhi was “dry” most days of the week. On one occasion, returning to the Rashtrapati Bhavan after a reception given by our high commissioner, my two Indian ADCs in resplendent uniforms entered the elevator with me with their hands behind their backs. As I got out, I noticed they were holding some bottles. I asked my secretary who explained that they were bottles of Scotch. It was the practice at our high commission’s diplomatic receptions to give bottles of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky to deserving guests, and each ADC received two. They were not obtainable in India because they could not be imported. There was a hypocritical pretense at public egalitarianism, with political leaders wearing homespun clothes to identify themselves with their poor, while they quietly amassed wealth. This undermined the morale of the elite officers, civil and military.\n\nMy few days’ stay in the Rashtrapati Bhavan and my meetings with their top leaders at receptions and in various settings were a sobering experience. On my earlier visits in 1959 and 1962, when Nehru was in charge, I thought India showed promise of becoming a thriving society and a great power. By the late 1970s, I thought it would become a big military power because of its size but not an economically thriving one because of its stifling bureaucracy.Indian officials were more interested in getting into the joint communique, a commitment from Singapore to join it in its “great concern over the danger to the world in general and Southeast Asia in particular arising from prolongation of the conflict in Vietnam.” Its nonalignment policy was tilted toward the Soviet Union; this was the price to ensure a regular supply of weapons and military technology.\n\n# LKY AND NARASIMHA RAO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygjws49bv1n61.png?width=285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e2f21a2a008c8557578991434f54b4d7e5cf48\n\nIn 1992, Narasimha Rao’s minority Congress government was forced to change India’s economic policies radically to comply with an IMF rescue package. Rao got on well with my prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, when they met at the Non-Aligned conference in Jakarta in 1992, and persuaded him to visit India with a delegation of Singapore businesspeople. His finance minister, Manmohan Singh, and his commerce minister, P. Chidambaram, visited Singapore to brief me on their changes in policy and attract investments from Singaporeans. Both ministers were clear on how to improve India’s economic growth and knew what had to be done. The problem was how to get it done with an opposition that was xenophobic on free enterprise, free markets, foreign trade, and investments.\n\nRao visited Singapore in September 1994 and discussed India’s opening up with me. The most difficult obstacle, I said, was the mindset of Indian civil servants toward foreigners-that they were out to exploit India and should be hindered. If he wanted foreign investments to flow into India freely, as in China, they must change their mindsets and accept that it was their duty to facilitate, not regulate, the activities of investors. He invited me to visit India for a brainstorming session with his colleagues and his top civil servants.In January 1996, I visited Delhi and spoke to his civil servants at the India International Centre, and also to businesspeople from their three chambers of commerce, on the obstacles that blocked India’s path to higher economic growth. In a separate one-on-one meeting with Rao, he acknowledged that age-old fears of Indians that economic reforms would lead to unequal distribution of wealth had made it difficult for him to proceed with further changes. He had injected large amounts of money to benefit the people but had been accused by his opposition of selling and mortgaging the country. He highlighted two social issues: India’s slow rate of public housing because funds were lacking and its high birth rate. He wanted my prime minister to help him in his housing program. I had to dampen his high expectations that because of our successful housing program we could solve India’s housing problems. Singapore could provide India with planning but they had to raise the resources to implement the plans themselves.\n\nWhen I met Rao in the 1980s, he was foreign minister in Indira Gandhi’s government. He was of the generation of independence fighters, in his late seventies and on the verge of retirement. When Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 in the middle of an election campaign, the Congress Party agreed on Rao as leader. A sympathy vote gave his party the largest number of seats, although short of a majority. Rao became prime minister and for the first two of five years carried out radical economic reforms; but he was not an energetic young man chasing his own ideas. The impetus to the Indian economy came from Manmohan Singh, his finance minister, who ironically had started his career as a central planner. Rao did not have the conviction to persuade the people of India to support these reforms over the heads of an obstructive opposition.With slow economic but high population growth, India is not about to be a wealthy nation for some time. It has to solve its economic and social problems before it can play a major role in Southeast Asia. It is in Asean’s interest to have India grow stronger and help maintain peace and stability on the Indian Ocean side of Southeast Asia.\n\n# LKY AND INDIA’S BUREAUCRACY\n\nIndia has so many outstanding people in all fields of scholarship, but for a number of reasons it has allowed the high standards the British left them to be lowered. There is less insistence now on meritocracy by examinations for entrance into top schools and universities, the professions, and the Indian Civil Service (ICS). Cheating at examinations is rampant. Universities allot their quota of places to MPs of their state, who either give or sell these places to their constituents.\n\nThe ICS in British days was selected from the creme de la creme of all India. An Indian had to be outstanding to be admitted into this elite British service. During one of my visits in the 1960s, I stayed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Before golf one morning, two Indian officers who had been members of the original ICS, not the IAS (Indian Administrative Service) which it had since become, came for breakfast. They were impressive. One of them explained how a few hundred ICS officers governed 450 million Indians in British India and governed well. He spoke with nostalgia of the quality of the men selected for the ICS, and regretted that the entrance examinations, which used to be conducted only in English, could now be taken in English or in Hindi. Populist pressures had lowered standards of recruitment and had also led to poorer communications within the service.It was a gradual slide in quality of a once elite service, now caught up in the throes of a social and economic revolution which had reduced living standards. During the days of the British Raj, they had lived up to a certain lifestyle. Generals, admirals, air marshals, and senior ICS officials played golf. In the India of the 1960s and 1970s, they could not buy good (i.e., imported) golf balls because their import was forbidden. I remember one excursion to the Delhi Golf Club. Our high commission had advised me to bring several boxes of golf balls to distribute to the committee members of the club. It was depressing to see top brass and civil servants breaking up the packages and taking fistfuls of golf balls to stuff into their golf bags.Indeed, golf balls were so precious that caddies would dash into any house or rough to find them. Once, at the former Bombay Royal Golf Course in 1965, I sliced my ball into a squatter area and heard the loud clatter as it fell on a zinc roof. My caddie dashed off, I thought to find out who was hurt. But a little boy emerged with the golf ball, not to complain of injury but to bargain over the price of the ball. I was sad to see how the caddies had collected broken plastic and wooden tees, sharpened their ends and reused them to tee up the balls of the players. In the locker rooms, bearers (menservants) put on and took off your socks and shoes. There were too many hands with too little work.Perhaps the fault lies in the system.\n\nIndia has wasted decades in state planning and controls that have bogged it down in bureaucracy and corruption. A decentralized system would have allowed more centers like Bangalore and Bombay to grow and prosper. Another reason could be their caste system. It has been the enemy of meritocracy–each caste demands its quota in all institutions, whether recruitment into the IAS or entrance to the universities. A third reason is the endless conflicts and wars with Pakistan that make both poorer.The Delhi I visited in the 1960s was a big, sprawling city with many open spaces, not polluted and without too many squatters. The Delhi of the 1990s was an environmental mess. It was January and the air smelled foul with the fumes from coal burning in power stations and in homes. There were squatters everywhere. For security, they placed a whole company of soldiers in front of the Sheraton Hotel where I stayed. And traffic was clogged up. It was not the spacious city as it once was.\n\n"India is a nation of unfulfilled greatness.

Now, I am all for not letting people trample my point of views based on misinformation, but I'm concerned about where this leaves the independent directors and producers of India\n\nA lot of the reason why Bollywood hasn't reached the same level of proficiency is Hollywood is the lack of experimentation by the big directors. Every movie in the 80s followed the same basic script, and then every movie from the 90s followed another common basic script. There were some great movies too, but they were done by directors no one had heard of, and nobody was gonna go and watch a movie by some unknown director, right? When Hollywood was making masterpieces like *Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, and Good Will Hunting*, Bollywood was making *Maine Pyaar Kiya*.\n\nThe recent 8-9 years are the ones in which BIG directors in India have started experimentation with their films, making them more *lifelike,* not just another fairytale-esque story. But now with heavy censorship laws I'm concerned that new directors will be too scared to put out an original social commentary without it being taken down. \n\nFor example, Bombay Begums is one of the first known *mainstream* films that really looks into teenage  drug abuse, and provides an insight into the mind of a teen who has been exposed to the rotten parts of the world. But the people are too scared to face reality and want it to be taken down because of this. They would rather turn a blind eye than learn from the truth. It's true that this movie has other parts which arguably make it worthy of being taken down (read: the Geeta scene), but this one is not it. \n\nWhat do you think?"<br />Author: 'throwwthatt'  id: 'm4o0as'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m4o0as/where_do_you_think_the_ott_scene_of_india_is/</li>

I recently had the opportunity to watch a travel documentary called "Caribbean with Simon Reeve", and I had assumed how this would be just another "destination travel" documentary with pretty beaches. However, this show instead shows a "behind the scenes" facade of the nations.\n\nOne striking example shown is the country of Haiti. I had assumed the country to be just another poor south american country with no actual significance. But when I saw the documentary I realized that Haiti was among the first ever "fully black" nations to achieve independence in 1805. \n\nThe country was "discovered" and colonized by Christopher Columbus who landed in Haiti (which is described to us as discovered "America"). It started off by killing the native south american population and then flooding it with African Slaves. The French were the major colonizers, which the slaves overthrew in 1805. So much for the "French revolution" which is shown as a shining example to people all over the world. Haitians even defeated Napoleons army successfully.\n\nIt also describes about how the French converted the "savage" Africans to "civilized" Christianity. Haitian\'s religion is still Christianity but the culture is "Vodoo". Obviously, the word "Vodoo" itself is thought of something like black magic, quite similar to the parallels with Hinduism. Anything that the Europeans considered "foreign" (or could not understand\n) were termed "bad". Moreover, the Haitians were among the riches colonies, and the French blockaded them and forced them to pay an indemnity because the Haitians "prevented them from colonizing". See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti_indemnity_controversy\n\nConsequently, after around 130 years of payment, it turned into a poor helpless country that we know (or not know) now. We being Indians are not exactly freely made to know the extent of colonial oppression that we were made to undergo. These colonial countries are now supremely rich while they also now want to dictate how our countries must be governed. I\'d recommend you all to watch it.\n\nAnother of his series is "Greece with Simon Reeve". You might think that Greece is another developed European nation, but that is not exactly the case. Greece has more in common with Africa/Asia/Mediterranean and barely managed to get included in EU (because it was one of the "ancient" civilizations). In the episode, there is quite a large part of it dedicated to the Island of Crete. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete\n\nInterviews with local showcase how proud of their culture they are. They train their kids the use of guns because of the atrocities done to them by Germany during World War 2. One of the interviewees declares a matter-of-factly - "If someone insults my country or religion, they\'re not leaving this place alive". I\'m not sure why a country like India which has endured far worse things than a country like Greece is willing to acknowledge the rich culture and heritage we have? All over the country I see people simping for the Western culture, which is not necessarily bad, but you need not put down Indian culture for it!\n\nSimon then takes us to mainland Greece which has many similar problems like India - waste management with literal mountains of waste, etc. And he identifies the country is the way it is beacuse a lot of money and freebies. I noticed an interesting parallel with India - socialist politicians like Arvind Kejriwal (and almost all other parties to some extent) don\'t think twice about doling out free money to people in some or the other way. This, in the end will harm the public with loss of jobs and other infrastructure things. \n\nThis post is more of a rant/FYI, and I just thought of sharing it here.

      <li>Title::: 'Wodeyars of Mysore: Rajput Alliances'<br />Body: 'In my last post here https://np.reddit.com/comments/m2m89v, I explained how the Wodeyars invented a foreign chandravamshi lineage, created the Urs caste and dismantled the supra-local ruling classes of the Vokkaligas, but failed to penetrate the local power structures that were still in the hands of Vokkaligas and Lingayats. While the Urs sanskritised and anglicised themselves they were still regarded as an inferior caste by these landed communities. This post shall be about how they forged matrimonial alliances with the Rajputs, to buttress their Kshatriya status. \n\nWhen Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodeyar participated in the Imperial Assemblage held at Delhi in 1877 at the age of fourteen, he was treated with every mark of consideration as one belonging to the first rank of princes along with the Nizam of Hyderabad. But behind all the pomp and glory, he may have realised that among the Indian princes, Mysore was not regarded as highly as other Kshatriyas, and felt the isolation. He wished to enter the imperial space that the Kshatriyas in the North had already established through marriage alliances with each other.\n\nAfter the unfortunate loss of Chamarajendra Wodeyar to diphtheria , the Maharani, who then became the Regent on behalf of her young son, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV, asked the British for assistance to fulfil her late husband’s wishes. \n\nBut the letters from the British agents in the north were all disappointing. They all said that the Rajput chiefs did not recognise the Mysore family as belonging to their caste and that there would be difficulties in effecting a matrimonial alliance with Mysore, unless possibly a beginning could be made by marrying a Mysore princess to a Rajput chief. The Maharao of Kotah, who had recently lost his Udaipur wife, wanted to marry a Mysore princess with Rs. five lakhs of dowry, which was a huge amount of money considering that the civil list of Mysore Maharaja was then fourteen lakhs. Meanwhile, the Urs clan strongly opposed against the idea of giving Mysore princesses away. The Maharani refused, feeling uneasy about sending her young daughter away among ‘people of strange language and habits’. By failing to give Mysore princesses to the Rajput chiefs, Mysore made it even more difficult for them to find a bride for the young Maharaja.\n\nNonetheless efforts continued and in 1898 a Mysore deputation was sent to north India, and Diwan Sheshadri Iyer in his Memo of Instruction stressed on “history” stating that the Wodeyars “emigrated from Dwaraka many generations ago” and belonged to the same stock as the Rajput ruling houses. The mythological origin stories of Yaduraya Wodeyar were printed in Kannada as Annals of the Mysore Royal Family and used as history text book in schools. With that, myth became fact.\n\nThey also made clear several promises on the side of Mysore. Any money or property which the bride’s father might wish to give her would be her own, the Mysore royal house would not take any dowry [this was not strange in the local context as dowry in the South is considered to be a new phenomenon. Traditionally, wedding expenses and the exchanging of gifts was shared much less asymmetrically between the bride’s kin and the groom’s kin, since South Indian kinship system was more isogamous compared (Srinivas 1984: 10)]. It was also asserted that Krishnaraja would remain monogamous while the bride was alive. \n\nThe tradition of endogamous marriage between the Wodeyars and the Urs was broken for the first time by the marriage of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV with a princess from Vana, Kathiawar in 1900.  But this was not without compromise as there was a huge gap in the political status in the imperial order between them. Vana was just 62 square kms large, with population of just 2,749 and an annual revenue of a paltry Rs. 38,900. Their ruler was not even granted a gun salute by the British while Mysore was one of the three states at the time to be accorded the 21 gun salute, the highest of honours. The royal wedding itself cost Rs. 20 lakh. Krishnaraja Wodeyar was worth USD 56 Billion in today’s prices. \n\nWith this marriage the ice was broken and marriages with north Indian princely states has continued ever since. The last king of the dynasty, Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, the nephew of Krishnaraja Wodeyar – also married a princess from north India. She was from Charkhari, a princely state in Uttar Pradesh, which had the privilege of a 11 gun salute.\n\nAn interesting fact is that the Mysore royal family, did not have any ‘rajput blood’ till 2017 as none of the foreign marriages had produced any offspring. This was attributed to a curse believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the Vijaynagar Empire. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death :\n\n&gt; "Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali" ( May Talakadu become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children).\n\nThis curse was however broken by the birth of a baby boy to Yaduveer Wodeyar (the adopted son of Rani Pramoda Devi) and the princess of Dungarpur in 2017.\n\nReferences: Ikegame, Aya.

Indeed, if the growth rates trends seen from the latest census data sustain, Muslims may actually account for a lower proportion of India’s population than at their peak in 2011.\n\nThe 2011 census puts the Muslim population at 17.22 crore or 14.22% of India’s total population.

Assume that the growth rate pattern from 2001-2011, which has been used to suggest that Hindus are somehow falling behind, will persist. Population growth is calculated using an exponential growth rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Hindu growth rate is 1.55% annually, while Muslims’ is 2.2%. The figures for the previous decade (1991-2001) are an annual 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. If this decline in growth rates persists (both continue to grow at slower rates), both Hindu and Muslim populations will hit a peak in 2061.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Then, Muslims will number 29.24 crore and Hindus 140.25 crore.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Hindu population will stabilize in 2071 at 139.43 crore. But Muslims will only account for 91.68 crore of the population or 39.21%.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will be by **2091** that Muslims will outnumber Hindus in India if the growth rate increases by 17 basis points every decade. *But for that pattern to persist, Muslim population will have to grow to 182.91 crore and the Muslim exponential growth rate at that point comes to be over 3.54%.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# “That will never happen. The highest exponential growth rates for population do not generally exceed 2%. All communities see a reduction in population growth as the level of education and development increase," said S.K. Singh, professor at the Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics at the International Institute for Population Studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*To put it in context, global population growth rate peaked out at 2.19% in 1962-63, according to Geoffrey Gilbert’s World Population: A Reference Handbook. Moreover, India’s population would be 311.41 crore by 2091 in the third scenario.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe United Nations has projected India’s population to grow to 170.53 crore by 2050, and then decline to 165.97 by 2100. While that is not gospel truth, it also suggests that neither the scenario of Hindu population growing to 219.95 crore, nor the Muslim population growing to 182.91 crore are likely to come true.\n\nThe UN’s 2050 figure, however, is close to the base-case scenario which estimates a total population of 173.03 crore by 2061. Thus, the scenario where Hindus outnumber Muslims 4:1 seems most likely of the three. The assumption for that scenario is that growth rates from 2011 will decline in the same way that they did between 2001 and 2011. Why? Simply because literacy and economic well-being are improving, although at a debatable pace.\n\n“The pace of convergence depends on a number of socio-economic, political and programme factors, and the process will be hastened with the spread of mass education especially amongst women and girls and a sustained reduction in poverty across all population groups," says the Sachar Committee report released in 2006.'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'm3jw81'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m3jw81/india_wont_become_a_muslim_majority_country/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Let's discuss about Population Control Bill (PCB)"<br />Body: 'https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/centre-gets-moving-population-control-law\n\nDated : 25.1.2020\n\n\n**The Centre has began the ground work to enact a law to check population explosion in the country** subsequent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech last year in which underlined the need to address the grave issue. However, it may take at least two years to be able to push any legislation.\n\nSources, aware of the development, said there is a feeling within the government that any legislation to check population growth must be based on the facts and data of the latest Census, which is going to take place in 2021.\n\nSince the report of the Census would be available only in 2022, the government would not be able to go for any legislation.\n\n“Before formulating any legislation, we must know the actual position. So the coming National Population Register (NPR) is very crucial. There are certain anomalies in the Census process, as a result of which there are discrepancies in the available data. A report published by a Chinese scholar in 2017 put the actual Indian population figure at 142 crore,” a source said. However, as per official figures, the current Indian population is 137 crore, which is second in the world, after China.\n\nNotwithstanding this wait, the government has started the consultation process with different stakeholders. An NGO has been assigned to carry out preliminary surveys on the reproductive rights of the women. The NGO—Taxab—is already on the job. “We intend to survey 1 lakh women, covering each district of the country, who have three or more children. Preliminary findings suggest that most women are against the third child. They go for it under several kinds of pressure,” Manu Gaur, president of Taxab, said.\n\nBesides studying the issue of reproductive rights of the women, the government is also looking at the issue from the angle of child human rights. If a parent is not able to take care of the family properly, then the child, who comes to this earth because of wrong planning, also suffers, which is against his right to life. This way, it is a violation of his human rights.\n\nAnother aspect, which is being looked into is the idea of responsible parenting. A draft Responsible Parenthood Bill was prepared two years ago, which was signed by 125 MPs from different political parties and submitted to then Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan. Subsequently, a senior BJP leader and former Minister Sanjeev Balyan moved a private member’s bill on the issue in the Lower House.\n\nThere have been efforts in the past to enact law to check population explosion. But there was a lack of commitment to address the issue, except during the Indira Gandhi regime, when a two-child policy was implemented by Sanjay Gandhi. However, that drew wide criticism from different quarters for being coercive and forced.\n\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/politics/population-control-bill-is-a-daft-idea-hindus-need-to-shun-lazy-shortcuts-and-come-up-with-practical-solutions\n\n\nDated : 13.8.2020\n\n\n&gt;Nonetheless, any such bill would be a terrible idea.\n\nFirst, we should immediately rule out those who want to genuinely achieve lower population via such a law. Overall, total fertility rate (TFR) among women in India (as per 2011 census) is already close to replacement level of 2.1, meaning that if we don’t do anything, the population will remain constant and not increase. In fact, TFR is expected to fall below the replacement level in 2021 census and continue to fall in coming years with increase in urbanisation and education level. So, there is absolutely no need to address a problem that doesn’t exist.\n\nSecond, the main issue is not of overall TFR but certain TFRs - TFR of Muslim women and TFR in select few poor, rural states (primarily in eastern India) [TFR in 24 states is already below replacement level, i.e., their population will start falling in coming decades]\n\nNow, high TFR in rural areas is a secular problem and can be addressed with more economic growth, education, awareness programmes, targeted schemes, etc.\n\nIt is the high TFR of Muslim community that is the main issue which proponents of ‘population control bill’ are trying to tackle.\n\nSo, unless the ‘population control bill” are introduced which specifically apply only to Muslim community, this idea must be dropped.\n\nBecause such a law would not only not achieve the objective of curtailing Total Fertility Rate (TFR) among Muslim women but also make things worse in the long run because no one has contemplated the second-order effects of this idea.\n\nThe approaches entailed in all the ‘Population control Bills’ can be summed up in two categories - punishment and reward. First involves giving incentives like preference for admission in education institutions, selection in government jobs, tax breaks, etc and second one involves steps like barring law breakers from contesting elections, receiving government subsidies, etc.\n\nThese approaches tell us that population control bill proponents believe that high TFR among Muslims is a secular problem. There is enough evidence to the contrary. In Kerala, higher literacy has done little to bring down TFR of Muslim community.\n\nIf the Muslim community is religiously motivated to produce more children so that it gains a demographic advantage in few decades, which it is, then tax breaks or cutting down subsidies is not going to have any effect. There are neither that many Muslim taxpayers nor that many poor Muslims who can’t live without PDS ration from the government.\n\nThe only section which will be badly hit will be poor Hindus. Rich Hindus don’t need tax breaks to not have children. They are not having them anyway. In fact, they need tax breaks to have more children, not less. This is where we come to actual solution.\n\nHindutva leaders need to realise that high TFR of Muslims is not the problem, high TFR deficit vis-a-vis Hindus is. Hence, the focus has to be on bridging this gap.\n\nIt means that while Muslim TFR comes down on its own, emphasis should be on increasing the Hindu TFR. It should now become clear how Population control act that applies to everyone equally will hurt Hindus in long run.\n\nBut before we think of increasing TFR for Hindus, we must make one thing clear that we don’t want poor Hindus to procreate more but rich and middle class families to have more children. It’s the latter group which should be encouraged or shamed into having at least two children. There are many reasons why urban Hindus are shying away from starting families or even getting married on time.\n\nTwo chief reasons are economics and unwillingness to take up responsibility/tendency to enjoy life. First can be solved by government programs (with special focus on urban India) which provide quality education and healthcare at highly subsidised rates because these two are big factors budding parents have in mind while planning the family. Second is tougher and needs intervention at family level and requires ground work from Hindu social/religious organisation in changing opinions.\n\nMoreover, as Swarajya’s editorial director R. Jagannathan argues here, Hinduism must become a missionary faith again.\n\nDoing all this won’t as easy as passing a law in parliament but it will be effective. Hindutva side needs to shun lazy shortcuts and shrugging off responsibility by passing laws and thinking its work is done.\n\nFighting to sustain the current demographic balance in india will will require great collective effort. But that’s true for all civilisational battles\n\n\n\n\nSo PCB may not help reduce the TFR of muslim women. You need proper sex education, contraceptives, **UCC to outlaw polygamy**\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your opinions ??'<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'm2t4qf'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m2t4qf/lets_discuss_about_population_control_bill_pcb/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How the Wodeyars of Mysore fabricated a Kshatriya Lineage'<br />Body: 'Kings and rulers often tried to legitimate the superiority of royal houses over the people they ruled by inventing foreign origins and divine lineages. This is called \'Conundrum of the King\'s authority\' because of the inherent contradiction of them being outsiders and at the same time rulers of the local society. \n\nThe caste of the Wodeyars of Mysore is called\xa0 \'Arasu\' / \'Urs\' caste. It means King. According to legend Yaduraya Wodeyar, a young Chandravamshi prince of Dwarka and descendant of Lord Krishna was invited by the Vijaynagar Emperor to rule a small region around the Kaveri River in Karnataka in 1400 CE. When Yaduraya arrives at the village of Hadadana near Mysore, he learns that the local Palegar had renounced his kingship to become an ascetic and that his daughter was being harassed by the army chief Marasa Nayaka . Yaduraya kills the army chief and marries the princess to become the King of Mysore. \n\nThis legend served multiple purposes. It established a chandravamshi kshatriya lineage, it established a connection with the indigenous people through the princess and it could also explain why the descendants of Lord Krishna worshipped the local village goddess \'Chamundeshwari\' as their clan god (Kula Devi). Moreover the villain of the story Marasa Nayaka was a low caste Toreya, this helped further emphasise the pure-blooded superiority of the Wodeyars.\n\nHowever historians noted a lot of inconsistencies. It was extremely far-fetched that the Vijaynagar Emperor Harihara II would invite Yaduraya from Distant Dwarka. Yaduraya would have to risk his life and travel through two hostile Muslim Kingdoms, the Gujarat Sultanate and Brahmani Kingdom to reach Vijaynagar. Epigraphy mentioning the Wodeyars began only 150 years after 1400 CE. The legend of Yaduraya made its advent only in the later half of 17th century. Different versions of the legend had been fabricated by the poets commissioned by\xa0 Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar.\n\nHistorians like David Leeming and Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wodeyars were local feudal lords and that the \'Urs\' had extremely indigenous origins. \n\nIn the 17th century the \'Vokkaligas\'/\'Gowdas\', the landed gentry and agriculturist caste of Karnataka had the most number of ruling families. Chikkadevaraja strategically united the other feudal lords under the \'Urs\' caste and divided them into hierarchical groups based on their relationship with Vokkaligas and the size of their feudal domains. The Vokkaligas were systematimatically eliminated from amongst the ruling classes. \n\nThen Chikkadevaraja violently persecuted the Lingayats (a community of shaivites of diverse caste origins, that politically dominated North Karnataka) who had risen in insurrection. An invitation was sent to all the Lingayat priests to meet the Raja at the great temples of Nunjengod, in order to discuss the conduct of their follower. Executioners who were lying in wait slaughtered\xa0 400 priests. Orders were sent to destroy over 700 Lingayat mutts on the same day. \n\nNobuhiri Ota says the Urs including the Wodeyars belonged to not only the peasant caste but were also from other castes. The Urs adopted vegetarianism, and Sanskrited themseleves as Kshatriyas. But the local Kannada Brahmins refused to coronate the Wodeyars and so they had to import a group of “Tamil Brahmins” from Srirangam to officiate the ceremony.\xa0 \n\nThe Vokkaligas and Lingayats considered the Wodeyars of an inferior cowherd caste (possibly even potter caste). Since the Wodeyars did not have kinship with the local elites, their power penetration in local arenas was severely limited. \n\nRoyal schools were set up to train the young urs elite (anglicise them) and courses included history (British version), geography, arithmetic (Traditionally mathematical knowledge was considering unnecessary for Kshatriyas), horse riding and cricket. While this improves the status of the rich urs. The gap between the poor and rich urs grew. \n\nThe wodeyars realised that it was pointless to try to convert the Urs into a powerful landed aristocracy and instead tried unsuccessfully to educate the poorer sections of their own caste members to expand their political power beyond the palace administration.\xa0 English boarding schools were also made available for poorer urs to create a gentleman class . But the poorer urs lacked the political ambition to return to the village and instead preferred jobs such as clerks and officers in the city. So mysore kingdom finally resorted to a decentralised administration, taking immense care not to ruffle the sentiments of the dominant landed gentry at the local level.\n\nQuoting James Manor "The Lingayats and Vokkaligas enjoyed an unwritten and unspoken but very real promise of non-interference from the states princely rulers who came from a cow-herding jati-indeed, some believe that they were originally potters, an even humbler caste-and who now claimed Kshatriya status."\n\nIn Part 2: I shall continue the story of how the Wodeyars through matrimonial alliances tried to buttress their mythological origin. \n\nReferences:-\n\nIkegame, Aya.

Maha Shivaratri is celebrated over three or ten days based on the Hindu lunisolar calendar. Every lunar month, there is a Shivaratri (12 per year). The main festival is called Maha Shivaratri, or great Shivaratri, which is held on the 13th night (waning moon) and the 14th day of the month Phalguna. In the Gregorian calendar, the day falls in either February or March.\n\nPopular mythology suggests that Shivratri is the convergence of **Shiva** and **Shakti**, masculine and feminine energies that provide a sense of balance to the world. It is believed that Lord Shiva, who is also known as Nataraja performed his cosmic dance Tandav on this day. Other popular beliefs also suggest Lord Shiva appeared in the form of the Linga on the midnight of Maha Shivratri. Thus, Maha Shivratri is also celebrated as the birthday of Lord Shiva.\n\nAs stated in some Mythological Scriptures, while\xa0**Samundra Manthan**\xa0a Pot of Poison emerged from the ocean. That was so terrific that all Gods and demons ran to Shiva for help Since that Poison was capable of destroying the whole Universe(Bramhand).\xa0 All prayed to Lord Shiva for saving them from the evil effects of poison. Shiva consumed the poison and held it in his throat, Having consumed lethal Poison turned Shivas\'s throat Blue in color. Subsequently, Shiva got his name as NeelKanth, the Blue throated-one. Shivratri is the celebration of this event in which Shiva saved the world.\n\nThe celebration includes "Jagran", an all-night vigil, and prayers as this night overcoming Darkness and ignorance in one\'s life through Shiva. Offerings of fruits, leaves, sweets, and milk place for Shiva.\n\nsome observe all-day-long fast and spend chanting the mantra"Om Namah Shivay" at Vedic Shiva temple.\n\nEver thought about why **Shiva** is worshipped so widely in India? Does divinity possess human form? Would you believe, if told that Shiva is nothing but a deep state of Peace?\n\nThe word Shiva means Manglam(auspicious), in fact, it has a large meaning.\n\n* Having the Potential\n* Boding well\n* Being capable of\n* Being favorable and promising\n\nShiva can be split into:\n\n* Sha + ee + Va\n* Sha stands for shareeram\xa0 or body\n* ee\xa0 stands for eeshwari or life giving energy\n* Va stands for vayu or motion.'<br />Author: 'mohnish1983'  id: 'm2j0t3'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m2j0t3/the_origin_of_shivratri_or_mahashivratri/</li>

It can either mean a title, like a Knight of Europe. Or it can mean the descendant of a royal family (mostly a bastard, since kings had many concubines but few queens and those too, not based on fertility but their social status).\n\nShould it really be a "caste" in modern indian context? For example,  Kannauj had their own Rajputs, Sialkot had their own Rajputs, Bihar had their own Rajputs while supposedly the original Rajputs originated from Mount Abu. \n\nIt looks like as if any random regional noble or kshatriya or even a wealthy, martial sudra took their caste as Rajput to "Sanskritize". \n\nLike, many educated Dravidians were brought into Vedic fold as "Brahmins" after the Persian and Steppe migration into Indus Valley civilization. \n\nRathores, Kachhwas, Chauhans, Bhatis and Sisodias can be called the original clans of Rajputs but, in Bihar, MP, Northern Punjab and Himachal, they just seem like local warriors "Sanskritizing". \n\nThoughts?'<br />Author: 'gildesh_3211'  id: 'm2h5m8'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m2h5m8/is_rajput_really_a_caste_jati_and_not_a_title/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Happy MahaShivratri! Why do so many scientists get fascinated by Bhagawan Shiva?'<br />Body: 'Oppenheimer recalled two verses from the Gita when he witnessed the first test of the atomic bomb: “If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendour of the mighty one’ and "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."\n\nUnlike the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism has no single origin story, the idea of the syncretisation of science and religion isn’t so strange. \n\n Nataraj is the ‘life force’, and it’s interesting to note that there stands a 2-metre statue of Lord Shiva at CERN, Switzerland, one of the premier research institutes of the world that holds the Large Hadron Collider.  Next to it stands a plaque by Fritjof Capra: “Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shivas in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art and modern physics.” \n\nFritjof Capra is one of the foremost proponents of the link between ‘Eastern philosophy’ and science.\n\nHe explained in *The Tao of Physics:* “The Dance of Shiva symbolises the basis of all existence. At the same time, Shiva reminds us that the manifold forms in the world are not fundamental, but illusory and ever-changing. Modern physics has shown that the rhythm of creation and destruction is not only manifest in the turn of the seasons and in the birth and death of all living creatures, but is also the very essence of inorganic matter. "According to quantum field theory, the dance of creation and destruction is the basis of the very existence of matter. Modern physics has thus revealed that every subatomic particle not only performs an energy dance, but also is an energy dance; a pulsating process of creation and destruction. For the modern physicists then, Shiva’s dance is the dance of subatomic matter, the basis of all existence and of all-natural phenomena.”\n\nAnother scientist Aidan Randle-Conde from Belgium noted in a [blog](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/11/10/in-the-shadow-of-shiva/) during his stay at CERN: “The Dancing Shiva represents the changes in the universe around us, as matter and energy constantly bump into each other, create and destroy systems and keep renewing the world."\n\nHe added: "I suppose we can attach any meaning we like to this, the constant chatter of culture, the renewal of our population as people die and children and born, the violent cosmological events that keep reorganizing the universe. Any and all of these interpretations are beautiful, powerful and majestic, but for me there is one interpretation which excites me more than any other and holds a very deep truth in it. This cosmic dance is the interaction of matter and antimatter."\n\n “Hindu religion is the only one of the world’s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt, by accident, to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma 8.64 billion years long. Longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half of the time since the Big Bang. And there are much longer time scales still." \n\n\\- [Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugyrzr5Ds8o)\n\n[Credits](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/maha-shivratri-2020-why-western-scientists-revere-lord-shiva)'<br />Author: 'hFABGjEQJNz1eVS'  id: 'm2fiam'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m2fiam/happy_mahashivratri_why_do_so_many_scientists_get/</li>

Indian (crony) industry formed \'Bombay Club\' to oppose pro-free market reforms. Unions were protesting in the streets. Harshad Mehta was scamming a fake bubble market. Inflation kept shooting.\n\n&gt;Congress did not rally behind 1991 reforms. A Congress intellectual now close to Nehru Darbar had floated the line that the reforms would serve India\'s \'Coca-Cola Class\'. Media went to town over undisclosed IMF conditionalities. Congress lost elections in State after State. \n\n&gt;To foist the claim that the 1991 reforms "spread optimism and hope across India" is a travesty. Had there been "optimism and hope" then Congress would not have lost the 1996 Lok Sabha election. Such bogus claims can be made because public memory is short. \n\n&gt;Surjit Bhalla wrote in defence of 1991 reforms and was quoted in NYT rubbishing the sly Congress campaign that PVNR\'s reforms would benefit only the \'Coca-Cola Class\'. He was brutally lampooned by the same type who are now claiming there was "optimism and hope". \n\n&gt;The LeftLiberal Commentariat and 1990s \'activist\' types like Medha Patkar derided the 1991 reforms as "neo-liberalism". Some judges also picked up this term and used it liberally in badly written orders. Opedists hogged columns denouncing PVNR for short-selling India.\n\n&gt;\'Paddy Clarke, Ha Ha Ha\', by Roddy Doyle, won the Booker in 1993. Some days later, there was a tirade against 1991 reforms in one of Lutyens\'s leading papers (I forget which one) with the headline,\'Economic Reforms, Ha Ha Ha\'. \n&gt;A bad pun, yes, but such is their intel calibre. \n\n&gt;"Optimism and hope across India after 1991 reforms."\nThe new #GreatIndianRopeTrick in town is opedists airbrushing history that is only 30 years old.

Rather we need help to get the attention of relevant   authorities. So that appropriate justice is served.**\n\n[You can use this twitter thread to retweet and tag relevent people.](https://twitter.com/thataadiguy/status/1368416597279313920)\n\nWe're  trying to get the attention of senior officials of the Uttar Pradesh  govt and U.P. Police on Twitter. Since the local bodies have failed to   provide us with the basic constitutional remedies to seek justice.   Please go through the details of the situation below and if they make   sense to you. Retweet and tag relevant people using the Twitter thread  linked above. **This concerns the future of several 21-year-old college students.**\n\n**UPDATE #1 (08/03/21)**   \\- We were able to lodge an FIR from our side on Sunday. The boys are  still in custody. The PSIT college authorities are still reluctant to  cooperate and are putting up bureaucratic barriers on our ways of  collecting potential evidence\\*\\*. We might have an FIR but we still need  your help putting pressure on Saroj Sonkar (@SarojSonkar5 on Twitter)   by bringing her actions to light to senior BJP leadership.\\*\\* Only then  any real progress will be made.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nAshutosh   Pandey was constantly being threatened with verbal and physical  assault  by Ritik Sonkar. Ever since they moved in together in the same  hostel  room during their first year in Pranveer Singh Institute of  Technology,  Kanpur. Subsequently, due to Mr Sonakr's increasingly  hostile behaviour,  the victim changed rooms to get away from him. This  only lead to  increased threats and harassment from the side of the  accused. Including  several attempts to pick fights and assault the  victim both on-campus  and off-campus grounds. The college management  got involved on a few  occasions. But they insisted on resolving the  issue internally with both  parties. Clearly, this was not a sufficient  solution as the accused  continued with prior behaviour for almost 3  years.\n\nThis  all finally came to  head when Sonkar, along with a few of his  associates, ambushed and  assaulted the victim in the middle of a city  street when he was walking  out of his exam centre. With the victim  sustaining several injuries.  Ashutosh along with his friends retaliated  in self-defence. Initially,  the authorities got involved and it was  decided by the parents from  both sides that since this was an issue  involving young college  students from both sides it was best to resolve  it using mutual  understanding. For this reason, our family didn't file  any report with  the authorities. We also suggested Ashu to continue with  his work and  maintain distance from Sonkar.\n\nHowever,    after both sides came to an agreement. Sonkar's aunt BJP MLA Saroj   Sonkar, got involved and filed an FIR against Ashutosh and those who   tried to intervene during the fight. Sonkar who belongs to the SC/ST   category has filed an FIR against Ashu and his friends under SC/ST act   and sever other IPC codes. Using, the stringent punishment under the   SC/ST act as a way to harras our families. This is a clear abuse of the   law as Sonkar was the one who perpetrated the assault and ambushed Ashu   in the middle of the street.\n\nWe've   tried to file our own cross FIR but were unsuccessful due to the   political pressure from the other side. The other side has also issued   threats to ruin the lives and careers of the young boys involved.   Meanwhile, the college management has been lukewarm towards taking any   actions as the assault did not happen on campus. Refusing to recognize   the fact that the incident happened between two of their students while   they were out for a college-related task. Also, the management failed  to  recognize the severity and effectively act on the continued conflict   over the years.\n\nAshu was  recently  offered a lucrative job offer and was supposed to go for this  training  soon. If something is not done ASAP his and his friends'  career  prospects along with their future will be in jeopardy."<br />Author: 'aaadiboiii'  id: 'm0j5cu'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/m0j5cu/repost_kanpur_college_students_need_help_getting/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Dravidian Brahmins, Indigenous Ishkvakus, Aryan Yaduvanshis, and the Out of India Theory'<br />Body: 'A reddit post in a edgy left wing Indian sub (You can find it by searching for Pargiter), got me interested in Ancient Indian History. And when I read F.E Pargiter, I found his work to be phenomenal. His work not only explains how we got the Steppe a.k.a Aryan gene. But also beautifully explains the ‘out of india’ theory and is in line with many Indian Historians who have rejected Aryan Invasion theory too.\n\nThe author says that in India post the IVC collapse there were the non-aryan kings and non-aryan Brahmins. The most important of these were the Ishkvaku/Suryavamsha Kshatriyas, located in Ayodhya, the family to which Ram belonged to.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n313/mode/2up?q=non-aryan\n\nHe says the steppe gene/aryan gene was brought into the country by another tribe, the ones who we refer to as the aila/chandravamshi lineage Kshatriyas. Krishna and the Pauravas belong to this tribe. These people did not have a separate Brahmin class,\n\nHe says the non-aryan Brahmins who composed the early vedas also seeked the patronage of the Aila/lunar kings who had conquered most of India except the eastern UP, Bihar region. When they moved west from East they recorded the rivers in that order, this is in line with the arguments most Indian historians use to discard Ayan invasion by saying the rig Veda mentions rivers in the east first and then west.\n\nSome of the lunar tribe aryan kings renounced Kshatriya hood to become Brahmins and this improved the status of Brahmins. The mixing of the lunar race Kshatriyas with Brahmins led to the aryanizatiom of Brahmins.\nThe solar and lunar tribes often fought each other and this killed off many Kshatriyas , since the first solar king to stop the hahya aryans was Ram. The Brahmins who later wrote these wars down recorded it as Parashurama killing Kshatriyas 21 times.\n\nSince the lunar dynasty invaded most of India, they led to sanskritisation of India, even the Keralas, Cholas and Pandyas claim chandravanshi lineage. This explains why the southern kings patronised Sanskrit along with the local languages. They too might have been descendants of the Ailas.\n\nAfter aryanization of India, a group of aryan tribes moved Out of India to give rise to the Iranians and took some Indic traditions along with them.\nhttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279548/page/n307/mode/2up?q=Iranian'<br />Author: 'devarajurs'  id: 'lzst3f'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lzst3f/dravidian_brahmins_indigenous_ishkvakus_aryan/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My take: What is the meaning of the word "Hindu" in the minds of 21st century Indians ?'<br />Body: 'Q. What does the word Hindu refer to in the 21st century ?\n\nA. Historically the word has been used to refer to all people living in the Indian sub-continent : to the east of river Indus, below the Himalayas and above the Indian ocean or the हिंद  महा-सागर ; and all the different religious identities that exist here. But today it is used to refer to a particular pan-Indian community of people which identifies with the religion "Hindu-ism".   \n\n\nBUT Hinduism is --and always has been-- NOT just a set of cultural traditions with a belief in multiple divine entities, like the extinct Pagan religions. The word, Hinduism, also refers to the spiritual traditions that are ingrained in Indian culture. The same culture that believes in multiple paths towards knowing God/the-divinity-within/your-ultimate-nature.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, due to Indian colonial past, this word has been downgraded to refer mainly to those cultural traditions that are considered religious today. And so a lot of people, upon hearing the word Hindu(हिंदू)/Hinduism, think of religion in the sense of how the different Abrahamic belief systems (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) define religion with a firm belief in God as supreme and with a set of strict tenets/code-of-morality.  \n\n\nAnd so you get scholars like Yuval Noah Harari, who think that Hinduism is just another set of religious belief system. They see the unhealthy social norms (e.g. caste system, sati practice) that gained prominence in Indian culture during the Muslim invasions of India  and use it to denigrate all of Hindu culture. But, among those people who think of Hinduism as just another set of religious beliefs, unfortunately, are a lot of english educated upper-middle class Indians. These Indians associate belief in any God with religious extremism, and sometimes even sneer upon the spiritual traditions of India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\'t have any hatred towards those foreigners who don\'t understand Indian culture. How could they ? It\'s far too complex to understand from outside looking in. But I can\'t help but dislike those Indians who view Hindu-ism as just another belief system. I think, those Indians should first try a bit harder to look within and ask themselves the following question : When they fight for their definition of Hinduism, what identity is propelling them to fight ? Is it  the imported "secular Indian" identity which takes its definition of secularism from Western ideas of secularism ?'<br />Author: 'curiousHomoSapien'  id: 'lzsspc'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lzsspc/my_take_what_is_the_meaning_of_the_word_hindu_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The History of Destruction of Temples and just one Babri Masjid made us communal, aggressive, and non-secular community ? Even though it was built on Temple Ruins.'<br />Body: 'Delhi Sultanate\n\nDelhi Sultanate, which extended over 320 years (1206-1526 AD), began with raids and invasion by\xa0Muhammad of Ghor. Recurrent clashes between Hindus and Muslims appear in the historical record during the\xa0Delhi Sultanate. Hindus who converted to Islam were not immune from persecution, which was illustrated by the Muslim Caste System in India as established by Ziauddin al-Barani in the Fatawa-i Jahandari.\n\nMohammed Ghori (1173-1206 AD)\n\nMohammed Ghori\xa0raided north India and the Hindu pilgrimage site\xa0Varanasi\xa0at the end of the 12th century and he continued the destruction of Hindu temples and idols that had begun during the first attack in 1194.\n\nQutb-ud-din Aibak (1206-1287 AD)\n\nHistorical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the religious violence during\xa0Mamluk dynasty\xa0ruler\xa0Qutb-ud-din Aybak. The first mosque built in Delhi, the "Quwwat al-Islam" was built with demolished parts of 20 Hindu and Jain temples. This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign.\n\nKhalji dynasty (1290-1320 AD)\n\nReligious violence in India continued during the reign of Jalaluddin Firoz Shah Khalji and Allauddin Khalji of\xa0Khalji dynasty. Their army commanders such as\xa0Ulugh Khan,\xa0Nusrat Khan,\xa0Khusro Khan\xa0and\xa0Malik Kafurattacked, killed, looted and enslaved non-Muslim people from West, Central and South India. The Khalji dynasty\'s court historian wrote (abridged).\n\nMadurai Sultanate (1335–1378)\n\nMoroccan traveler\xa0Ibn Batuta\xa0describes the cruel behaviour of the\xa0Madurai\xa0sultan Ghiyas-ud-Din Muhammad Damghani, in his memoirs. His army routinely rounded local Hindu villagers and impaling and decapitated them, indiscriminately with women and children being included. The Vijayanagar princess\xa0Gangadevi\xa0also describes the atrocities of the\xa0Madurai Sultanate\xa0towards women and children.\n\nTimur invasion of India (1398-1399)\n\nThe Turko-Mongol ruler\xa0Timur\'s attack on India was marked by systematic slaughter and other atrocities on a massive scale which were inflicted mainly on the subcontinent\'s Hindu population. His army looted Delhi, sparing only the Muslim neighbourhoods of the city. The Hindu population was massacred or enslaved. One hundred thousand Hindus prisoners were killed by his army before he attacked Delhi for fear of rebellion and many more were killed afterwards.\n\nSayyid dynasty (1414-1451)\n\nAfter the massacres of Timur, the people and lands within Delhi Sultanate were left in a state of anarchy, chaos and pestilence. The Sayyid dynasty followed, but few historical records on religious violence, or anything else for that matter, have been found. Those found, including Tarikh-i Mubarak-Shahi describe continued religious violence. Over 1414 through 1423, according to the Muslim historian\xa0Yahya bin Ahmad, the Islamic commanders "chastised and plundered the infidels" of Ahar, Khur, Kampila, Gwalior, Seori, Chandawar, Etawa, Sirhind, Bail, Katehr and Rahtors.\n\nUnder Sher Shah Suri\n\nIn 1545, Sher Shah Suri\'s army attacked the Hindu fort of\xa0Kalinjar\xa0ruled by Kirat Singh. During the attack, Per\xa0Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi\xa0Suri was burnt in an explosion and ordered his nobles to take the fort while he was still alive. His forces captured the fort by afternoon and per the account put "everyone in there to the sword"\n\nMughal Empire\n\nBabur &amp; Humayun(1526-1556)\n\nAccording to the autobiographical historical record of Emperor\xa0Babur,\xa0Tuzak-i Babari, Babur\'s campaign in northwest India targeted Hindu and Sikh civilians as well as non-Sunni sects of Islam. Immense numbers of people were killed, with the Muslim camps being described as building "towers of skulls of the infidels" on hillocks.\xa0Baburnama, similarly records massacre of Hindu villages and towns by Babur\'s Muslim army, in addition to numerous deaths of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers in the battlefields.\n\nAkbar (1556-1605)\n\nAkbar\xa0is known for his religious tolerance. However, in early years of his reign, religious violence included the massacre of Hindus of Garha in 1560 AD, under the command of Mughal Viceroy Asaf Khan. Other campaigns targeted Chitor and Rantambhor. Maulana Ahmad, the historian of that era, wrote of the battle at Chitor fort,\n\nThey (Hindus) committed\xa0jauhar\xa0(...). In the night, the (Muslim) assailants forced their way into the fortress in several places, and fell to slaughtering and plundering. At early dawn the Emperor went in mounted on an elephant, attended by his nobles and chiefs on foot. The order was given for a general massacre of the infidels as a punishment. The number exceeded 8,000 (Abu-l Fazl states there were 40,000 peasants with 8,000 Rajputs forming the garrison). Those who escaped the sword, men and women, were made prisoners and their property came into the hands of the Musulmans.\n\n—\n\nMaulana Ahmad, Tarikh-i Alfi\n\nAurangzeb (1658–1707)\n\nThe reign of\xa0Aurangzeb\xa0witnessed one of the strongest campaigns of religious violence in the Mughal Empire\'s history. Aurangzeb re-introduced\xa0jizya\xa0(tax) on non-Muslims, led numerous campaigns of attacks against non-Muslims, forcibly converted Hindus to Islam and destroyed Hindu temples. However, he also built many temples. Scholars like\xa0Ram Puniyani\xa0states that Aurangzeb was not always fanatically anti-Hindu, and kept changing his policies depending on the needs of the situation. He banned the construction of new temples, but permitted the repair and maintenance of existing temples. He also made generous donations of\xa0jagirs\xa0to several temples to win the sympathies of his Hindu subjects. There are several\xa0firmans (orders) in his name, supporting temples and\xa0gurudwaras, including\xa0Mahakaleshwar temple\xa0of\xa0Ujjain, Balaji temple of\xa0Chitrakoot,\xa0Umananda Temple\xa0of\xa0Guwahati\xa0and the\xa0Shatrunjaya\xa0Jain\xa0temples.\n\nTipu Sultan\n\nTipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus, Christians with the\xa0Mappila Muslims\xa0and carried out forced conversions of Hindus and Christians. According to C. K. Kareem, Tippu Sultan issued an edict for the destruction of Hindu temples in\xa0Kerala. The portrayal of Tipu Sultan as a religious bigot has been also disputed by some sources suggesting that he in fact often embraced religious pluralism.\n\nSource Quora :- https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-hate-between-Hindus-and-Muslims-in-India/answer/Muhammad-Aamir-Khokhar?ch=10&amp;share=676452a2&amp;srid=aabSx'<br />Author: 'CURRENTNEWSTIMES'  id: 'lxhyd5'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lxhyd5/the_history_of_destruction_of_temples_and_just/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Does Myanmar's geography affect its political instability? What can that tell us about India?"<br />Body: "**Geography** **is Destiny** is a term known by everyone who learns geopolitics. Often times, its hard to see the correlation and causation, hence the doubt by some people. \n\nIn the case of Indochina, this vast geographic area that includes Northeast India, we could observe some common patterns throughout this region that is less-prevalent outside of it. One big pattern that I want to highlight is the **strong tribal mentality**, which suggests that its difficult to create a common shared identity in this region. \n\nThe reason this happens may be due to the dense jungle and hilly terrain of this region. Food was never a problem for these tribes because of the lush forest and fertile soil, while hills made it difficult to trade and interact with different tribes. \n\nIn the case of Myanmar, its politics has been internally turbulent for decades. A longstanding military rule, which is a pattern shared throughout the region, tells us that its difficult to create and sustain a democracy. The complete rejection and banishment of certain groups like the Rohingyas tells us about how intense the tribalism can be. \n\nIndia also has tribalism in the form of caste and religion, but its less intense, in part because of India's slightly drier climate and flatter terrain, which forces and helps to connect with various groups. A stable political system and a common identity isn't so difficult to create.

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Exports under Narendra Modiji'<br />Body: "**India's exports for the year at the end of different years**   \n\nDate | India's Exports (Billions USD)\n---|---\n31-12-2003 | 90.84   \n31-12-2008 | 288.9 \n31-12-2013 | 472.18   \n31-12-2019 | 528.3\n\nUsing this, we calculate growth in exports during UPA1, UPA2, Combined 2 terms of UPA &amp;amp; also during Modiji's years.   \n\n\n-----------------               \n**The different time periods/Terms**    \n\nSince only yearly data is available &amp;amp; it wouldn't exactly match with the start or end of the political term, I approximate the following dates as the different terms.  \n\nDates | Terms\n---|---\n31-12-2003 to 31-12-2008 | UPA1\n31-12-2008 to 31-12-2013 | UPA2\n31-12-2003 to 31-12-2013 | Combined UP1 &amp;amp; UPA2\n31-12-2013 to 31-12-2019 | Modiji    \n\n\n-----------------               \n\n**Cumulative Growth in the different Terms**    \n\nFirst let's do total cumulative growth of India's exports during different terms - This is pretty simple - if in 2010 it was Rs. 100 &amp;amp; it grew to Rs. 150 by 2015, then the growth is 50% cumulative over 5 years.  \n\n\n\n | Cumulative Growth  \n---|---\nUPA1 | 218.04%\nUPA2 | 63.44%\nCombined UPA | 419.8% \n**Modiji** | **11.88%**  \n\n-----------------               \n\n**CAGR of Exports in Different terms**   \nCumulative growth may not always be the best way to compare two different periods if they are not the same duration (for e.g. 5 years of UPA2 with 6 years of Modi). Here it's not relevant of course because both UPA1 &amp;amp; UPA2 kicked Narendrabhai inspite of being 1 year lesser. \n\nHowever, let's still calculate CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate - i.e. how much is the average year on year Growth. This will make the comparison easier because the number of years in the terms is now normalized by calculating the average yearly growth   \nTaking the same example as before - Let's say our exports were Rs. 100 in 2010 &amp;amp; Rs. 150 in 2015, then average annual growth is 8.45% (calculated using the Compounding formula)   \n\n\n\n | Average Yearly Growth Rate\n---|---\nUPA1 | 26.04%\nUPA2 | 10.32%\nCombined UPA | 17.92%\n**Modiji** | **1.89%**      \n----------------------              \n\n**Comparison with the world**     \n\nWorld Export Growth crashed during both UPA2 &amp;amp; Modiji's term. But as a developing country/emerging economy, we were never competing with the world export figures. As an emerging economy we were expected to do much better than the world exports (developed nations &amp;amp; also very backward nations don't have much growth so they always pull the world figures down).\n\nFor e.g. in UPA2 also world exports growth rate had gone down from earlier highs. But even during UPA2, India's CAGR growth rate was nearly 3x times of World Exports CAGR. Now, under Modiji our CAGR is not even 2x of World Exports CAGR. \n\nSeveral countries with Good Governance are performing far better than both India &amp;amp; the World in 31-12-2013 to 31-12-2019\n\nCountry | CAGR | Cumulative   \n---|---|----\n**Modiji** | **1.89%** | **11.88%** \nBurma^[1] | 14.36% | 95.6%         \nIreland | 12.18% | 99.31% \nVietnam | 11.81% | 95.35%   \nCambodia | 8.6% | 74.2%   \nBangladesh |7.95% | 58.21%\nPhillipines | 6.23% | 30.40%   \nSri Lanka | 4.29% | 28.64% \n\n\n\n[1] Only 5 years data is available as compared 6 for other countries   \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------                      \n- **Exports grew at an average of 17.92% each year during UPA.**      \n- **Exports grew at an average of 1.89% each year during Narendrabhai.**   \n\n\nAll data taken from https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/exports &amp;amp; https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.CD"<br />Author: 'totestsuswop'  id: 'lxd3gu'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lxd3gu/indian_exports_under_narendra_modiji/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[discussion] Which side of Indian History do you subscribe to and what are the reasons you believe it is true?'<br />Body: "Hi, I hope to have a positive  discussion than a charged one. I am kind of new to studying History (it  was never my favourite subject but have to read it for job exams). So  far the impression I got from reading about History and Historians of  India is that there are two narratives: a Left Wing one (usually called a  Marxist narrative which describes History as a class struggle if I am  not wrong) and a Right wing one (usually called Hindutvadi narrative  which describes History, especially medieval Indian History as a  struggle along religious lines). From reading about them, I get the  following impression:\n\n1. In  Left wing History, Hindus, especially Brahmins, are the antagonists.  Muslims came to India, flourished, spread Arts, culture, music,  literature (like Sufi ones), allowed Hindus to create Bhakti movement,  sometimes destroyed temples and stuff but they were mostly 'strategic'  (I read this in a Print article from Audrey...forgot her title), as in  trying to establish a stable State. However, Hindus were bad, sometimes  used to fight with innocent Muslims, the Brahmins used to betray and  oppress dalits, and when they came to power they used to oppress Muslims  too, like Dogra Hindus used to exploit Kashmiri Muslims, etc. Some say  Mughals united India and gave rise to economic and agricultural reforms  like in Bengal. They also say that Hindus used to fight among themselves  too like Bagris plundered Bengal in 18th century.\n2. In  Right wing History, Muslims are the villains. According to them, India  was already united under Chandragupta Maurya and everything was fine  until Islamic rulers like Sultanate, followed by Mughals, came to India.  According to them, they revived sex slavery/concubinage and slavery in  general, forced women in India to wear more conservative clothes,  destroyed Hindu temples, tortured Sikhs and Hindus, looted India, forced  conversions to Islam in India, etc while Hindus were innocent silent  watchers and generally tried to maintain peace (contrary to what I think  in Left wing narrative, Muslims are the ones trying to maintain peace). In  Right wing narrative, the villain in the whole Kashmir Insurgency  fiasco are the Muslims, not pandits, who wanted an Islamic State and  that's why forced Hindus out of there (contrary to Left wing narrative  that Dogras were discriminatory on Muslims and that is why they turned  against Hindus).\n\nMy  question is which 'side' of History, if I may put it like that, are you  and why do you believe that? Honestly, Idk, I have no way to confirm who  is telling the truth and who is not. I am not a Historian and I usually  study whatever is in the recommended books or school books. I am ngl, I  had charged opinions on History back when I was on Twitter but soon  found that I am not equipped to argue since History is not something I  have read quite a lot (last time I studied History was for class 10).\n\nI hope (I can only hope) that the discussion/replies will be civil.

      <li>Title::: 'Why India DOES NOT need a Population Control law.'<br />Body: '  \n\nWhy India should not have population control/ 2 child policy.\n\n“Most of india’s problems are due to its population” this is a statement I made myself some time ago. Infact, many indians all have heard Indian complain about Indians “population explosion”. Some like Yog guru baba ramdev even suggesting “Third child should be devoid of voting rights, government facilities”. Not only this, recently in 2019 a population control bill was put forward in the parliament by Rakesh sinha and more recently an amendment put forward by Anil desai, Shiv sena MP.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population\\_Control\\_Bill,\\_2019\n\nIn this post I would argue why india should not, rather MUST NOT have a apopulation control law.\n\n1. DON’T PLAY WITH HUMANS: If you consider human beings as society you will relaise that as a collective body of 7 billion people, as a planet, as a society we act as a an average individual human. Let me explain, it is a fact that human’s hit their peak productivity in terms of physical health, career and well being. Slowly from that generally speaking we start to decline in physical health and in career too in many cases for ex athletes, Workers, Brick layers usually cant continue with the same pace after 40. After that we eventually die out. Same goes for our society, a society of 7 billion people collective acts in a similar manner. According to the world bank, human population will reach 9.7 billion in 2050.(Source: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200715150444.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200715150444.htm)) The gdp of the whole human civilization which stands at 80 trillion dollars would peak at the same time and guess what that is the time the average age of human beings on this planet would be close to 40 years. This phenomenon when applied to countries is called demographic dividend.\n\n2. THE CONSEQUENCES: Here comes the most interesting part. So we all have heard about how one/ two child policy in Singapore, South Korea, Japan and most importantly China has brought economic growth and prosperity. It is certainly true that the success and prosperity of these countries to an extent can be attributed to population control but that is just half of the story. So what is the other half? For that we will have to take a look at Japan and South Korea\n\n· JAPAN: Japan and South Korea were the first major asian powers to become developed countries. Japan produced great companies like Toyota, Sony Honda, Mitsubishi, Panasonic etc, whil South Korea produced giants like Hyundai, Samsung, etc. Without a doubt these two nations are the most prosperous nations in Asia, they achieved that prosperity in a very short while, japan recovered from the war, industrialized and developed in merely 40 year 1950-1990, infact just like china is today, Japan too was poised to over take USA as the biggest economy in the world. The new York times published articles like “Is Japan Out to Get Us?”( [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/books/is-japan-out-to-get-us.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/books/is-japan-out-to-get-us.html)). At its peak, there was so much wealth in japan that the real estate market of Tokyo had some pretty crazy anomalies. In the late 80’s it was estimated that the imperial palace covering an area of 3.4 square kilometers in central Tokyo had a real estate land value greater than all of the real estate in California. Of course, the imperial palace was never for sale and this was based on the cost per. But to the surprise of many, Japan just STOPPED. It literally did! Japans GDP has remained about the same adjusted for inflation in past 30 years. Japan hasn’t seen ANY growth, but still it continues to be prosperous. Why you may ask? Because its population also hasn’t grown. The current and the future of jaan however seems grim. As life expectancy increased so did the number of old people, in all fairness economically speaking old people don’t add anything to the economy usually, they spend wisely(read cheap), don’t invest much, and depend upon pensions which are paid for by the current working population. This problem is expected to aggravated as even today birth rates in japan remain one of the lowest in the world which has resulted in the japnese govt starting a arrange marriage scheme(Not even joking, lol)\n\n· China: Deng Xiaoping once said, “ The 21st century may not be Asia’s” and that fear may be coming true atleast in case of China. Let me start with a few numbers. The US has a GDP per capita of about 65,000 USD while China has a GDP per capita of about 10,000 USD. But here’s the catch, the avg age of an American is 38 years old ( as mentioned earlier this is the peak productivity age of a nation) and that of an average Chinese is 38.4 years! Japan and South Korea had the same avg age in 1990, and we know what happened thereafter. With the rate this avg age is increasing in china, by 2030 an average Chinese is estimated to be older than an avg American! Therefore, the industry workers that made china boom when retiring would result in a huge pension debt which would be paid for by lesser number of people due to one child policy, which would increase their work load and in turn reduce their birth rate.\n\n3. IS THERE EVEN A NEED?: India, already has a birth rate of close to 2.3 just 0.2 above the sustenance birth rate of 2.1. A population control would only hamper the long term growth of the country. Rather what developing countries like india should focus upon is the natural process of demographic dividend and growth. A prime example of which is the United States.\n\n4. ARE YOU SERIOUS?: Well, the fact that we are looking at humans as numbers really tells us something about our modern world. Is it even morally correct to tell someone to have less kids? Is it a good idea to kill/maltreat a baby which has just born without a fault of his own just because he/she is an unwanted child in the eyes of the government.\n\nAND MOST IMPORTANTLY,\n\nWhy should we give the government so much power? A population control law is violation of human rights on several scales!'<br />Author: 'astute9988'  id: 'lwyahl'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lwyahl/why_india_does_not_need_a_population_control_law/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Happy World Wildlife Day! Here are some fun facts about India's National Identity Symbols."<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Royal Bengal Tiger dethroned the lion as India’s national animal in 1973. The tiger was chosen when the government launched Project Tiger that year. The idea was to boost conservation of this highly endangered animal\n2. The Great Indian Bustard almost became the national bird of India. It was a strong contender but misspelling its name could make it sound like a common expletive! So the government decided on the Indian peafowl as the national bird, in 1963.\n3. India’s National Aquatic Animal: Ganges River Dolphin, a fresh-water mammal found in the Ganga. An endangered species, it was chosen in 2010, to create awareness and save it from extinction.\n4. The next time you scoop up a spoonful of curd or yoghurt, spare a thought for this mouthful – ‘Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus’. Believe it or not, it’s the ‘National Microbe of India’, one of India’s National Identity Symbols. It’s what turns milk into curd. The National Microbe of India was chosen by children in a poll conducted as a special train called the ‘Science Express Biodiversity Special’ halted at stations across the country. The poll was organised by the Government of India in 2012.\n5. The elephant was named India’s National Heritage Animal in 2010. A symbol in Indian culture, religion, history and mythology, it was selected as a National Identity Symbol to raise its status and increase conservation efforts.'<br />Author: 'hFABGjEQJNz1eVS'  id: 'lwqrzj'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lwqrzj/happy_world_wildlife_day_here_are_some_fun_facts/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Book Review: Gunahon ka Devta by Dharmveer Bharti'<br />Body: "To all the readers who swoon over the love of Hazel-Gus, Liz-Darcy, Heathcliff and Cathy, believe me you have experienced nothing if you haven't read about Chander and Sudha. We Indians have a really bad habit of cribbing how great Western culture is and how we lack. But, we seldom are aware of the gems collecting dust in the mildewed attic of our forgetfulness.\n\nHere are\xa0 points why you should read Gunahon ka Devta:\n\n1. The protagonist: Western books often present a brooding bad boy who is transformed by the love of his life. Here, our protagonist is a serious young man having lofty ideals. Frankly, his goodness and pure character at the beginning of the book was so refreshing. The corruption of his character from being a pure, innocent Devta to a Pret, Gunahon ka Devta is something that will create a heaviness in your heart. Chander's negative character arc is tragically beautiful.\n\n2. Love story between Chander and Sudha: There's no love at first sight here. Instead there's the love the creeps on your soul and you don't even realize how every fibre of you has become entwined with that love. Though many people complain that the love between them is patriarchal, I beg to differ. Yes, Sudha worships Chander as Devta but not because he's a man, but due to the loftiness of his character. Yes, Chander dictates Sudha where to go, but it is only because Chander is older than her and more mature and acts like a guardian to Sudha. There are also discussions on how caste system is the cause of separation between the lovers, but if you have an understanding of Indian society, Chander considered Sudha's father as his parent and hence, could not break his trust by keeping a conjugal relationship with Sudha. Also, his relationship with Sudha had fraternal undertones and he couldn't bear the thought of mixing sex with their pure relationship.\n\n3. Haunting secondary characters: Be it Anglo Indian Pammi and her brother Bertie, Binati, Buaji, Bisariya, Dr. Shukla, each character has its own nuances and depth and\xa0character arcs which haunt the reader days after he has finished the novel.\n\n4. Exquisite imagery: Did I mention how exquisitely Bharti Ji painted the setting and the imagery is so vivid that you feel you yourself are there with the characters. Especially the scene at Lake with Chander and Pammi.\n\nOverall, this novel is a masterpiece and everyone should read it once in a lifetime.\n\n\nHave you read the book?

Since years I have noticed that the majority of the Indian film industry has been producing trash. Commercial movies with no thought behind the impact film making should have and the beauty of story telling has gone down the gutter with this. The kind of potential this industry has to make real change with their movies over cultural, taboo topics which need serious awareness is HUGE considering their popularity and influence. Anyway many Indians still lose their sanity when they see an actor/actress. I mean we all have seen how crowds gather in front of sub par performers’ residences in Mumbai. Recently I saw an interview where this gentlemen begged Amitabh Bachchan to name his child. Should we blame the public or the media? \nMoving on to the topic that troubles me the most, of course with the farmers protest many celebs came forward with #standwithindia. Generically orchestrated copy paste tweets which imo was embarrassing to say the least. I even saw an interview of Narendra Modi by Akshay Kumar who literally asked the PM how he drinks his tea? (I’ll leave it at that). Why do we dish out money from our pocket to fund mostly uneducated celebrities who are too scared to stand up for their country. \nKangana Ranaut however is another case, she has a serious superiority complex and lack of humility and gratitude and spends time arguing with the public, the same public who put her where she is. \nTo conclude these people aren’t extraordinary and I can’t really blame them for where they are because it’s our fault.'<br />Author: 'bxdbobz_29'  id: 'lw84o2'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lw84o2/why_is_bollywood_still_revered/</li>

The unemployment rate of India was reported to have reached a 45 year high of 6.1% in the financial year of 2017–2018. The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy stated the unemployment rate to be 8.45% with a rate of 37.48% for the 20–24 age group and 12.81% for the 25–29 age group in October 2019. According to the 2019 report of the Pew Research Center, 393.7 million jobs are in a vulnerable state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Oxfam India data states that the richest 1% of the population\'s control over the country\'s wealth increased from 58% to 73% between 2018 and 2019, while the wealth of the poorest 50% increased by 1%. According to Nisha Agarwal, CEO of Oxfam India, "the billionaire boom is not the sign of a thriving economy but the symptom of a failing economic system".\n\nCan you all justify if such an economic paralysis over UPA\'s policy paralysis is good for the nation or if it can be recovered without much of a trouble in the future? We need reforms, we need properly amended with less loop-holes (if at all they are) and less-rushed reforms/amendments as implemented in the last couple of years. The Government seems to have forgot about the welfare of the citizens. \n\nWhat are your opinions on this? *Please do not go out of your way to personally attack me for the post, this will benefit neither of us.

Now I have a few questions in mind.\n\nThis Bill accepts only people of certain communities who entered India \\[1.\\] before Dec 31, 2014 and \\[2.\\] entered as refugees.\n\nThe two criteria have to be satisfied (as per the CAA) to be granted a place in this nation. The Intelligence Bureau has [data for only 31k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019#Analysis). SL Tamils and other communities have to be considered. As per [this](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-has-made-6-lakh-refugees-forever-stateless-says-rights-group/article31103492.ece) article, 1 lac Tibetans, 1 lac Chins from Myanmar, 40k Rohingyas and another 40k unclassified refugees are in peril and this does not include the Muslim refugees. While 3 lac SL Tamils are there still as refugees, the SL Govt. has said that they can return anytime they want. \n\nUnder the NRC/NPR (the latter of which is still not drafted albeit mentioned in the Gazette), current Indian citizens will be considered a part of the country. But absolutely without (critical) documents? For the record, almost 19 lacs were rendered stateless upon failing to prove their citizenship in Assam. Now extrapolate.\n\nThey are not Indians but given we let them stay for decades, it will be unjust to throw them away or act in the way it happened in Assam - put in detention camps. They need not (and should not) be treated as National Citizens but rather as refugees or asked to apply for Citizenship as a foreign national in years to come. Eventually we need to close the borders and reject entry of migrants from all corners of the nation. I am not completely against this but it needs proper amendments without which it is certainly an evil trap for many. It seems very rushed.\n\n*The point of this question is to get your views, opinions and to know if I am missing out on something, there is not point in attacking me.*'<br />Author: 'woooshywsh'  id: 'lu1eew'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lu1eew/lets_talk_about_the_cab_again/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India can no longer function with a weak, liberal government. Change my mind.'<br />Body: "From my observation, countries that are nation states with a common identity and natural borders typically have a benign government while those that don't have an authoritarian government. Its a spectrum where the less the country looks like a nation state, the more authoritarian the leader in the country gets, beyond that the country plunges into political instability. \n\nIn the case of India, I'm sure everyone agrees that the current government is more heavy-handed than the previous one in all branches of power. I think this is happening because there's no other way to manage India. What's causing the instability is the sheer population of the country, which shot up fourfolds since independence. \n\nStill, India is more natural than many other countries in the world. China for example needs complete autocracy to be managed, the same with Russia. Indonesia is also less politically stable because of the over 10000 islands that creates very divergent identities. There are also countries like India that are becoming more authoritarian like US and Brazil."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'lts2yd'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lts2yd/india_can_no_longer_function_with_a_weak_liberal/</li>

Not gonna lie, since I was trading for the first time, I made some losses. After analysing why, I came to 3 conclusions why I made losses. One, even when I ended the day with minimal profit, I lost money because of too many transactions per day. Second, I didn't stick to my analysis sometimes because of emotions. Third, stop-loss errors- I didn't know where to put stop losses. Most of the time, I hit my stop losses and later on the price would rebound and touch where I had put a sell/buy order. So I had started with 15k and lost around 2k. So I was left with balance 13k or so, after which I somehow decided to continue with my preperation for UPSC because that was my childhood dream.

      <li>Title::: 'Vanchinathan - The forgotten part of struggle for Indian independence'<br />Body: 'On 17th June 1911 a young man barely 25 years went to the platform at Maniyachi Junction where the 9:30 AM was going to come. There he stood in front of Collector **Robert William d’ Escourt Ashe** and this was no accident. The young man wearing a green coat and a white dhoti took out his Browning automatic pistol and shot the Ashe point-blank after which he ran into the toilet on the platform and shot himself. This young man was **Vanchinathan**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Who was Vanchinathan?\n\nVanchinathan was born in 1886 in Semgottai to the house of Raghupathy Iyer and Rukmani Ammal. He was a hardworking boy from a young age. When he turned 22 in 1908 he joined durbar service as temple accountant at Ariankavu and then a few months later was appointed forest ranger at Punalur.\n\nJust two years after in the year 1910 Vanchinathan found out about a branch of **Bharatmatha Association which was formed in Punalur**. Neelakanta Brahmachari had formed this branch with the sole goal of Swarajya and Independent India. **Vanchinathan joined this movement and became an integral part of this branch**. He was inspired by the ideals of Neelakanta Brahmachari and the revolutionary literature from Pondicherry.\n\nAfter becoming a member of the branch, **he got to visit Pondicherry and meet the famous Indian revolutionary V.V.S Iyer**, under whom he learned how to use a firearm along with many things to help him in the fight against the British Empire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why assassinate Robert William d’ Escourt Ashe?\n\nDuring this V O Chidambaram Pillai was a leading man in the Swadeshi movement in Tuticorin. He was at the point the epitome of a man trying to help his nation in every way possible. He had started his own Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company, had few mills, and was also leading the labour movement against the British Government. His mere presence had become a thorn in the eyes of the British. In retaliation, the Colonial Collector Robert William d’ Escourt Ashe had launched a series of attacks against Chidambaram Pillai. Ashe tried everything in his power to crush the swadeshi movement, he tried shutting down the company and even arrested Chidambaram Pillai along with other revolutionaries. When people protested he gave orders to shoot the peaceful protestors.\n\nAshe played used all sorts of treachery and since he had put Chidambaram Pillai in Jail and now **he was finally able to close the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company**. Chidambaram Pillai even mention this in his autobiography –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When the junior sub-assistant in Jail asked me if I know Ashe, I told him that I know Ashe very well. He asked me how. ‘He is the reason for me being here and death of my shipping company in Tuticorin’ was the answer given by me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe youth and the freedom fighters could no longer accept this cruelty of not being able to live a good life in their Motherland. And Vanchinathan was the one who decided to put an end to the deeds of Ashe.\n\nAfter the assassination of Ashe, Vanchinathan decided that he would rather die than get in hands of colonizers and therefore he shot himself. **A letter was recovered from his pocket in which he states the reasoning for doing so.**\n\nThe letter goes like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone responsible for this.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mlechas of England having captured our country, tread over the sanathana dharma of the Hindus and destroy them. Every Indian is trying to drive out the English and get swarajyam and restore sanathana dharma. Our Raman, Sivaji, Krishnan, Guru Govindan, Arjuna ruled our land protecting all dharmas, but in this land, they are making arrangements to crown George V, a mlecha, and one who eats the flesh of cows.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Three thousand Madrasis have taken a vow to kill George V as soon as he lands in our country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In order to make others know our intention, I who am the least in the company, have done this deed this day. This is what everyone in Hindustan should consider it as his duty.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of cow-eater King George V in this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to make them understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this sacred land.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I, as the least of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;VandeMataram. VandeMataram. VandeMataram  \n&gt;  \n&gt;R. Vanchi Aiyar, Shencottah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Controversy\n\nBut nowadays such bravery is now being tarnished, the legacy, of a young man barely 25 who gave his life for the Swadeshi movement, for the Independence struggle of India, is being ruined all because of Political agendas.\n\nSections from Tamil Nadu have started to ruin the name of Vanchinathan, stating that he killed Ashe not because the oppressive Colonial Ashe was trying to destroy the Swadeshi movement but because Ashe was helping the backward castes. Trying to taint the legacy of Vanchinathan.\n\nEven though no such evidence exists and no such claims were made in 90+ years after the British collector was shot down. People had only started in recent years to further their political ambitions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**But bravery is never forgotten and neither shall we forget the young man who gave his life for his Motherland Vanchinathan.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S - If you find any factual mistake   in the above article please feel free to correct.

And no, this conflict has nothing to do with religions, its all about the Indic culture.\n\nThose were the times of the *Macaulay Puttars*. If the founders had named their hospital Dhanvantari instead (based on the Hindu God of medicine, Lord Vishnu's incarnation), the impression most educated and posh Indians might have had would be that of some old and rugged municipality building where patients are treated with apathy and neglect, isn't it?\n\nI'd like to think that the old and misguided perception is changing today and the Indic culture is also evolving and being taken seriously by most Indians but is it really?

      <li>Title::: "Discuss: India is a country with deep structural and systematic problems. Unless that changes we'll remain perpetually mediocre at best."<br />Body: "I'm writing this post to share how hopeless sometimes I feel about our country. It's all good and shiny at surface but if we honestly think about it we find we have so many deep structural issues and I don't see anything happening to change that.  \nI guess everyone here agrees we want India to be in league of other developed countries. We think that if utterly poor countries like China &amp; S Korea can grow so fast why we can't? We surely can but those countries had certain fundamental things right even then which we don't even now.  \n\n\nBut think yourself. How long do you think it will take India to get rid of the current state of our politics, our bureaucracy, disgusting system of reservation, our police system, our judicial system and so many other problems? Can we ever get rid of the people who live on subsidies and doles from government? How long will it take for our public education infrastructure to be anywhere near to being somewhat functional?  \n\n\nHow long do you thing will take to transform our agriculture and make it profitable? Agriculture is a topic in itself and I'll just say our farmers are an entitled lot and they are victim of their own doings. Our farming is same as it was in medieval times. It's simple math an industry with just 15% share of GDP can't support 50% of the population.  \n\n\nDo you think our cities with 3rd class infrastructure and utterly poor urban planning can ever be transformed? They don't even compare to tier 3 cities in other countries. It's just absolute chaos. Even countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines look cleaner and much more orderly &amp; systematic. Our cities are literally just slums. Reason is the way our local city governance is, utterly useless and dysfunctional. In those countries mayors have full independence, responsibility &amp; accountability. Here they are just for namesake.  \n\n\nHere I'm not even talking about corruption, policies, ease of doing business, infrastructure etc. These things are a consequence, they are not the reason. You can fix these things eventually but can you fix the things I mentioned? Can we become a truly prosperous country without fixing them? Let me tell unless we fix those we'll end up being a mediocre economy like Brazil or Russia. This tag of fastest growing major economy is a farce. Being such a poor country we have very low base so 6-7% growth is no big deal. 8-10% is what is needed at minimum. At the minimum we need around $15000 per capita to be called somewhat rich which means around 8 times the current per capita. Developed countries all have 30K+ per capita, US's is 60k+. We are an absolutely poor country at this point. All figures are in nominal terms.  \n\n\nAll that said I'm not saying everything is bad or nothing is gonna change. But the point is not about doing just fine. At current pace we'll continue to be mediocre in every way. Our goal should be to breakout and be an outstanding example like China &amp; S Korea. To be honest I don't see that kind of willpower or commitment either in leadership or in society except some exceptions like Yogi. I truly admire him and wish everyone was as decisive and unapologetic as he is."<br />Author: 'abhiccc2'  id: 'lrig9g'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/lrig9g/discuss_india_is_a_country_with_deep_structural/</li>

Why do we have to be proud of something we didn't actually do? Take pride in something you've actually done, do something for India and take pride in it. I'm a Marathi and in Maharashtra, we have something called Maratha pride. People who can't even be 1/300th of Shivaji Maharaj take pride in it and are ready to fight for him. Their contribution to the society: Zero. Shivaji would rather want them to be an active part of the society than to fight with a person who called him Shivaji instead of Shivaji Maharaj. Make a change in the world and be proud of it, instead of being proud of something we had no control over. Why should a Jatt get proud when he's just lazy, drinking booze all day, but yeah, never forgets to write about his pride on his Car. Then what about Dalits and peasants, what will they take pride in? Be happy about something you have, don't take excessive pride in it. Call spades a spades.\n\nFeat.

I love this, because that allows me to not get involved at all in the homemaking, something I am completely content not doing. Most importantly, Shalini has a wonderful relationship with my parents.
