      <li>Title::: 'Examples of how Hindus face constitution-sanctioned second-class treatment in India'<br />Body: '&gt;– Hindus have no right to set up their educational institutions while minorities do.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Minorities have the right to govern themselves based on their own laws while Hindus have to follow a common code. This and the above is why you have the example of many Hindu groups asking for minority status.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Major Hindu temples that have been destroyed and replaced by churches or masjids have no right to ask for a reversion to the original structure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– (Mostly) Hindu land captured by Islamic tyrants and British colonizers and given subsequently to Waqf boards and Churches have no right for recapture by the modern democratic state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Constitutional muzzling of any criticism of Abrahamic beliefs, supported by muscle power on the street that only allows for one-way traffic of abuse of Hindu Gods, beliefs, and practices.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– A judiciary that rules through an Abrahamic lens of ‘essential practices’ which by its very nature, seeks to erase the diversity of Hinduism. In the absence of ‘one true book, one true prophet’ Hindu practices can mostly be deemed not essential and hence banned.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Institutionalized support for increasing fissures in Hindu society through an unfair reservations system. A system that incentivizes brain drain and forces students to go to faraway lands to pursue higher studies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;More specifically, Articles 25 – 30 of the Indian constitution serve as a double sword – one that cuts down Hindu society at the knees and lifts up minorities through state-sanctioned support. One must read those Articles (to get the full effect, the reader may choose to read these rapid-fire, in the voice of Anand Ranganathan).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While Articles 25 – 30 sound rosy in their titles, the interpretations are poisonous for Hindu society. Here is each article and a summary of what it means in reality:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 25. Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion. The detailed text clearly calls out Hindu heathens as needing to be civilized and this clause is what enables States to take over temple boards.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 26. Freedom to manage religious affairs. Enables parallel systems such as Sharia law to be setup.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 27. Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion. Enables institutions such as Churches to avoid paying taxes for the common good while Hindu temple boards already get ensnared based on Article 25.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 28. Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions. While this clause has not been actively utilized by Hindu haters, expect court cases to come up to challenge any references or teaching of dharmic values and practices such as Yoga in schools.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 29. Protection of interests of minorities. Explicit promotion of minority rights versus common protection for all faiths, cultures, and linguistic groups.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Article 30. Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions. This article and its tyrannical child, the Right to Education Act, enable minorities to set up their own institutions but deny the same to Hindus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.opindia.com/2022/03/snare-fundamentalists-spare-fundamentals-indian-constitution/](https://www.opindia.com/2022/03/snare-fundamentalists-spare-fundamentals-indian-constitution/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0chqe/yesterday\\_a\\_post\\_got\\_voted\\_to\\_the\\_top\\_posting/](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0chqe/yesterday_a_post_got_voted_to_the_top_posting/)'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'tphinp'<br />Score:299<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tphinp/examples_of_how_hindus_face/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'What is up with China wrt its stance on India?'<br />Body: 'China and its mouth piece Global Times have been looking to post a variety of pro India opinions. Further, its Foreign Minister dropped while out and about in the region. However, this softer approach has changed little on ground. What might be reason behind this tacit disconnect between Chinese softening of stance in meetings and print but not on ground?\n\nI can think of a few reasons:\n\n1. Troubles at home. Xi hasn’t left for a day apart from Myanmar Army Day since Covid hit first TWO YEARS AGOAGGHGHGHGH.\n2. China is majorly an economic power. Chinese military has been  documented to be highly demoralized. After one child policy, it was not  wise to send the only child to military to die at the hands of Indian  veers and veeranginis. It is felt that only the worst kids end up in the  military. So, direct confrontation is not an option for them. That is  why they expand slowly but build roads and such fast.\n3. India’s foreign policy standing currently. It has increased  considerably. After a major reaction from West, China has not been able  to stand neutral as much as India has.\n4. Further, independent of India, China has excelled economically by  slowly buying a lot of Western brands and pumping new money. This has  been directly dealt with in Russian case by forcing transfer. For  example, sale of Chelsea by Abrahmovich.\n5. Pakistani chutzpah. Pakistan’s army head who was in charge of CPEC  has reportedly swindled most of Chinese money to his personal Swiss  accounts. So, they sent their own labor to work on CPEC. Like most other  Chinese projects. Killed in terrorist attacks. Pakistan is so down  trodden that they cannot repay a single Yuan they have received from  China.\n\nAll of this hints to something far fetched, China wants a new BRI.  Afaik, India is not steadfastly against BRI. The Indian gripe, justly,  is the route going through PoK and India not being asked about it.  Pakistan basically gave part of PoK to China but all of it is of India  so the sale is null and void.\n\nNow, with a major infrastructural pipeline being developed and major  investments pouring in from Japan, etc for building infrastructure, a  new route through Nepal can join BRI all the way to Gujarat and Kolkata  Port. This would make most sense as they have bullet trains up till that  region. So, the travel time to loop around through Strait of Mallaca  can be reduced by directly getting to DFC in India. Further, most  factories are being setup in India. If India joins BRI, the factories  can persuaded to not actualize any benefit from shifting base to India  and thereby retain status quo for Indian manufacturing sector (V shape  economy).\n\nI think I am concocting something untrue at this point but it cannot  be denied that Chinese need something from India. They are very pro  India at this point and the shift is disconcerting to say the least.'<br />Author: 'snakewranglerextra'  id: 'tph0qd'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tph0qd/what_is_up_with_china_wrt_its_stance_on_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'One of the biggest challenges we face in intimacy is asking for what we actually want.'<br />Body: 'One of the biggest challenges we face in intimacy is asking for what we actually want. Whether that be sex or any form of touch exchange. We would go along with something we weren’t fully into out of fear of upsetting the other person, avoidance of our own pleasure, or just because we simply do not even know what we want ourselves. Even if we were to voice what we wanted, we would feel guilt or hold too much concern for the other person to be able to even enjoy the experience for ourselves. In doing this, who are we even living for? Why are we abandoning our own desires? And what I feel most importantly, what role model are we setting for ourselves and what standard are we setting on how we show up in the world? \n\nIt’s empowering to ask for what you want. To voice your desires in a safe and sacred setting. To have that moment, completely and only for you. When we voice our desires, it empowers us and begins to clear the way for heart/head communication to flow. \n\nThis brings us to the question, what if we don’t know what we want? This question will arise in most people and the answer is simple… \n\nYour body’s innate wisdom already knows the answer, however, we live such fast-paced, distracted and disassociated lives that we have forgotten how to tune-in to the messages that our body is always giving us. We need to get embodied in order to turn up the volume on these whispers!'<br />Author: 'rabbi9'  id: 'tpgj0a'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tpgj0a/one_of_the_biggest_challenges_we_face_in_intimacy/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'An explainer about Indian security forces.'<br />Body: "I see a lot of contusion on Indian subs abut Indian security forces. So here is my but to give a brief overview.\n\nSecurity forces in India Can be briefly categorized into 3 types.\n\nA) Armed Forces\n\nB) CAPFs\n\nC) State Reserve Forces - Reserve battalions of state police, under state government. \n\nA) **Armed forces** are the most recognized branch and consist of Army , Airforce and Navy. They come under MOD, Army Act applies on them, Trained for lethal combat. Usually 2 level on recruitment -  Commissioned officers and Jawans. \n\nB) **CAPF ( Center Armed Police Force )** - Here is the where most people are confused about. Just to clear, CAPF are NOT army. Army Act doesn't apply to them, Their organisation structure is similar to police forces and they are NOT trained to conduct large scale armed operations. Infact the mandate of BSF in times of war is to fall back and provide scout ops to army.  CAPF comes under MHA and at senior level manned by IPS officers. Usually when you see police in army like clothing during riots, they are CAPF. Army is very very rarely called to control crowd. \nThe Various CAPF's in India Are - \n\n1) **BSF** - Guarding Pakistan and Bangladesh Border - BSF has the most similar culture to army as it was initially raised by army officers but later shifted MHA. Usually considered the best performing CAPF. \n\n2) **ITBP** - China Border\n\n3) **SSB** - Nepal , Bhutan Border\n\n4) **CRPF** - Internal Security  - Usually considered the worst performing CAPF. CI ops are actually Mandate of CRPF. But it has failed to curb the naxal ops and CI ops in Kashmir and NE are conducted by Army and AR respectively \n\n5) **CISF** - Industrial Security. - Mostly this is the 1st choice of people who want to work in CAPF and normally the toppers of The CAPF exam choose this branch due to relatively easy work profile compared to other branches. \n\n**Outliers** - \n\n6)  **Assam Rifles** - Although AR, Technically is not Army and its mandate is to gurard indo-burma border, It has huge manpower deputation from army and it walks, talks and barks like army for all practical purpose\n\n7) **Cost Guard** - Again a police force but functions very similar to navy\n\n8) **NSG** - Has 2 main Parts , SAG - Manned by army personnel and trained to conduct special urban ops , SRG - Manned by CAPF personnel and trained to provide VIP Protection\n\n**Problems with CAPF in India** - \nThe performace of CAPF in India has been somewhat average at best. there are multiple reasons for that.\n\n1) Too may levels of entry. While in Armed forces, You have 2 modes of entry - Jawan and Officer. CAPF on the other hand have 4 levels. - Constable , Sub Inspector , AC and finally at the top IPS. This creates too many levels of hierarchy and hinders unit cohesion. \n\n2) IPS Deputation - CAPF has their own officer cadres which are recruited through UPSC but still  the top posts are manned by IPS. IPS Officer come in at very senior level and consider it as their retirement or holiday posting. Also they have zero understanding of the internal working structure of CAPF. Also as a general rule , The Head of CAPF's ( DG ) are IPS Officers . \n\n3) Identity Crises - CAPF for long have been stuck in a weird place between army and police.  Although there have been some steps taken to give them a clear orientation and focus, One example is the nomenclature. CAPF were earlier called Para-military which have now been changed to Armed Police to give these organisations a clear identity. \n\n4) Apart from that there are numerous other issues like Lack of Funding , Political will , Training etc etc."<br />Author: 'Razor2115'  id: 'tpgeci'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tpgeci/an_explainer_about_indian_security_forces/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The story of how my childhood friend Wasim was radicalised by the local maulana and groomed into becoming a land grabber for the Waqf and how they sold off Muslim dargahs and cemeteries illegally to private builders'<br />Body: '  \n\nWasim was a very smart kid, by his teachers’ accounts and according to his friends too. He was one of those students who did not put in too much effort and yet did well in studies and sports. He was well respected on the cricket ground for his captaincy even though he was a decent player himself. His home life was better than mine actually. His father worked hard as a rickshaw driver and his mother stitched women’s clothes. For reasons I will reveal later, I have to mention that his mother did not wear a burqa or a hijab either. And his father did not sport a beard, although he did wear a skull cap on some days. They always invited their neighbours during eid, and used to invite a few families personally, like mine. The kheer used to be delicious. Even my mother who would not step into a restaurant unless there was a pure veg board displayed outside would eat that kheer because Wasim’s mother was that welcoming and trusted by the locality.\n\nAfter a few years it was around 8-9th standard when he just disappeared from school. He just stopped attending. I remember that day well when I met him in the barber shop and he was not in his regular clothes anymore. He was wearing a skull cap now and a pathani style shalwar kameez. I almost did not recognize him. After we had our hair cut, I asked him why he was skipping school and he just smiled and walked away like he never knew me.\n\nIn a small town like mine, if you had to know something about anyone, you just had to ask a mutual friend and they would tell you. A few houses away from mine was a rich Muslim family that were patrons for the local masjid/madrassa. The father goes to the masjid religiously at 5.30 AM every morning. He has three sons and one daughter (who was married off at 14). The youngest of the brothers was my friend and the black sheep of the family, open to talking with others in the society. Hussain was his name. So, I asked him about Wasim and he said that Wasim was asked to attend the madrassa during the summer vacations and that’s when it began.\n\n# How Wasim was radicalized and turned into a criminal by the local maulana –\n\nThe maulana took Wasim under his care and put him in a group that specialized in burglary. The maulana had contacts a few towns away who would keep a track of who lives in which house and how secure their houses were. If the house was somewhat secluded and their residents go out for travel, the contact would then let the maulana know. This group of teenagers would then break into the house and take what they could. \n\nSome houses would be dry and they would strike gold in some. Much of the loot was kept by the Maulana. He did give a good amount of money to Wasim and his friends. \n\nSoon he was doing as Maulana asked of him. He quit school and did only his bidding.\n\nI did not think much of it until during my college years I met Hussain again and I asked about Wasim who I spotted was sporting a full beard now.\n\nHussain said that Wasim no longer committed petty burglaries. He was into land grabbing now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked how could people just grab land and he explained what he could.\n\n1. They are very vigilant about who owns what land where in the village. They hunt for properties in the outskirts. Many irresponsible land owners do not even demarcate their land with a fence and just put up a board saying trespassers will be prosecuted.\n2. Once a land which has been left unattended for a long time finalized, Wasim would direct a group of kids to start playing cricket on it.\n3. If nobody came to object, he would then ask the children to move a roller on the land to make a pitch for cricket. If nobody asked why a roller was being used on a private land, then the next step would be taken.\n4. Most such pieces of lands were under heavy disrepair. Wild grass, weeds, bushes and even trees grow unhindered. So he would bring a JCB to clear this off for making the cricket ground even better. If nobody objected to bringing a JCB, they would move on to the next step.\n5. They would continue playing for a month or two now. Then they would build a net practice area there. After a month of that, they would convert this net practice area into a temporary shed with a roof. If nobody came to object even after this, the plot was grabbed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis plot would be grabbed on the behest of the maulana, who worked for Waqf board members.\n\nThey had enough contacts in the local survey office and municipality that they could get the papers forged and the title donated to the Waqf.\n\n**After Wasim had helped grab around 8 plots, as per Hussain, he was given the honor of becoming the caretaker of one of the pieces of land he had grabbed**. \n\nThis meant that this piece of land now could be sold, illegally to a private buyer, and the majority of such a proceed would be Wasim’s. \n\nIt also helps that India does not have a national law against land grabbing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Such cases of land grabbing and selling is rampant all over the country by legitimate Waqf land caretakers and these dealings are blessed by actual Waqf board members who in turn funded radicalism all over –\n\nThere is no provision for selling of land endowed to Waqf Board. Any such sale is illegal, as per law. But when as a body like Waqf ever obeyed the laws and regulations of the country. \n\nWaqf board members themselves see to the sale of such properties with the property caretaker acting as the proxy. \n\nAll the paperwork is done properly with all the requisite authorities involved.\n\n**All of the money exchanged is 100% black and that means cash**. Nothing is declared. In comparison, a legitimate transaction in a conventional real estate deal is 70-30, where 30% is exchanged as black.\n\n# \n\n# And here lies the actual problem of such a transaction –\n\nIt is not as if the WAQF board members have a monopoly over land grabbing and selling. Many of the real estate mafia indulge in the same modus operandi across the country. \n\nBut here, the WAQF board money is spent on radicalization of their youth and problematic organizations are funded in places like Kashmir.\n\nThis is such a big problem that even the government had to sit up and take notice.\n\n# \n\n# And just like in triple talaq, hijab case, a Hindu government has to involve itself and work towards reform for minorities –\n\nMost Waqf board members are aware of such a scam going on. They, by their own words, condemn such acts and have appealed to the BJP government to deal with it. \n\nBecause apparently the Muslim community does not have the provisions to police their own leaders or reform their practices.\n\nIt was at their behest, that Naqvi finally decided to digitize the ownership of all Waqf related estate around the country.\n\nThis works on two fronts – \n\n1. Once 100% of Waqf estates are under digital records, their number becomes exhaustive. That means you cannot add any more amount of land into the existing declared estates. So this would effectively take care of land grabbing.\n2. Any sale would trigger flags in the system itself, which means sale of any waqf land would be illegal and recorded by the system.\n\nNow the question to be asked, like a broken record player, is why was this system not brought in the past 60 years. Why was land allowed to be grabbed and sold completely in black? \n\nWhy can’t the caretakers of Waqf land regulate themselves? Why does the government have to swoop in and teach them what the rule of law is?\n\nIn my town there was one Muslim cemetery and when I came back after graduation, there was a hotel built over it.\n\nTurns out it was Waqf property and it was sold to a builder. \n\n**Thousands of such Muslim kabaristans and even dargahs are sold by Waqf board members, who have been given the responsibility of taking care of such revered places.**\n\n**But for money, they are sold off and buildings are built over broken dargahs and graves of dead Muslims.

In fact, there is nothing like that.\n\nSpolier Alert.\n\nThis is what Rubbish is all about Man flying Man fighting a CGI tiger bare handed Man single handedly fighting 100 men Baseless, a sensible movie watcher should shun this blasphemy Investing such huge amount in a film like this means we are as a nation living above the poverty line.\n\nIt's way past independence, show something substantial, people are studying films thesedays, and they know that man can't fly.\n\nTotal waste of time, it's like children playing with their dolls, with vivid imagination.\n\nTotal waste of time.\n\nThe same old method (recipe) has been used to make it. Hero's promise (to heroine or father), Hindu-Muslim brother-brother (unity), fight for freedom from the British, save the innocent. After all these things, to add more flavor to it, showing the hero as a superhuman (without telling his powers, at least add one myth that how he has so much power), the twist of South (Tollywood) (turning the whole story up side down), too much VFX (Low quality visual effects) No scene is without VFX and loud sound is used to make it impressive. It has a lot of slow motion, (too much) if slow motion is removed then the Movie run time will be reduced by at least 30 minutes. So if you are going to watch RRR, don't go. This is the same old Tollywood movie which could have been made in 50 crores but these people have made it for 400 crores by investing pointless money.\n\nPlease share your opinions if you have watched this movie."<br />Author: 'maxspartacus'  id: 'tpc4og'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tpc4og/rrr_what_a_utter_crap_movie_it_is/</li>

Bitta Karate's terrorists and gun him doen hiding in the rice drum. The terrorists force his widow to eat blood soaked rice but leave Pushkar Nath, his daughter in law and their two sons alive.\n\nThe night of exodus in 1990 is shown with Pandits shot and abused by terrorists. Pandit families hide in a famous Pandit poet Premi's house. Premi is taken by Bitta along with his Son, killed and hung on a tree.\n\nThe remaining Pandits are ethnically cleansed to Jammu. While remaining in a camp, Pushkar Nath is noticed by Mithun and relocated back to Nadimarg Kashmir with a govt job. They are repeatedly made to feel like outsiders and eventually Pushkar Nath is left alive in pity but his daughter in law is cut apart using a wood saw and Shiva his older Grandson shot dead.\n\nPushkar Nath and Krishna younger grandson migrate to Delhi. Here he sttend university where he meets Professor Menon(Pallavi Joshi) whom introduces him to the idea that the state is the enemy and Kashmiri Muslims the victim. She uses him to win elections by having him as the contendor.\n\nA few days before the elections, Pushkar Nath dies and his last wish is for his ashes to be dispersed in his home. Krishna flies to Kashmir and stays with Brahma(Mithun). They narrate to him the story and tell him the truth. Krishna is never told of the violence in Kashmir and thinks his parents died of a scooter accident.\n\nHe also visits Bitta Karate whose contact is given to him by Professor Menon. Bitta tells him that Indian army killed his family along with other things. He returns back to Brahma's house and finds out about the Kashmir files, files prepared by Brahma of all the stories, clippings and news of Pandit genocide, including Krishna's family. They all disperse Pushkar Naths ashes in his house. \n\nKrishna returns to Delhi and gives an unexpected speech about the story of Kashmir, terrorism and the Pandit genocide.\n\nReview\nBrilliantly told story. The plot above is chronological but the story goes between Kashmir 1990 and Kashmir 2022.\n\nThe fear of Pandits in the valley is told well, locals turn on them, they can't support India and the Government is silent.\n\nMedia is a sell out and refuses to report the truth. Local Police disobey orders,  Pakistani money is in circulation and abuse is a daily event.\n\nAll actors are brilliant but Darshan Kumar's acting isn't perfect.\n\nKashmir is shown brilliantly. Most shots are dark.\n\nAnupam Kher is brilliant. Best performance of his life. He played the role with his heart being a KP himself.\n\nThe violence is shown like it should be. The whole movie shocks you to the core. \n\nPersonal feeling\nI was ok with the violence. I'd heard and read these stories before. My grand parents being Partition survivors, I wasn't shocked that your neighbours will slaughter you or support those slaughtering given the chance.\n\nTwo things got me - 1) The hunger and plight of Hindus in camps. The Kashmiri sad songs play so well in their plight.\n\n The scene of a girl wanting to pee in the truck and how she sees dead Premi and his Son hung on trees.\n\nPushkar Nath leaving the food for his grand kids and leaving the prescription glasses so his grand kids can have schooling.\n\n\n2) Farooq abdullah and Kashmir govt being hand in glove with the terrorists.\n\n\nWhy the left is angry\n\nIt shows Kashmiri Muslims in a bad light - Though its a fact that mosques and Maulvis shouted for Pandits to convert, leave or die.\n\nIt shows VP Singh, Farooq Abdullah, Mufti Sayeed and Sheikh Abdullah in a bad light\n\nIt shows Media in a bad light - No one showed what was happening until it was too late. Barkha Dutts infamous blurb is shown spoken by Pushkars friend\n\nIt shows Left professors, naxals and andolanjeevis as a nexus - State is the enemy, they use this logic to get into power\n\nWhy this film is important\nA new way of making films\n\nKP story needed to be told\n\nThe nexus is what causes violence and riots to happen again and again.

Each of these countries has its own global popularity in the world for its contribution to arts, music, movies, TV, and many others. Japanese anime is the most popular in the world for its stories, characters, art and other things. Funnily enough, Japan embraces this culture all over the country. Wherever you go, it's anime everywhere. Hong Kong action movies and Chinese martial arts movies are also very popular and their stars like Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen are very popular with western audiences. As for South Korea, KPop and K-dramas rule the TV world with people binge-watching every one of them.\n\nThat being said, all these countries are unapologetic about their content and actually promote them prominently in their countries. Now I have gotta ask, why is there a reluctance to embrace our movie and music culture? I've seen people on YouTube going gaga over our movies, songs, our singers, and all. Why are we thinking the song and dance routines in our movies are a bad thing? That it defies logic? I once read here about someone saying that this is our national identity and that we shouldn't shy away from it. I agree with that person completely. For those of you wondering who said that songs are useless, it's a couple of older people I know who have been complaining about the way our movies are made, with more emphasis on dance and songs rather than content.

At the moment I have no evidence of any such loopholes. But as with any startup the odds are high.  Let me reproduce this [comment] (https://np.reddit.com/r/DesiMeta/comments/rmqwil/presenting_kaashiorg_reedit_alternative_for_india/hpp6c4m/) from the desimeta post introducing Kaashi:\n\n&gt;What is your policy for traffic from Tor network?

There was a [recent article] (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/16/israeli-firm-candiru-spyware-linked-to-attacks-on-websites-uk-middle-east) about Qatar's 2nd most famous news website after Al Jazeera, Middle East Eye, getting targeted by hackers to identify their visitors. This can happen to any website, and I am not saying this to discourage any from using and visiting OP's site. All I'm requesting is for redditors / companies with the cybersecurity know-how to extend their help to OP and help make his site even better.\n\nThe creator of Kaashi is u/Tumharabaap786, and I request you all to help him pro bono. In 2020, after TikTok was banned, many Indians patriotically downloaded some of the indigenous alternatives. It later emerged that those apps had huge security flaws which allowed anyone to hack their data. This is a common scenario for many startups and the reason I'm saying this is not to discourage its use. By allowing patriotic Indians to offer pentesting to plug the vulnerabilities, we can make these platforms even better and safe for everyone. \n\n**I also request everyone making an account on these platforms to use a different password.

Voted without any issues.\n\n**State elections 2016** :- no one from my family went to vote. Polling booth was blown away by TMC goons. Goons were roaming on street flaring Guns. Remember the scene where i tried to look through the street corner as to what was happening and my neighbor shouted over me to go inside. Got a good scolding that day.\n\n**LS elections 2019** :- was quite skeptical regarding voting, still decided to go after my interview. BJP fielded a TMC turncoat popular dabang. First time saw such a security at polling booth. Heard about a lot of clashes and booth captures in nearby areas, however i ended up voting without any problem.\n\n**State election 2021** :- got used to bomb noises by this time as area was under BJP control and there used to be regular clashes and bombing from the other party. Popular local BJP leader got shot dead in front of police office by goons. Felt a genuine fear for first time as to what awaits.\n\non election day, while standing in a queue at polling booth(a school) waiting for my chance, heard bomb noise. Everyone started running. Suddenly saw another bomb blast nearby school by some goons. Ran for my life, didn't voted. later heard that some people got arrested regarding bombing.\n\nAfter election, all the people in local club(till then under BJP control) started joining TMC due to fear. Two day later saw a huge celebration rally playing TMC songs passing through our area, with a particular guy getting celebrated by others in the rally. Turns out it was the same guy, who was jailed for bombing.\n\n**Municipal elections 2022** :-Next level vote rigging. Never saw anything like this, that too in complete sight without any fear.

Some Indian literature’. \n\nPeople who are against the Gita in schools are either 1) Pakistani’s larping as Indians, or 2) Confused. \n\nWhen European schools teach the Odyssey and the Iliad in their literature classes, you think people are having an aneurysm as to why it’s not a Bible or Quran or Veda? Ofc not, they understand that the significance of these books are their historical and cultural legacy. The fact that it’s their own literature, the oldest that they have, written by their ancestors, is sufficient for them to learn and be rooted in their own philosophies and history. Do you understand how absolutely comically arrogant and mentally deficient somebody has to be, to say that ‘Since I have now converted to a different religion since 3 generations, we must avoid teaching 97% of Indian history’. Oh piss off, who cares what religion you follow, that’s entirely irrelevant to the fact that the Gita is the oldest text in HUMAN HISTORY, and it is written in INDIA, by our INDIAN ANCESTORS, arguably the GREATEST Indian literature, and contains some of the most culturally relevant themes and philosophies to our country today like tolerance, virtue, duty, casteism. I see absolutely no reason we should learn The Merchant of Venice or Macbeth and not an Indian epic. \n\nHonestly, I’m surprised it’s taken so long. It’s high time our syllabus is more culturally rooted. This issue of people treating their religious identity as their cultural identity is a disease exclusive to India, where Indian Christian’s think they’re brown Europeans, and Indian Muslims think they’re immigrants from Arabia, Turkey, the Gulf, or the Steppe lol.  It’s an absolute joke. It’s time we show some respect to blood, our ancestors and the greatest and oldest civilisation in human history. \n\nJai Hind.'<br />Author: 'salamalyon'  id: 'tkvi8b'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tkvi8b/bhagavad_gita_in_schools_is_excellent/</li>

Reason why I created LucaMail was that I found existing  EMail  Cllients clumsy, not very modern, not modern themeable UI and  difficult  to contribute or extend. I was frustrated with existing  solutions, so i  started working on LucaMail.\n\nAfter   months of work,LucaMail is now ready for use. Just like how VS Code   revolutionized Programming editors, I want LucaMail to be a revolution   in EMail Clients. UI is completely themeable (It uses Tailwind CSS by   default). It supports GMail,Outlook,Yahoo Mail and other EMail providers   which support IMAP and SMTP(almost all). LucaMail has multi-account   support too. It has multi views and settings can be configured via file.\n\nWhat's   More? Lucamail is written in Javascript so it's very easy to  contribute  unlike other email clients.

      <li>Title::: 'In South Asia, a Battle Against Taboos on Female Sexuality'<br />Body: 'Seated at a dinner table a few months ago, I was hardly expecting the conversation to turn to wedding nights and women around me sharing their experiences. After all, sex or any sort of physical intimacy is rarely discussed in South Asian society. As I was the youngest and only unmarried member of the group of women seated on the table at the time, the unsaid expectation was that I would stay silent. But I realized the extent of this silencing about sexuality only when one of the women on the table shared just how little she knew about sex until the day she got married. Even then, on the night of her wedding, when she asked her mother what to expect, she was told, “Just do whatever your husband says.” She was 16 at the time. More than a decade after that conversation took place, she was sitting at a table with me, laughing about the incident. Everyone else laughed too, because women being uneducated about their own bodies and relationships was not only normal but in fact preferred.   \n   \nI’ve replayed that conversation multiple times in my head, trying to figure out why no one saw how scary such a situation could be for a young girl and why the absolute lack of autonomy she had in that moment didn’t worry them more. Finding answers to my questions proved even more difficult because “good girls” aren’t supposed to ask questions about sex or want to know more about it. Yet at the same time, we also have to constantly deal with the fact that while we’re not allowed to understand our own sexuality or sexual health, everyone else continues to view us through that very lens. From shame about menstruation to policing of women’s clothes, South Asian women grow up under a sexualized gaze from a very young age— often with little authority in the matter.   \n   \nAnanya Rao-Middleton, the creative director at Expert by Experience, a community-led organization that looks at mental health in South Asia, told New Lines how these taboos about sexuality force women into boxes of “good” and “bad.” “Both identities are formed around our sexuality, and so our sexuality is policed in order to ensure we conform to the ‘good’ South Asian woman identity and not fall into the ‘bad’ one. It is the policing and enforcement of these identities that create taboos around women’s sexuality. Taboos may include things like ‘you mustn’t have sex before marriage,’ ‘you mustn’t gain weight/get fat’ and ‘you mustn’t wear revealing clothes,’ ” she said.   \n   \nThis suppression of any conversation about sexuality is reinforced by the way South Asian culture is developed, particularly in its relation to gender roles and stereotypes. When everything from TV shows and movies to family expectations and social norms is telling a woman that her body isn’t her own, just how far can she go to change her own understanding of herself?   \n   \nCreative entrepreneur Am Golhar, whose work focuses on advocating for diversity, remembers discussing the backlash to the Netflix show “Bombay Begums” because it openly discussed the realities of sex work, menopause and exploring sexuality in India. And, yes, many cultural observers argue that media representation of gender and sexuality is at least forcing a much-needed conversation, perhaps an easier one to have since we can pretend that we have nothing to do with the characters on the screen. But it is far from enough to depict a woman having sex on TV, because the stigmas around sexuality stretch far beyond the act of sex and sexual pleasure in and of themselves. Indeed, in South Asia, women’s sexuality becomes an inherent part of their identity — one that interlinks heavily with economic crises, climate disasters and everyday parts of their lives. The structures that dictate where women’s sexuality becomes enough of a threat for her to be married off at 15 or for the community to prevent her from accessing healthcare need to be understood beyond the act of engaging in sex itself if these stigmas are to be truly countered. I’ve also seen South Asian women experience a lot of negligence from the rest of the community when it comes to support and guidance on mental and sexual health. Many South Asian women do not feel able to discuss their mental health with their families and community because their issues are not taken seriously. Obviously, this is not something that is just an issue in South Asian communities. We live in a patriarchal world where women are constantly being dismissed and gaslit because we are assumed to be “hysterical,” “exaggerating” or simply just “not telling the truth,” said Rao-Middleton. In many rural areas in South Asian countries, health services are few and far between and women are rarely allowed to travel far to access healthcare if there isn’t a facility close by. When it comes to sexual and reproductive health in particular, gynecologist visits are limited to pregnancy because they’re not really seen as being needed otherwise.   \n   \n“We tend to see our sexual health as women as something that is separate from how we were created and from being a part of ourselves,” said Sameera Qureshi, sexual health educator and Founder of Sexual Health For Muslims. Qureshi, who has worked in the field of sexual health for the last twelve years also points out how much of the work being done in terms of challenging stigmas is often limited because of the way in which we are made to understand what sexuality and sexual health is meant to be. “With the media and South Asian women, there’s a lot of misrepresentation of women’s bodies and self worth. Women are either overly sexualised or seen as being asexual and not having sexual health and sexuality,” she shares, adding that cultural and religious spaces use these barriers of beliefs and norms to limit understandings of women’s sexuality to marriage when infact sexual health is something that is an intrinsic part of ourselves.   \n   \nAdvocates of sex-positivity and sex education can also sometimes lay the entire blame on culture or religious communities, but questions then arise as to who makes up those cultural and religious spaces. Qureshi adds that there is an urgent need to understand the colonial impact of the understanding around sexuality that we see in South Asia today. She further points out how after years of work in the field of sexual health, she decided to start her organization because she felt a need to start a space that situated conversations and education around sex and sexuality within cultural and religious contexts rather than imposing them the other way around.   \n   \nFor Reetika Subramanian, it was only when she started working in some of India’s most poverty ridden, and often crisis-stricken areas that she realized just how much these economic, social and environmental pressures really add to these issues. As the Founder of Climate Brides, Subramanian’s organization explores the linkages between early marriages in South Asia and the climate crisis. Her findings report an alarmingly high rate of hysterectomies in women as young twenty-five, in the Indian region of Marathmara, which is drought-stricken and sees communities finding work in agricultural sectors which can often end up being up to 20 hours of labor a day. With informal settlements being created around agricultural work, women and girls find themselves with little security and at high risk of sexual violence. Subramanian shares with me that early marriages as young as 15 or 16 could be because parents see it as a solution to no longer being responsible for their daughter’s sexuality, and because lack of sex education otherwise leads many in South Asia to believe that once a girl gets her period, she is ready for marriage. Young girls in Pakistan often grow up being told they can do certain things after marriage and daughters in South Asia are often referred to as guests in their parents’ house until their marriage, waiting to be given away to their husbands at the right time.   \n   \nBut the hush-hush nature of sexual and reproductive health issues along with with early marriages often leads to a high number of unwanted pregnancies and in the areas where Subramanian works adds further physical strain to the bodies of women who are already enduring up to 12 hours of back breaking manual labor. “By the time many of these women are barely 25 or 26, they’ve already undergone multiple pregnancies and deliveries and coupled with the toll of the labor, end up dealing with side effects to their menstrual cycle, painful discharge or other issues that lead them to get hysterectomies,” Subramanian says.   \n   \nThe shockingly high rate of hysterectomies is far from the only health crisis that women have to face as a result of these stigmas about their bodies. Ignorance of their own bodies is normalized for women, and a lack of access to healthcare makes the situation only worse. “A single south Asian woman seeing a healthcare professional will be questioned, because gynecologist visits are limited to married women. Even healthcare professionals in South Asian often come with their own biases,” Qureshi says. One young girl told her that when she visited a gynecologist with the possibility of a vaginal infection, she was told that she couldn’t have one because she wasn’t married; her concern was brushed off. Healthcare professionals regularly refuse to take unmarried women seriously, often judge mothers who choose to have abortions and may advise against birth control because of personal biases.  The difficulty in finding a healthcare provider who is willing to carry out the procedure puts many women at risk as they end up going to smaller illegal clinics that fail to provide a safe level of care.   \n   \nShe also talks about how difficult it is for sexual health issues to be diagnosed. Issues like PMDD (Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder), a condition that often causes intense pain or other severe side effects during periods; PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), which can also affect menstrual cycles and/or fertility; or vaginismus, in which reflex cramping or intense pain in the vagina makes penetration almost impossible, commonly affect many women but are rarely talked about. “Most women are diagnosed with these [PMDD, PCOS and vaginismus] or other similar issues much later on in life. Without having knowledge or language to discuss these topics, I find a lot of women don’t know how to talk about their bodies, and if we don’t have language it only adds to shame,” says Qureshi. The ignorance, she says, comes from general lack of access to reproductive healthcare, which is starkly differentiated from general healthcare.   \n   \nNot only does that shame limit access to physical reproductive healthcare for women, it also creates generations’ worth of trauma and mental health stigmas around sexuality for women in the region, and severely affects mental health as well. “Many South Asian women, for instance, suffer from depression and anxiety due to low self-esteem and negative feelings about our bodies. I believe that this is because we are brought up to look at our bodies through the lens of control and with a distinct sense that our bodies are not our own,” Rao-Middleton says. Like Rao-Middleton and her work with Expert by Experience, many women’s rights activists have decided that it’s time for an unsilencing around South Asian women’s sexuality — and one of the first places that needs to come from is family.   \n  \n“Our families play a huge role in ensuring that we are ‘good’ South Asian women, and for this reason they are central to narratives we hear about our bodies. I think the main narrative told to South Asian women that I hear again and again surrounds the idea of shame. We should feel ashamed for having a body that is ‘too much’ — too curvy, too fat, too ‘provocative.’ Particularly from puberty, we are told that our bodies are the place where our family is either shamed or honored,” says Rao-Middleton.  \n  \nHer sentiments are echoed by Paromita Vohra, the founder of Agents of Ishq, a digital project focused on giving sex “a good name.” Vohra tells me that an understanding of how South Asian culture is different from Western communities plays a key role in developing the right kind of help and care. “It’s a reality here that people are highly dependent on family and cannot cut those deep emotional ties and we cannot stigmatize them. We need to develop ways of care rooted in our context,” Vohra says.  \n  \nThe lack of local and relatable narratives is also the driving force behind creating Agents of Ishq, and the platform features stories by different people that give a glimpse into the reality of what a range of sexual experiences can be like. To a large extent, projects like Agents of Ishq are focusing on decolonizing generations’ worth of sexual stigmas that have boxed up sex into this specific definition that seeks to shame and harm women. “Agents of Ishq has reflective narratives. It’s not about heroes and victims, it’s that kind of reflective sharing of your narrative in a space that won’t use your narrative for some other purpose and its is important because readers realize they’re not alone in what they’re going through,” Vohrs says, presenting this example of building empathetic communities as one possible solution to moving past a culture of taboo and stigma.  \n  \nBut solutions cannot be one-sided, and social, individual and even political actions need to come together to create lasting change. While so much emphasis is often placed on community and structural action, Subramanian says that often the people we fault — older generations who impose these norms — may not be entirely the ones to blame. “Primary healthcare centers can initiate these conversations, engaging them more productively and in a more emotional manner [and] involving the family in some of these conversations and decisions,” she says. But, she says, families often feel their hands are tied despite wanting to do better because of a lack of access to finances or education regarding the issue. She adds that “engaging different stakeholders becomes key.”  \n  \nChange is about moving beyond the binary choice of either wrapping up sex in complete silence or promoting hypersexuality. It’s about agency and allowing women to own their space and their bodies, both on their own and within their relationships. It’s about an unsilencing that is loud and radical. It’s time that more space is given to the voices doing just that.  \n   \nhttps://newlinesmag.com/argument/in-south-asia-a-battle-against-taboos-on-female-sexuality/'<br />Author: 'snooshoe'  id: 'tkfk5d'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tkfk5d/in_south_asia_a_battle_against_taboos_on_female/</li>

And it’s supposed to! \n\n&gt;&gt;People do circumcision for this, but that’s not required if you can pull it back. It might be painful for someone to pull it back in the early stages but after a couple of tries, you’ll be able to. \n\n&gt;&gt;This is really important, you need to be able to pull the foreskin back, so you can clean it properly and also because if you don’t, as you grow, your foreskin will get stuck and tighten up. And after a certain teen age you might not be able to pull it back and it’ll cause you a great amount of pain when you try to do so. \n\n&gt;&gt;This will cause you issues when jerking off, when having sex and also lead to health issues since you won’t be able to clean your part properly. \n\n**This is something most Indian parents will not know or not prefer to talk about with their kids hence I’m trying to!**\n\n**If you find this helpful, please upvote or comment for reach so even other teenagers can read**\n\n[Reference](https://static.tuasaude.com/media/article/gz/rr/phimosis-treatments_1469_l.jpg)'<br />Author: 'Cancer_ian'  id: 'tk856y'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk856y/very_important_phimosis_specially_for_boys/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Aam Aadmi Party Can Shake Up Gujarat Politics. Heres how.'<br />Body: "The aim is to sweep the Gujarat state election.  Gujarat is a state where BJP has dominated the state and central elections.  If the AAP wants to sweep the polls decisively, they cannot do conventional politics.  They have to adopt a high risk-high reward strategy.\n\nGujarat is a relatively progressive and comparatively rich state.  Most people from Gujarat prefer the entrepreneurial/professional route to success rather than the government job route, in other words the people are aspirational.  The Gujaratis have been trading and travelling globally since the Harrapan civilisation era.  The Lothal port had regular ships coming in from Africa 3000-4000 years back.\n\nUse Induben Khakharawala as a metric, and check which countries they get orders from.  There are 100s if not 1000s of Induben Khakhrawala type businesses in Gujarat.\n\nGujarat is ready for the next wave of growth.  The Congress party delivered the first wave with the GIDC estates.  The BJP delivered the second wave with the infrastructure.  The problem is that Congress has lost the faith of the people.  BJP in the state is clearly a proxy and Modi/Shah are still very much in control of all the decisions.  AAP has some credibility now.  All they need to do to sweep the polls is promise the third wave of progress which will put Gujarat and Gujaratis at par with Singapore in terms of wealth.\n\nIt comes down to few things.\n\nFirst prohibition.  People are talking about scrapping prohibition, but prohibition is seen as a very big reason for the relatively low crime rate in Gujarat.  So anyone who promises scrapping of prohibition is going to lose.  But there is a way out.  The way out is to add a new class of permit.  Currently the only legal way to buy and consume alcohol in Gujarat is by getting a permit.  There are two main classes of permit.  One is issued to out of state/out of country people.  This is relatively easy and cheap to get.  For the residents of the state, there is the health permit.  It has many criteria, like you have to be above 40, you have to be paying income tax for past 3 years, you need the chief doctor of the civil hospital to say that you need to consume alcohol on health grounds.  After all this, the official cost is 25000 rupees and unless you are willing to roll the dice and spend time with the bureaucracy, you have to pay another 25000 to an 'agent' who will handle the graft for you.  After all this you get a permit valid for 1 year that entitles you to 1 or 2 units per month.  The number of units increase over time, but the whole process is repeated, including the doctor certificate.  The price goes down but it is not significant.\n\nSo what AAP needs to propose is to create a new class of permit which anyone over 21 is eligible, valid for a year, 2 maybe 4 units per month and costing say 5000 flat.  Additional documentation like address proof, age proof, photograph etc are still required, but the process would be straightforward.  You renew this every year for 5000 more rupees.  There are still no bars, you still need to sit in your house and drink.  You still cannot go out drunk.  You still cannot drink and drive.  You still cannot share your liquor.  Consider that 5000 is what people spend on a lunch.   Compare this with the permit you need to get in Mumbai.  It costs maybe 500 rupees and is valid for 20 years and entitles you to 8 units every week.  It is safe to estimate that about half of gujaratis drink.  That is 2 crore people.  All of them can afford to pay 5000 per year for a permit.  Trust me on that.  Right off the bat you have 10,000 crores assured annual income.  This excludes the GST/VAT on the liquor.  This money can be spent on so many welfare programs.  And what about the bootleggers and the delivery people.  They will be made official.  The bootleggers and the delivery people who join the AAP and campaign for them will get permits to open wine shops and do home delivery of liquor.  Their livelihood remains intact, they become legal and they dont have to pay off the police and politicians any more.\n\nSecond is reservation.  Most people eligible for reservations have still not got any benefit of it.  Despite 60 years of the police.  You can see entire villages filled with eligible communities who haven't seen an admission or a job so far.  So with the money from the prohibition, education can still be free to poor people (not on basis of caste but on basis of wealth).  People who need money to start a business will get it on easy terms.  Again, full background check and money has to be paid back and people have to have skills.  They can go a step further and fund an entire village where they are making something unique.  Like Yogis project of one district/one product, AAP can say to a village like Ganeshpura with the famous Ganesh temple, your chips will be branded, your will get a geotag, your chips will be sold worldwide, we will fund your cooperative, all of you will have predictable revenue and will prosper.  Of course you have to return the money and pay taxes.  You go to any part of gujarat, there is something unique.  It could be a pickle, a garment, a food product... even uniquely dried garlic!  All of these people can be told the same thing.  Bottom line, the AAP can say that whatever central government quotas are there, they will remain, but the state government reservation quotas will go down to 0.  The patidars and kolis and others who are agitating for getting included in reservation quotas want exactly this.  They are not after jobs, but they are after getting admissions in college courses.  They want to get qualifications.  This is an aspirational play. They will support scrapping of reservations.  No doubt about this.\n\nThird point is about cleanliness and following the law.  Gujaratis have travelled around the world and/or have heard stories from around the world.  The main point of every tale from anyone who comes back from a foreign tour is about how clean it is and how strict they are with their laws.  AAP should say that people from other parts of India who visit Gujarat will go back and relate the same stories.  The cleanliness and the traffic sense and the social order was such that you would not believe that you were in India.  \n\nThe worst thing about gujarat elections is the voter turnout.  If you look at the voter turnout, it is anywhere from 40% to 70%.  The people who don't show up to vote are far more than the margin of victory.  They are enough to swing the elections.  By changing the narrative if the AAP is able to get those people to show up to vote, they can win easily without having to focus on weaning away the BJP voters.\n\nI hope that AAP people see this and do their own critical thinking.  In the end, the AAP people can decide to take a high risk gamble.  They may lose badly, but I have a strong feeling that they will win big.\n\nJai Hind."<br />Author: 'cantstartup'  id: 'tk673r'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk673r/aam_aadmi_party_can_shake_up_gujarat_politics/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Where to go to pursue Filmmaking, Canada or UK? I've already got offered a seat in a film and video production program in Canada but am still unable to choose between Canada and UK."<br />Body: "Hello everyone,  \nAs mentioned in the title, the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (Calgary, Alberta) has offered me a seat in their two-year film and video production diploma program for fall intake. Total tuition fees for the same is approx. 24L plus 6L for living expenses (of 1 year). I am able to get a loan of Rs. 20L which will be applied against tuition fees and living expenses and by doing so I'll be falling short of tuition for the last sem and hence I'll do part-time work for the whole duration to gather the last sem's tuition fee. Currently, I just have to make a tuition deposit of 1L until the 15th of April then I can apply for the student visa. Not to mention, PR is also what I'm eyeing, and after studying for 2 years in Canada I will get a post-graduation work permit for 3 years which will make it a total duration of 5 years, and hence after that, I would be able to apply for PR.\n\nNow the thing is I'm also tempted to go to UK for plenty of reasons such as the presence of the world's best-renowned universities and the exposure they can provide me to break into the film industry. Also UK's new policies for immigrants who want to do master's according to which they can get 2 years work permit after completing their master's. However, the problem here could be the cost as I'm not much aware of the expenses involved and honestly I can't trust any agent or agency because it seems like they just want to send students to the UK to fetch more commission money. In my case, I can't go beyond 24-25L due to weak financial conditions. And the UK seems way more expensive but a lot of people have been saying that it would be somewhat of the same for me.\n\nMy queries according to the challenges I'm facing are as follows:\n\n1. Should I consider the UK as an option for a Master's as a master's degree would be better than a diploma degree?\n2. The new policies of work permit and all in the UK are so new that I don't know anyone who got a work permit by going thereafter the implementation of these policies and hence I don't know whether to get a post-graduate work permit is that easy or not bcs if I couldn't have one then I won't be able to repay my loan.\n3. Doing part-time work in the UK during my master's would be easy or manageable?\n4. If I'm able to get a work permit for 2 years in the UK, then what will happen after that? Some agents told me that I can apply for an extension but I don't believe that's the whole truth.\n5. How can one get a PR in the UK after completing their master's degree from there?\n6. What should I do as I'm very tight on budget and can't take further risks except taking a loan of 20L and becoming a sole bearer?\n\nIf you've read until here, then please provide me some kind of advice or help if you can as having someone else's perspective can really help me in making an informed decision.\n\nmy\\_qualifications:\n\n1. 12th (commerce): 75%\n2. Bachelor of Arts (Management): 58%\n3. Working professionally for 2 years, co-founder of a digital marketing firm based out of central India. I also have a portfolio to show my filmmaking and video production skills.\n\nI might have missed something, please ask me if you need any other info with respect to the matter."<br />Author: 'abhinowww'  id: 'tk34h1'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tk34h1/where_to_go_to_pursue_filmmaking_canada_or_uk_ive/</li>

So today its not only the islamists that they side with, but a  lot of minorities because of their indocrination of post modernism. As  Jordan Petrson says, these so called post modern neo marxists are  different than the earlier definition of the traditional leftism.

Following this request he went to visit the Prime Minister of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Ram Chandra Kak and Maharaja Hari Singh to better understand their views on the State of Jammu and Kashmir joining Pakistan, as Jammu and Kashmir was a Muslim majority state. In 1947 it was clear that an alternative plan was needed to bring Kashmir under Pakistan's control. Rahman tried his best to organise all of the ex-army people to wrest control of Jammu and Kashmir. Rahman led many battles against the Dogra forces, particularly in Bhimber and Kotli. Under the leadership of Rahman the Muslims of Bhimber rose against the Dogra rulers and separated Bhimber from the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.\n\nA GHQ Azad (General Headquarters of Azad Kashmir) was formed in Gujrat, Pakistan, with General Zaman Kiani as the commander-in-chief and Habib ur Rahman as the chief of staff.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habib_ur_Rahman_(Indian_National_Army_officer)#First_Kashmir_War\n\nFate of Hindus in Bhimber &amp; Kotli:\n\nAs per the census in 1941 (as in other census documents), it was reported that the presence of both the Hindus and the Sikhs in PoJK has been found since the earliest times. The Brahmins constituted over 14, 000 in Bhimber district p. 12, [8] There were over 8, 000 Hindu Rajputs and over 16, 000 Jats in Bhimber district p. 12, [8].\n\nThis means Bhimber housed at least 34,000 Hindus at the time of attack of Pakistani forces led by Habibur Rehman. As per Balraj Madhok, the numbers of Hindus &amp; Sikhs at the time of partition swelled even higher in Bimbher as Hindus,Sikhs from far flung areas of Pakistan reached Bhimber which was under Hari Singh's rule.\n\nShabir Chaudhary, a former JKLF leader, recounts his own memories. He states, “I have many horror stories from Mirpur and Bhimber where Muslims butchered non Muslims, and many were burnt alive; and this tragic incident happened about two miles away from my village in District Bhimber. Frightened non Muslims from various villages took shelter in a big Kothi (house) of an influential Hindu in a village called Naka Gura, about four miles towards north from Jatlan. Exact number is not known, but I was told that there must have been more than 100 people, which included men, women and children. All of them were deliberately burnt alive, not because they posed any threat to the majority population –Muslims or committed any crime against Islam, but because they were non Muslims.\n\nBalraj Madhok, who was a leader of the Praja Parishad, in Jammu. He writes the following lines about Bhimber, a town in the current PoJK, “some refugees from Pakistan and Hindus from surrounding villages, lies just two miles within the State border. It was a tehsil headquarter within the Mirpur district. It fell to the armed Pakistani raiders who began shelling the town with heavy guns. Just at this time, the Indian Dakotas were carrying the first consignment of airborne troops to Srinagar. The people of the town who had assembled in the courtyard of the fort-like tehsil building found all their roads of escape blocked. Still some of them rushed out with the few State troops. But most of them could not. Finding that no hope was left, hundreds of Hindu ladies took poison which they had taken with them as a precaution and thus revived the practice of ’Jauhar’. Many others were kidnapped along with their children. The male population was put to the sword.” p. 49, [11].\n\nhttps://sringeribelur.wordpress.com/the-partition-riots-and-attendant-demographic-changes-in-the-state-of-jammu-and-kashmir/"<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'tjyf8r'<br />Score:71<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tjyf8r/habibur_rehmanclosest_aide_of_netaji_subhash/</li>

I will go first; This must be from - 11 years ago. We were travelling to Kedarnath and Badrinath, but on the way, our Car broke down. And it was pouring heavily and almost night. We were young, and our parents were frantically looking for a place to stay and also get the car mended. We were nowhere near any town/city and walked 6-7 kms to reach the nearest one. \n\nI remember the tiny hamlet had no more than 10 lights on, on the few properties that were situated there. It was that small; just a grocery store and 4-5 homes. It was pouring heavily, so we tried enquiring for places to stay and one of the houses told, they will host us. I don’t remember much about them, but they were primarily land owners/farmers, had their sons studying in cities, the aunty was very sweet and they had a huge house. It rained all night and next morning; but I remember the whole scenery looked like something just out of Ruskin Bond’s book. Next day I opened the balcony and I swear, never in my life,I had seen, such a beautiful scenery as that day and place. A little clear stream was flowing outside in the gorge; there were colourful flowers and plants everywhere, birds were chirping; and there was a misty atmosphere, little clouds here and there - I am no writer, but I can’t describe any better than - it looked like something out of the book. They gave us fresh food and fruits; straight out of farms, cooked and served. I remember being very thankful to the host family; and they also helped us in getting our Car mended. The aunty told us about wild animal sightings in and around their area; about their “town history” and how they use ayurvedic herbs to treat themselves and etc etc. She took us on a walk in their farms, explained what things they grow and etc etc. By afternoon, we packed up, said our thanks and goodbyes and left for the next destination. \n\nThis place wasn’t named anything on google maps; but I remember the nearest town to it was Nandprayag. This place is still engraved in my memories, even after so many years; even though I have visited tons of places in Uttarakhand, Himachal and other hilly areas; but this place felt special on a whole different level (Probably because of kindness those random strangers showed us). I wish I can remember it’s name and pay a visit again.

The number of Hindus and Sikhs brutally killed in  Mirpur, Bhimber, Kotli, all mainland Jammu and now POJK, was way higher  than the Hindus killed in the Valley in nineties. There are many  parallels between the events surrounding the exodus of the Kashmiri  Pandits and the Hindu massacres of Hindus in POJK.\n\nBefore the Jagti KP Refugee camp, there were settlements like Bakshi Nagar in Jammu for the refugees from POJK.\n\nMirpuris cries of help were met with indifference and callousness.\n\nBy   21st October 1947 Pakistan had attacked the districts of Poonch,  Mirpur,  Baramulla and Muzaffarabad . The Mirpuri delegation had already  met with sheikh Abdullah who showed  no interest in sending the Army to  Mirpur, his priority being Kashmir.  This was despite the news of  massacres, mass rapes and abduction of  Hindu and Sikh women pouring in  from Mirpur and its adjoining areas. On  13th November 1947, a  delegation comprising of former chief minister of  the state Mehar Chand  Mahajan and Ram Lal Choudhury went to Delhi to  meet Pt Nehru. Pt Nehru  refused to meet the delegation and agreed to  meet only Mehar Chand  Mahajan whom he had already met many times before.  Nehru refused to  send help to Mirpur despite being told that one lakh  Hindus and Sikhs  were stuck there and would be massacred. Bal K Gupta in  his book  Forgotten Atrocities of Mirpur mentions that Nehru went on to  say that  many Hindus and Sikhs have migrated from Pakistan to India and  the  Mirpuris should also do the same. Mahajan in frustration said that   should he meet the Pakistani PM since Nehru was not interested in saving   the Mirpuris.  **Upon hearing  this Nehru lost his temper and asked the Mirpuri delegation to leave.  The same day the delegation also met Sardar Patel who expressed his  helplessness adding that Jammu Kashmir was a matter that Nehru was  looking after. He advised the Delegation to meet Gandhiji and then Nehru  again on 15th November when he came to Jammu.**\n\n**When  the delegation met Gandhiji he told them that the Army could not go to  Mirpur because there was snow on al the roads leading to Mirpur. He  repeated this despite being told by the delegation that it does not snow  in Mirpur. The delegation came back from Delhi having secured no help  for Mirpur. On 15th November they tried to meet Nehru again at Jammu  airport but Nehru refused to meet them and went onto to Srinagar to  monitor the situation in Kashmir**\n\nOn 25th November Mirpur fell.Atrocities on the Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan-occupied-Jammu and Kashmir :\n\nThe  atrocities on the Hindus and Sikhs of PoJK began immediately after  independence in 1947. The massive atrocities perpetrated on the Hindus  and Sikhs, both by the invading Pakistani troops and their tribal  allies, and the local Muslims who turned on the Hindus, have been  recorded by multiple sources, including first hand accounts produced by  survivors like Bal Gupta , Tarlokchand Dangaryal, and Krishna Mehta, who  have left behind accounts of the terrible massacres they themselves  witnessed at close quarters.  Without any claim of completeness in  covering the atrocities perpetrated on the Hindus and Sikhs of Jammu and  Kashmir, we shall cite a few accounts produced by the eye-witnesses and  other material provided by those with access to primary sources,  especially when the give an idea of the magnitude of the horrors  perpetrated by the invading Pakistanis and their local allies.\n\nThe **erstwhile Maharaja, Dr. Karan Singh, in his autobiography recounts the horrors** caused by the skirmishes caused before the actual invasion:\n\np. 54, \\[6\\] “*Intelligence  reports from the frontier areas of Poonch and Mirpur as well as the  Sialkot sector started coming in which spoke of large scale massacre,  loot and rape of our villagers by aggressive hordes from across the  borders. I recall the grim atmosphere that began to engulf us as it  gradually became clear that we were losing control of the outer areas.  My father occasionally handed some of these reports to me and asked me  to explain them in Dogri to my mother, and I still recall the  embarrassment in dealing with the word ‘rape’ for which I could find no  acceptable equivalent*.” • Reinforcing the magnitude of the  massacres perpetrated by the invading Pakistanis and their local Muslim  allies, Jagmohan points out that when Baramulla fell to the invaders.\n\nthe **horrors were recounted by the New York Times correspondent**, who wrote, “*Surviving  residents estimate that 3,000 of their fellow townsmen, including four  Europeans and a retired British officer and his pregnant wife, were  slain*.” p. 87, \\[7\\].\n\n**Shabir Chaudhary, a former JKLF leader, recounts his own memories**. He states:\n\n“*I  have many horror stories from Mirpur and Bhimber where Muslims  butchered non Muslims, and many were burnt alive; and this tragic  incident happened about two miles away from my village in District  Bhimber. Frightened non Muslims from various villages took shelter in a  big Kothi (house) of an influential Hindu in a village called Naka Gura,  about four miles towards north from Jatlan. Exact number is not known,  but I was told that there must have been more than 100 people, which  included men, women and children. All of them were deliberately burnt  alive, not because they posed any threat to the majority population  –Muslims or committed any crime against Islam, but because they were non  Muslims.*” Loc. 1913-1918, \\[2\\]\n\nWe recount the **memoirs of Bal Gupta, a man who survived the fall of Mirpur**  to narrate the tale. When most of the Hindu and Sikh civilian  population of Mirpur was taken prisoner by the Pakistanis and their  tribal and local allies, they were marched off to Thathal village. It is  here that Bal Gupta narrates the following incident:\n\n“*When  we reached Thathal, there was a change of guard and new Pakistani  soldiers and local Muslims took over command … The Pakistani commanders  announced that soon, they would kill all the male Sikhs since Sikhs had  opposed the creation of Pakistan and thus were Pakistan’s number one  enemy … Upon hearing the the mass death sentence ordered for all Sikh  males, the Sikh women and children started crying and begged for mercy  from the Pakistani soldiers and local Muslims. Nevertheless, the  bloodthirsty Pakistanis did not care about their pleas. They started  pulling small groups of Sikh men to the fields and shot them dead. A few  Sikhs had earlier gone to the nearby village to buy food and were  returning with food for their families when the Pakistani soldiers  stopped them, robbed them of their cash, and asked them to move towards  an empty field. The Sikh men begged to be released so that they could  take food to their children. Nevertheless, the Pakistanis hit them with  rifle butts and shot them dead at point blank range. All this happened  so quickly in front of my own eyes – all of their food lay strewn across  their dead bodies. The Pakistanis kept shooting until there was no  movement from the fallen bodies of the Sikhs. … For the rest of the day,  the Pakistanis, Pathans and local Muslims continued killing Sikhs and  abducting Hindu and Sikh women and girls*.” pp. 30-31, \\[4\\].\n\n* Further on, he narrates another experience. “*On  November 28 at midnight, in the village of Thathal, the Pakistani  soldiers woke us up and ordered us to march in the direction of Alibeg,  which was about ten miles away. The Pakistanis had decided to march the  Hindu and Sikh prisoners during the night to avoid detection by IAF  airplanes. The caravan of prisoners walked all night under the  surveillance of the Pakistani sokdiers. In the darkness, many local  armed Muslims sporadically attacked the caravan. They randomly pulled  Hindu and Sikh men, killed them with their swords and axes, and abducted  Hindu and Sikh women. I saw Muslims kill my mother’s uncle, Khem Chand  Bhagotra, because he was trying to save his daughter-in-law from being  kidnapped. I also saw Muslims shoot dead another of my mother’s uncles,  Mukund Lal Sootwala, when he tried to protect his daughter from being  kidnapped*” p. 33, \\[4\\].\n* Bal  Gupta, who has written the horrors of the fall of Mirpur, mentions that  out of the 25, 000 residents of Mirpur (15, 000 residents and 10, 000  refugees), only around 2, 500 people reached India safely p. xviii, \\[4\\].  He has also written the mass executions of the Sikhs and Hindus, and  the massacres of the prisoners in the Alibeg prison, which was really a  Gurudwara converted to a prison p. xviii, \\[4\\]. The number of women  violated and their mass suicides (or them being killed by their men to  avoid them being raped and sold in the markets in Pakistan) has also  been recorded by him, and he puts the number at 5,000 p. xvii\n\n**Harbans Singh, who has recorded the history** of the troubled times in \\[19\\], records that, after the fall of Skardu:\n\n“*There  was panic and chaos all over as the women started committing suicide by  jumping into the Indus and poisoning themselves in order to save their  honour. There was an instance where a girl jumped thrice into the Indus  to kill herself, but each time the waves carried her back to the shore.  The forty non-Muslim refugees were the first to be killed and then began  general murder and rape. Many women in the garrison committed suicide.  All the Sikhs were put to sword and that now infamous message, ‘All  Sikhs killed, all women raped.’ was sent (This was the message sent on  radio by the soldiers who took Skardu to their superiors in the Pakistan  army). Capt. Ganga Singh, commander A Company, 6JAK \\[Jammu and Kashmir  Rifles\\] was tied and shot. The only Sikh who escaped was Kalyan Singh,  Lt. Col. Sher Jang Thapa’s orderly*.” p. 213, \\[19\\].\n\n**Krishna Mehta, who was an eye-witness in Muzaffarabad**,  has recounted how the entire hospital of Muzaffarabad was burnt down,  along with a lot of the patients and doctors inside pp. 10-11, \\[12\\].\n\n**Tarlokchand Dangaryal’s eyewitness account:**  Tarlokchand Dangaryal who was later was rescued from the  infamous  Gurudwara turned into a prison camp — Alibeg, mentions how  local  Muslims, many of whom were deserters from the Maharaja’s Jammu  Kashmir  State Forces would loot the Hindus and Sikhs. He mentions locals  Raja  Murtab Khan and Raja Lal Khan keeping the fleeing Hindus and Sikhs   captive, stealing their gold and valuables and abducting and raping   their women. All males Dangaryal says, 500 of them were taken up a hill,   stripped and hacked before being thrown into the ravine in Kasgumma.\n\nMany  male relatives died trying to protect their wives, daughters and   sisters. Mass suicides including cases of male relatives killing their   women to save them from being kidnapped and sold into the markets of   Pakistan are recorded. Multiple accounts reveal the hatred Pakistani   commanders had for Sikhs because of their opposition to the Partition\n\n**Balraj Madhok in his memoirs:**  describes how hundreds of women of Bhimber  town upon seeing no escape  consumed poison, others were kidnapped and  men butchered. Bhimber saw  one of the worst massacres. For so many  refugees from POJK there was no  closure because they did not have the  bodies of their loved ones to  cremate. He writes the following lines about Bhimber, a town in the  current PoJK:\n\n“*This  town \\[Bhimber\\], with a normal population of three thousand which had  swelled to about five thousand because of some refugees 4from Pakistan  and Hindus from surrounding villages, lies just two miles within the  State border. It was a tehsil headquarter within the Mirpur district. It  fell to the armed Pakistani raiders who began shelling the town with  heavy guns. Just at this time, the Indian Dakotas were carrying the  first consignment of airborne troops to Srinagar. The people of the town  who had assembled in the courtyard of the fort-like tehsil building  found all their roads of escape blocked. Still some of them rushed out  with the few State troops. But most of them could not. Finding that no  hope was left, hundreds of Hindu ladies took poison which they had taken  with them as a precaution and thus revived the practice of ’Jauhar’.  Many others were kidnapped along with their children. The male  population was put to the sword*.” p. 49, \\[11\\].\n\n**Dr Kulvir Gupta:**  lost his father on 3Rd Dec 1947, along with other men  from Alibeg camp  who were stripped, beaten and butchered mercilessly by  the Pakistani  Army before being thrown into the Mangla canal. Bal K  Gupta’s mother  was kidnapped with 100 other women and children on 25th  November 1947  in Mirpur.  The Nuns of a Christian convent in Baramulla were also not  spared. ***The  cries of “Hindu ka zar, Sikh ka sar” (we want Hindus wealth, and the  Sikhs head) rented the air.***  Only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to Jammu along with the State  troops. The remainder were marched to Ali Baig, where a gurdwara was  billed as a refuge camp, but was in fact used a prison. The raiders  killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women.  Only about 5,000 made it to Ali Baig, but they continued to be killed at  a gradual pace by the prison guards. Hindu and Sikh women were raped  and abducted. Many women committed mass suicide by consuming poison  before falling into the hands of the militants, to avoid rape and  abduction. Men also committed suicide. The estimates measure the death  toll at over 20,000.Dr Kulvir himself a survivor from the Alibeg Camp,  says there were no Sikh male survivor in the camp and kesh of young Sikh  boys were wither burnt by their mothers of shorn off by rubbing the  strands between two sharpened stones to hide their Sikh identity. Alibeg  camp has witnessed indescribable horrors — men being taken away to be  killed, women being stripped, starvation, miserable living conditions  leading disease and death. Bal K Gupta’s mother was kidnapped with 100  other women and children on 25th November 1947 in Mirpur, and some of  these women could be rescued by the Red Cross and repatriated to India  only between 1951–1952.\n\nThe  abduction of the women in large numbers, to be raped and sold in markets  in Pakistan has been recounted by Shabir Chaudhary \\[2\\], Balraj Madhok  \\[11\\] and Harbans Singh \\[19\\]. The latter, in particular, gives a very  harrowing account of what the refugees, who numbered in thousands, and  who had escaped from Rawalkot and the rural areas of Poonch went through  \\[19\\]. In fact, even a hardened soldier like Lt. Gen. LP Sen gives a  horrified account of the horrors perpetrated on schools and hospitals in  the Kashmir valley \\[17\\].\n\nAftermath:\n\nMuzaffarabad,  Bhimber and Poonch had significant Hindu and Sikh  minorities. This is  reflected in every census since 1881. In the census  in 1941 (as in  other census documents), it was reported that the  presence of both the  Hindus and the Sikhs in PoJK has been found since  the earliest times.  The Brahmins constituted over 19, 000 in Poonch  Jagir, and over 14, 000  in Bhimber district p. 12, \\[8\\] There were over  8, 000 Hindu Rajputs  and over 16, 000 Jats in Bhimber district p. 12,  \\[8\\].\n\nBefore the [Kashmir War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kashmir_War)\n\nin 1947, the [Mirpur District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirpur_district#History)   had about 75,000 Hindu and Sikhs, amounting to 20 percent of the   population. A great majority of them lived in the principal towns of   Mirpur, [Kotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotli) and [Bhimber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimber). As per census of 1941, there were over 63,000 Hindus in Mirpur &amp; 12,000 Sikhs. **The   total number of Hindus and Sikhs in the regions overrun by the   Pakistanis constituted 84,806 and 33,525 respectively in 1941.**\n\nHowever,  thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Jhelum in  Pakistani Punjab  had flooded the border towns (now in PoJK) in the wake  of the  Partition. Madhok points out that Bhimber had at least 2000  refugees,  Mirpur had at least 15,000 refugees, Rajouri had 5,000 and  Kotli, an  uncounted number. Many of these refugees (along with Hindus  and Sikh  residents) of these towns, with the exception of those in  Kotli,  perished. pp. 50-51, \\[11\\] 46, 836 were settled in Jammu Loc. 959,  \\[3\\]  by the time of the 1961 census.\n\n**Refugees from** [**Jhelum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhelum_District)\n\n**in** [**Pakistani Punjab**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan) **caused   the non-Muslim population in PoJ&amp;K at the time of Kashmir attack  by  Pakistan to swell by at least 25,000 taking the total number of  Hindus  &amp; Sikhs in PoJ&amp;K at the time to be 1.5 lakhs.**\n\n**Of  the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs  escaped to  Jammu along with the State troops. The remainder were marched  to** [**Ali Baig**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Baig)\n\n**, where a** [**gurdwara**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara) **was   billed as a refuge camp, but was in fact used a prison. The raiders   killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women.   Only about 5,000 made it to Ali Baig, but they continued to be killed at   a gradual pace by the prison guards. Hindu and Sikh women were raped   and abducted. Many women committed mass suicide by consuming poison   before falling into the hands of the militants, to avoid rape and   abduction.** Men also committed suicide.\n\n***Recounts Dharam Mitter, resident of Mirpur*** during 1947-48, in his self-published a memoir in 2004 titled\xa0*My Jammu and Kashmir: The Forgotten History-* *“Shrimati   Diwan Devi ji, who was my grand aunt and teacher in the Arya Samaj  High  School had nearly 100 girls with her. Instruction was given to all  that  rolling their scarves like a turban on the head and taking the  name of  God they should jump into the well... afterwards she herself  jumped  (into the well). The well was so deep that even the water was  invisible.  In this way hundreds of other women also saved their modesty  (by  sacrificing their lives).”*\n\nContinues Mitter about Mirpur holocaust: *“Hardly  two thousand  people out of about 25 thousand living at that time in  the ill-fated  town (of Mirpur) managed to reach Jhangar (in India) in  safety. The rest  were ruthlessly butchered. The number of women  abducted from there ran  into thousands. Most of them were paraded and  then sold in the bazaars  of Jhelum, Rawalpindi and Peshawar. The  barbarities of the Pakistan  troops and civilians on these hapless women  who were kept for some time  in Alibeg camp before their dispersal to  different towns put to shame  the worst orgies of rape and violence  associated with the hordes of  Ghengiz Khan and Nadir Shah. The loot  obtained by the Pakistanis from  these towns, especially from Mirpur,  went into crores. The floor of  every house in Mirpur was dug by raiders  in search of hoarded  treasures.”*\n\n**The  massacres and the subsequent exodus which occurred on its mainland and  the Jammu hills have gone under reported. It is evident that it was a  United Jammu (Indian +POJ) which was 61%  Muslims and Indian Jammu 48%  Muslims in 1947.  In the census in 1941 it is clearly observable that  the total number of Hindus and Sikhs in  the regions overrun by the  Pakistanis constituted 84,806 and 33,525  respectively in 1941.**\n\n**Putting  together the numbers of all other witness accounts, we see that roughly  1.5 lakh Hindus and  Sikhs were killed or expelled from the Pakistan  occupied parts of  Kashmir. There are no significant estimates of Hindus  or Sikhs left today in the region and the entire population is assumed  to have either been expelled or killed.**\n\n**In March 1948, the** [**ICRC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICRC)\n\n**rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Ali Baig, who were resettled to** [**Jammu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu) **and   other areas of India. By 1951, only 790 non-Muslims remained in areas   that came to comprise Azad Kashmir; down from a previous population of   114,000 that used to live there**\n\n***but this has been whitewashed from the memories of masses by a subtle propaganda campaign:***\n\n* *A  speech given by Ved Bhasin was reported, but there  the author has not  given any numbers for the number of dead and expelled  Muslims. In a  magazine has claimed that Ved Bhasin had claimed  that 100, 000 fatal  casualties occurred. Nevertheless, there is no  direct quote from Ved  Bhasin, and in any case, Ved Bhasin does not  provide any sources for  his claims either.*\n* *the  author, Karan Thapar, quotes Horace Alexander for a figure of 200,  000  as ‘unaccounted for’. He quotes Christopher Snedden, whose work we   have just examined. Further, he quotes Arjun Appaduri and Arien Mack for   200, 000 killed and 500, 000 expelled, a figure that happens to be   larger than the entire population of Muslims in the Indian part of Jammu   in 1941, and we have just shown, using the 1961 census that the total   number of Muslims in the Indian side was still over 5 lakhs.*'<br />Author: 'DaddieVaibhav'  id: 'tjsyso'<br />Score:378<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tjsyso/the_forgotten_genocide_in_jammu_kashmir_when_more/</li>

Like many other crimes perpetrated against Hindus, this blot on post-independent India has been whitewashed and hidden from public discourse.*\n\n\n*Around 1,100 Hindu girls - all of them from well-to-do influential families - were gangraped over several months. Hindu girls, aged 12-20 ,were specifically raped by Islamic gangs led by Farooq Chishti and then blackmailed for many years.*\n\n\n*The victims included daughters of IAS, IPS, influential government officers and businessmen. They were girls from schools and colleges across Ajmer. 6 victims committed suicide. Several others moved out. Survivors were threatened and most of them did not become judicial witnesses.*\n\n\n*The gang leader was Farooq Chishti, the Khadim of Ajmer Sharif Dargah and then President of Indian Youth Congress Ajmer. Although the police and administration were aware of the gangrape and blackmail of Hindu girls for more than a year, they did not take any action against the criminals due to political pressure.*\n\n\n*The incident was never reported by mainstream media. Despite victims being daughters of IAS &amp; IPS officers, investigation was stalled due to political pressure.*\n\n\n*Entire incident was first reported by Deenbandhu Chaudhry, a journalist working with a local newspaper. Only when the incident was reported with photographs and people in Ajmer hit the roads did the police start registering FIR.*\n\n\n*Deenbandhu Chaudhry was later murdered under 'mysterious conditions' by the conspirators.*\n\n\n*The 1,100 Hindu girls who were raped and blackmailed never got justice. Point of the post is not to open the past wounds or create a divide. It is for people to know their history, their persecutions and be aware of dangers still lurking around. It is easy to label everything as conspiracy or bigotry, but that does not deliver the justice to victims or helps us know our pain.*\n\n\n*Our political establishment, media, historians and intellectuals have not only failed us, but systematically whitewashed and have hidden our past from us to suit their agenda. It is time public discussions on these events happen without any inhibition.

      <li>Title::: 'Varna Depletion'<br />Body: " Varna is a system of classifying social capital, not by birth but individual propensities. The varna categories are still applicable - of intellectual capital, political/governance capital, financial capital and labor. India’s colonizers took away India’s political, intellectual and financial capital,and reduced us to labor serving their interests.\n\nIn other words, we collectively became the shudras while the colonizers became owners of the world of ideas and knowledge, intellectual property, wealth, political clout, and military clout.The colonizers became nexus for the brahmin, kshatriya and vaishya varnas.\n\nEven when the independence in 1947 returned to us our political varna, we didn’t get back our financial and intellectual clout. In the last two decades we have restored some of our vaishya/financial varna as well. But we still lack intellectual Swarajya, and the other varnas are still too dependent on the West.\n\nIf you take a look at the United States, the Rockefellers, Fords and Carnegies exemplified the role played by the super-rich, their vaishya varna, in nation building. They invested heavily in building the American grand narrative. They brought vision and implemented it into a network of libraries, world-class universities, intellectual discourse, national policies, etc.\n\nBut Indian billionaires are rarely committed in a similar way to build India’s grand narrative. They are more concerned about personal wealth accumulation. They live a glamorous jet setting life with one foot outside India and a lot of assets stashed in foreign accounts. If India were to fall apart, they would not be affected as they have nest eggs elsewhere. The bright side is that the rising middle class is far more committed, and this is generating wealth in the broader layers of society.\n\nWhen India has political and financial autonomy, the next step is to develop a robust intellectual class. So far India has failed to bring back control of the discourse about our civilization in the humanities and social sciences. We also need high standards of institutions and mechanisms to disseminate the discourse. This is not an easy or quick battle.\n\n\\- 'Weaving India's MAHAKATHA (Grand Narrative) for the 21st Century ' by Rajiv Malhotra"<br />Author: 'Archer_Arjun'  id: 'tihvwh'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tihvwh/varna_depletion/</li>

Some of the points made stir you up and make you go back and research yourself.\n- Being a centrist, I sometimes used to think that converting LOC to international border is a good solution for both countries. Now, no chance. We should not part with even a inch of that region. "Doodh mangoge toh..." wagairah wagairah :D \n\n\xa0\n\nNeutral:\n- Lot of dramatized scenes and dialogues. Would have preferred a bit toned down movie with reduced background music. But at same time, i understand that cinematic liberties are necessary considering the audience for which movies are made. It\'s not over dramatic though.\n- Expect more such movies from Agnihotri. I don\'t like him much as a director but looks like he\'s one of very few who can make such movies. So, happy with his success. Hope it doesn\'t go to his head.\n\n\xa0\n\nBad:\n- Will propel the ongoing islam hate further\n\n\xa0\n\nTLDR: Its a very well made movie.

      <li>Title::: 'Reason behind introducing GST on pizza topping'<br />Body: 'A ruling by the Haryana Appellate Authority for Advanced Ruling (AAAR) which stated that pizza toppings should attract different GST compared to pizzas. \n\nBut the question is whether to classify the toppings as cheese or as any other classification. Now taking a decision on GST Rate, one has to consider 3 tests as per the GST Act, 2017:\n\n1. Common parlance i.e how a statement is pertained in a layman sense\n\n 2. End use test i.e what is the end use of the product \n\n3. Ingredients test i.e what ingredients are principally used in the preparation So rates could differ on how a product is categorized.\n\nThus AAAR ruled that pizza topping contains vegetable fat as a substantial portion being 22% of the ingredients and hence it does not qualify to be categorized as processed cheese or a type of cheese. Thus pizza topping would merit classification as “food preparation”.'<br />Author: 'DaddieVaibhav'  id: 'thymex'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/thymex/reason_behind_introducing_gst_on_pizza_topping/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How can I gain thicker hair and more hair? My hair is thin and falling out? (Answered)'<br />Body: "Hair fall or thinning hair is a very common problem among both men and women although men are much more affected by hair problems due to their genetics and hormones. I did suffer from a lot of hair fall but I managed to save most of my hair using the methods that I will explain below. \n\nThere are many reasons which could lead to thin hair or hair fall. Now I am going to tell the common reasons hair fall and what natural things a person can do to treat it.\n\n1. Genetic\xa0- This is mainly due to the effects of a hormone called Dihydrotestosterone or DHT which when in excess in the body can result in the miniaturization of the hair follicles on the scalp. How DHT will affect the hair in adulthood is largely determined by genetics and the only FDA approved treatment for this are Finasteride and Minoxidil which work but can have a lot of side effects.\n\nHow to deal with genetic hair loss\n\nThis is certainly the most difficult type of hair fall to treat but still there are a few things that people can try.\n\nRegular scalp massage\xa0- In a study performed on Japanese male participants it was noted that after 24 weeks of regular massaging their hair they had an increase in hair thickness and experienced less hair fall.\n\nNatural DHT blocking hair oils -\xa0Natural DHT blocking hair oils like Pumpkin seed oil and Rosemary oil in scientific studies have been shown to reduce the effects of dihydrotestosterone on the scalp and thus can help with thicker hair growth and less hair fall.\n\nNow you can combine the above two methods for more powerful results. Use DHT blocking hair oils mentioned to massage the scalp regularly.\n\nUse a DHT blocking Shampoo -\xa0Instead of using any regular shampoo switch to a mild DHT blocking shampoo. This will also help in reducing the accumulation of DHT in the hair follicles and lead to strong and healthy hair.\n\n2.\xa0Nutritional -\xa0A lot of people must have heard the term that you are what you eat and it's totally true. Hair loss is very strongly related to poor nutrition. A study performed on Indian participants who had some type of hair loss noticed that nearly every participant in the study has some or the other form of nutritional deficiency. Some of the most common nutritional deficiencies were Iron, zinc, protein, omega-3, copper, etc.\n\nHow to deal with nutritional hair loss\n\nThis is much easier to treat than the genetic hair fall and just if a person pays attention to what they eat on a regular basis can make a huge difference.\n\nNon-vegetarians should go for foods like fish, chicken, eggs and green vegetables to get their daily protein and all the essential nutrients that I mentioned above.\n\nWhereas Vegetarians should include foods like Soyabean, chickpeas, cottage cheese and veggies to get all the required protein and essential nutrients.\n\nVegans should be specially careful as restricted diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies in the body. Vegans should eat tofu, soyabean, lentils for protein and also consider supplementing with a quality multivitamin since some vitamins like B12 are very hard to get from the vegan diet.\n\n3.\xa0Stress\xa0- Stress can not only wreck havoc on the hair but the entire body and the bad thing is not all type of stresses in life are avoidable like a rough break up or death of a loved one etc. But the good thing is stress related hair loss is mostly reverseable and when the stress levels of a person goes down their hair in most cases start regrowing.\n\nHow to deal with hair loss related to stress\n\nPractice relaxation techniques like meditation and regular deep breathing when going through stressful situations. Also workout on a regular basis as it helps in lowering stress levels.\n\n4.\xa0Medication -\xa0Many people have\xa0health\xa0problems for which they use a variety of medicines and some of these medicines can cause hair loss. Certain antibiotics, anti depressants, anti convulsant, weight loss medicines etc. can all cause hair loss. But similarly to the stress induced hair loss this type of hair loss is generally reversable when a person stops using the medicine.\n\nHow to deal with medicine related hair loss\n\nAsk the doctor if an alternative to the medicine is available that is hair friendly.\n\n5.\xa0Unnecessary styling -\xa0Using a lot of chemical products on hair can lead to hair fall and many other scalp problems. Styling the hair on an occasion once in a while is understandable but regularly doing so can cause unnecessary hair problems which are easily avoidable.\n\nHow to deal with styling related hair loss\n\nThis is the easiest type of hair fall to treat just start using less chemical products to style the hair and within a month there will be noticible changes."<br />Author: 'Devanand100'  id: 'thsp3l'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/thsp3l/how_can_i_gain_thicker_hair_and_more_hair_my_hair/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is the actual scriptural basis for the varna/caste system? Why is it even there?'<br />Body: "There is actually no difference of result for any varna in the scriptures. In the varna/caste system everyone gains the same result - नैष्कर्म्य सिद्धि / Naishkarmya Siddhi\n\nWhat is the नैष्कर्म्य सिद्धि ? We all had previous births and our mind has recorded different habits, activities, experiences and sense perceptions. All of these mental imprints are known as samskaras(संस्कार). When all of these samskaras are completely purged then the mind becomes pure and capable of actually achieving God through yog.\n\nWhen samskaras are burnt away by scripturally recommended actions as per one's own nature(swabhaav) then the inclination that we all have towards specific activites, actions also go away. In short, this clear state of mind is known as नैष्कर्म्य सिद्धि\n\nWhether it's a Brahmin, Kshtriya, Vaishya, or Shudra all achieve this same result known as नैष्कर्म्य सिद्धि by performing right actions. This is the actual basis of the caste/varna system. All other purposes are additional, this is primary.\n\nAs scriptural proofs here are relevant verses -\n\n\n7.11.31 प्रायः मनुष्योंके स्वभावके अनुसार धर्मकी व्यवस्था की है\u2060। वही धर्म उनके लिये इस लोक और परलोकमें कल्याणकारी है \u2060।\u2060।\u2060३१\u2060।\u2060। जो स्वाभाविक वृत्तिका आश्रय लेकर अपने स्वधर्मका पालन करता है, वह धीरे-धीरे उन स्वाभाविक कर्मोंसे भी ऊपर उठ जाता है और गुणातीत हो जाता है \u2060।\u2060।\u2060३२\u2060।\u2060।\n\nAs per one's own nature(samskaras) has dharm been arranged for them. If one acts in his profession(swadharma in accordance to scriptures) according to his swabhav(nature) then he gradually gives up these activities, he attains the niṣkāma stage.\n\n\n7.7.28 इसलिये तुमलोगोंको सबसे पहले इन गुणोंके अनुसार होनेवाले कर्मोंका बीज ही नष्ट कर देना चाहिये\u2060। इससे बुद्धि-वृत्तियोंका प्रवाह निवृत्त हो जाता है\u2060। इसीको दूसरे शब्दोंमें योग या परमात्मासे मिलन कहते हैं \u2060।\u2060।\u2060२८\u2060।\u2060।\n\nTherefore, first of all you all should burn away the seeds of guna motivated actions. This will stop the flow/interest of your mind towards different all kinds of actions and then through yog you can attain God.\n\n\n8.1.14 इसीसे ऋषि-मुनि नैष्कर्म्यस्थिति अर्थात् ब्रह्मसे एकत्व प्राप्त करनेके लिये पहले कर्मयोगका अनुष्ठान करते हैं\u2060। प्रायः कर्म करनेवाला पुरुष ही अन्तमें निष्क्रिय होकर कर्मोंसे छुट्टी पा लेता है \u2060।\u2060।\u2060१४\u2060।\u2060।\n\nTherefore, to enable people to reach the stage of activities that are not tinged by fruitive results, great saints first engage people in fruitive activities, for unless one begins by performing activities as recommended in the śāstras, one cannot reach the stage of liberation, or activities that produce no reactions.\n\n\n6.1.53-54 कोई शरीरधारी जीव बिना कर्म किये कभी एक क्षण भी नहीं रह सकता\u2060। प्रत्येक प्राणीके स्वाभाविक गुण बलपूर्वक विवश करके उससे कर्म कराते हैं \u2060।\u2060।\u2060५३\u2060।\u2060।\n\nNot a single living entity can remain unengaged even for a moment. One must act by his natural tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this natural tendency forcibly makes him work in a particular way.\n\n\n11.21.6-7 प्रिय उद्धव! यद्यपि सबके शरीरोंके पंचभूत समान हैं, फिर भी वेदोंने इनके वर्णाश्रम आदि अलग-अलग नाम और रूप इसलिये बना दिये हैं कि ये अपनी वासना-मूलक प्रवृत्तियोंको संकुचित करके—नियन्त्रित करके धर्म, अर्थ, काम, मोक्ष—इन चारों पुरुषार्थोंको सिद्ध कर सकें \u2060।\u2060।\u2060६\u2060।\u2060।\n\nMy dear Uddhava, although all material bodies are composed of the same five elements and are thus equal, the Vedic literatures have installed different varna and ashrams for people of different natures(swabhav/samskar) to effectively check and control their mental inclinations(samskar) and acheive - Dharm, Arth, Kaam and Moksh.\n\n\n10.24.16-17 १०.२४ मनुष्य अपने स्वभाव (पूर्व-संस्कारों) के अधीन है। वह उसीका अनुसरण करता है। यहाँतक कि देवता, असुर, मनुष्य आदिको लिये हुए यह सारा जगत् स्वभावमें ही स्थित है \u2060।\u2060।\u2060१६\u2060।\u2060। जीव अपने कर्मोंके अनुसार उत्तम और अधम शरीरोंको ग्रहण करता और छोड़ता रहता है। अपने कर्मोंके अनुसार ही ‘यह शत्रु है, यह मित्र है, यह उदासीन है’—ऐसा व्यवहार करता है।।\u2060१७\u2060।\u2060। इसलिये पिताजी! मनुष्यको चाहिये कि पूर्व-संस्कारोंके अनुसार अपने वर्ण तथा आश्रमके अनुकूल धर्मोंका पालन करता हुआ कर्मका ही आदर करे।\n\nEvery individual is under the control of his own conditioned nature, and thus he must follow that nature. This entire universe, with all its devtas, asuras and human beings, is based on the conditioned nature of the living entities. Because it is karma(past actions) that causes the conditioned living entity to accept and then give up different high- and low-grade material bodies. And as per the karm-sanskaars he considers other people as enemies, friends or neutrals. Thus people, as per their past samskaras should perform actions in the correct varna and ashram as recommended by the dharmshastras.\n\n\nBG 18.41 हे परंतप! ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय और वैश्यों के तथा शूद्रों के कर्म स्वभाव से उत्पन्न गुणों(सात्त्विक, राजासिक, तामसिक) द्वारा विभक्त किए गए हैं।\n\nOf Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature.\n\n\n7.11.35 जिस पुरुषके वर्णको बतलानेवाला जो लक्षण कहा गया है, वह यदि दूसरे वर्णवालेमें भी मिले तो उसे भी उसी वर्णका समझना चाहिये \u2060।\u2060।\u2060३५\u2060।\u2060।\n\n\nIf one shows the symptoms of being a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya or śūdra, as described, even if they were born in a different varna, then they should be considered of the varna as per those symptoms.\n\n\n18.45 अपने-अपने स्वाभाविक कर्मों में तत्परता से लगा हुआ मनुष्य भगवत्प्राप्ति रूप परमसिद्धि को प्राप्त हो जाता है। अपने स्वाभाविक कर्म में लगा हुआ मनुष्य जिस प्रकार से कर्म करके परमसिद्धि को प्राप्त होता है, उस विधि को तू सुन\n\n\nEach man, devoted to his own duty, attains param siddhi. How he attains param siddhi while being engaged in his own duty, hear now.\n\n\n18.46 जिस परमेश्वर से संपूर्ण प्राणियों की उत्पत्ति हुई है और जिससे यह समस्त जगत्\u200c व्याप्त है, उस परमेश्वर की अपने स्वाभाविक कर्मों द्वारा पूजा करके मनुष्य परमसिद्धि को प्राप्त हो जाता है\n\n\nHe from whom all the beings have evolved and by whom all this is pervaded, worshipping Him through his own swabhavik actions, man attains param siddhi.\n\n\n18.47 अच्छी प्रकार आचरण किए हुए दूसरे के धर्म से गुणरहित भी अपना धर्म श्रेष्ठ है, क्योंकि स्वभाव से नियत किए हुए स्वधर्मरूप कर्म को करता हुआ मनुष्य पाप(मन में अशुभ संस्कार(imprints) का आना ही पाप है) को नहीं प्राप्त होता\n\n\nIt is better to engage in one’s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another’s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one’s nature(swabhaav) do not create paap samskaras (undesirable mental imprints).\n\n\n18.49 सर्वत्र आसक्तिरहित बुद्धिवाला, स्पृहारहित और जीते हुए अंतःकरण वाला पुरुष सांख्ययोग के द्वारा उस परम नैष्कर्म्यसिद्धि को प्राप्त होता है\n\n\nOne who is unattached and without any samskaras(imprints) left in the mind and that who has won over the mind in this way through samkhyayog achieves the highest perfect stage of freedom from all reactions and actions or Naishkarmya Siddhi."<br />Author: 'D_N-D'  id: 'thrbja'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/thrbja/what_is_the_actual_scriptural_basis_for_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Two tips for those who cook regularly : One for Dosa/Idli and another for Roti/Chapati'<br />Body: 'Looks like I\'ve become your neighborhood auntie after continuously cooking for &gt; 1 year. But hey, cooking is divine and the cooking well is divine++. So, I can\'t help sharing the tips, also called as "chitkas" in Telugu.\n\nEveryday there is either a Dosa or Idly, for  breakfast or dinner. And they need to be fermented well to be really tasty. In fact sour dosa,also called as "pulla attu", is a delicacy and is priced a bit higher and there are only few places you can get in and around Tirupathi. So what I do is save a bit of batter (just a drop or two) from today\'s and use it in soaked grains for tomorrow batter. I\'ve been doing this continuously non stop for &gt; 6 months. And I get really excellent quality of batter much better than ID Fresh or MTR. And it will ferment nicely in ~ 6-7 hours.\n\nAlso may be people don\'t realize, Idly/Dosa/Vasa are protein rich and very healthy foods too. If you check Urad dal has quite high protein content. And coconut/peanut chutney also has very high protein content.\n\nAnd next is making good roti/chapati that\'s easy on fingers. Whenever I tried with the methods told by someone, or on YouTube, they come out as biscuits. I figured out a technique though. Mix 10% maida in wholewheat flour (Ashirvad flour). And then use curd to make the dough. Leave the dough for couple of hours ~ 5-6 hours. There will be slight fermentation but the Chapati usually is very soft. Also you can make very large chapati like roomali roti because it will be stretchable. \n\nHope you find these tips useful.

      <li>Title::: 'The origins of Sati Pratha'<br />Body: "Came to know how sati pratha originated in India. It started out among Rajputs where collective suicide was performed by the widows of the royal families who wanted to escape capture and rape by their enemies. This was shown in Padmavat.\n\nThis practice slowly grew into a question of devotion to their husband instead of a way to prevent their capture and disgrace.\n\nAlthough there are many other records of forced Sati practice, this one is the most recent and there have been attempts by the Mughals and British to ban these. (According to the internet).\n\nFeels a bit odd that historically we have been condemning this practice as a dark spot on Indian culture yet never condemned or even mentioned the reasons which led to this practice. \n\nAgain, not saying sati isn't wrong. But we always should look at every such situation with nuance so that we can understand why they came to be and how they morphed into something ugly, so that we can do the same in our present. Because many such rules never come about inherently being bad and seem good on the surface."<br />Author: '_ironhearted_'  id: 'thn8tu'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/thn8tu/the_origins_of_sati_pratha/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Why 'Islamophobia' as a term shouldn't be taken seriously in India - and why the Polarization post watching 'The Kashmir Files' is justified."<br />Body: "Islamophobia is a term used in the US to tackle the anti-islam beliefs post 9/11 where every Muslim who came to the US was portrayed as a terrorist. Now many such Muslims came to the country usually for a well paying job and these were well educated, independent folks like you and me. US folks hadn't never seen the 'real Islamic culture' like from Pakistan so they never experienced the regular bomb blasts and violence associated with the same either, hence the term 'Islamophobia' was used to distinguished the educated ones who came to the US to make it big from the actual threat inducing scum of society which come from these areas, but they would never actually visit the US to wreak havoc.\n\n\nIndia on the other hand, we shouldn't use this term at all. We've seen the worst, we were treated not as humans but cockroaches. Hell I'd say in today's world even cockroaches are shown way more humanity. The way Kashmiris were killed in broad daylight, hell the movie didn't even show 5% of the brutality our brothers and sisters actually faced (No sorry libbus in the thread, I won't consider the KMs our brothers and sisters), and who wouldn't feel fear from these elements? We're always defending from the consistent threat that is Pakistan which thinks just because of a random philosophy some idiot said that all of India is already theirs to have and we're the ones roaming the nation for now. (This is the 'maksad' they keep mentioning boys where they want to invade it eventually). Hell they joke all the time about taking some actress and saying 'Tum Madhuri hume dedo but Kashmir lelo humse' etc, I'm sure you must have heard it too. I've heard it from regular citizens of the country. Contrast this with the Pak militants who asked for us to leave our women, the tribal and misogynistic portrayal of women being a reproductive device for these sex maniacs has been driving their good-for-nothing civilization and nothing else. We've seen the horrors firsthand, we should develop a good defense against these destructive forces or the whole India will become a Kashmir in the future.\n\n\nIn this case, I'm sorry to say but: Fuck Kashmiriyat and the whole idea behind brotherhood amongst different religions. If the other side wants only violence and to kick you out and treats you less because of your religious identity why wouldn't you hate them? Why this need of being nice all the time? They have made 0 ammends in their religion to adjust to the modern world. ZERO and I'm talking predominantly about the overwhelming Sunni pop from Pak and around and they teach us about modernity? I say fuck that.

      <li>Title::: 'Lesson for indian liberals'<br />Body: "There is also a lesson here for the Indian elites, tutored by the West, and now so used to lecturing Indian masses on the supposed dangers of “nationalism.” All it took was one crisis in Ukraine for the carefully constructed facade of Western liberalism to fall apart, sending the European continent back to a 1914 trench warfare mentality. The city of Munich just fired the conductor of its orchestra for being Russian. Right now, Russian speakers in Germany are feeling threatened, some are even facing attacks on their homes and businesses. At least at one hospital in Munich, a doctor refused to treat patients who speak Russian. Given the history of Germany, you would think that at least the Germans would realise the dangers of targeting an ethnic group like this. But, apparently they do not.\n\nBy contrast, Indian nationalism, driven by a simple love of our country, appears practically harmless. And yet, this nationalism has been written about in the most sinister terms in domestic and foreign media, often invoking Nazi comparisons. This nationalism is taunted daily by our intellectual class. They challenge our masses to prove their “tolerance” by singing songs about destruction of idols, penned by Pakistani poets no less. Think about all the aggression that India has faced from Pakistan in the last 25 years.\n\nThe fact is that neither Indian democracy, nor Indian nationalism, has anything to prove to anyone else. Those who defame either of these should be ashamed of themselves and they should start questioning their tutors in the West. The emergence of India from the woods will depend very clearly on choosing its own notions of democracy and nationalism emerging from our own bedrock of societal values and enlightened self-interest.\n\nTook this from\n[here](https://www.firstpost.com/world/western-double-speak-is-the-right-to-remain-neutral-during-war-a-part-of-white-privilege-10469591.html) Title of the article doesn't match the information above.

But the purpose of this post is not to rant about the sad state of affairs but to discuss with a positive mind some actionable blueprint to reclaim the Kasmir and solve the issue for once and forever. All points must be considered targeted towards the main Kashmir with the majority Jeeh@di population.  \n\n\n1. Create residential colonies for retired/active service persons from the military. \n2. Establish Anti-terrorism training institutes and institutes for other special services, Intelligence agencies. \n3. Establish new &amp; shift existing institutes for various other services if feasible and needed. Important Institutes like LBSNAA.\n4. Similarly, establish large government-aided universities, research institutes. Apart from contemporary subjects institutes focused on traditions of Ayurveda, Yoga, and Vedic education and sciences must be on priority.\n5. Once enough social and hard infrastructure is established private investments in the above sectors must be encouraged along with encouraging manufacturing &amp; industries generating large employment opportunities. Manufacturing in defense and semiconductors and other sectors which India is envisioning establishing must be redirected towards Kashmir. The rest of India can do well on its own for a while. \n6. Institutes relating to cultural aspects, arts, theatre, and other performing arts must be promoted. The goal is to create this whole vibrant and alive eco-system.\n7. An aggressive campaign for promoting tourism in Kashmir Valley must be initiated once a largely peaceful environment is established. Hotels, allied services, and infrastructure must be created. If needed government must allow Visa-free travel for foreigners with exceptions like Pakistan, Turkey etc. Security at this point won't be a big concern if prior things are established. Exposing Kashmir to foreigners will further reinforce the security aspect because Jeehadi society does anything there will be the whole world to see in black &amp; white the true nature of any event. It will also bust the propaganda that Kashmir wants freedom because Indian security forces do crimes against the local Mulzim population and not for the fact that Jeeh@di society can't live with Kafir India.\n8. In short, the motive of all the above efforts must be to change the demographics of Kashmir and enable inflow in large numbers of the Non-Jeeh@di peace-loving people, people minding their own businesses (literally), people who want to admire the true gift that nature has given us, people who want to experience the heaven on earth alive and not after expl@dng themselves in crowds.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The purpose of the post is to initiate a discussion among the young and upcoming generation and not inform intellectuals about what needs to be done as they already know better than someone like me.\n\n**PS: Add your own thoughts and points.**"<br />Author: 'abhiccc1'  id: 'th0q78'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/th0q78/mission_sanatana_kashmir_reclaimed_the_masterplan/</li>

      <li>Title::: '2002 Gujarat Files'<br />Body: 'Nanavati Panel Report : Junks State Government complicity in abetting Riots. rather puts blame on dereliction of duty on Joint Police Commissioner. No one denies that muslims were targeted and killed because of their religion. But There were also some hindu deaths. Of the dead, 790 were Muslim and 254 Hindu- official statistics.  \nSo , faith-based violence was from both the sides. And Burning of Train was the lightning spark.\n\nFrom what I have gathered , Godhra is a communal sensitive area. Riots have been a regular feature of this city. 1925, 28, 46,48 50,53,80,81,85,86, 88,89, 1990, 1991 , 1992. So mutual fear, prejudices and biases were present in both sides of the community.\n\nWhen news spread about Train burning, their biases took over rationality. And it is expected in a communally sensitive area. And Media added fuel to fire. See nanavati panel recommendation to media.  \n[https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/2002-gujarat-riots-what-nanavati-panel-found-6162553/](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/2002-gujarat-riots-what-nanavati-panel-found-6162553/)\n\nSo the question comes back to who started the fire ?  \nBanerjee commission Report : Said it was accidental fire but Gujarat HC quashed it.  \nNanavati Commission report: Said it was a preplanned event. Haji Ibrahim Umarji, a cleric in Godhra,an retd officer named Nanu miyan, a perpetrator Razzak Kurkur, were accussed by the report. Based on this report Gujarat HC gave verdict.  \nGujarat Forensic science laboratory: also said an inflammable liquid was poured from outside.  \nSee the link for reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra\\_train\\_burning#:\\~:text=A%20study%20conducted%20by%20the,the%20coach%20below%20the%20windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra_train_burning#:~:text=A%20study%20conducted%20by%20the,the%20coach%20below%20the%20windows).\n\n**So in a pre planned event few muslims burned karsevaks alive. And then cycle of violence continued**. State did not abet the riot. Infact State Police Officers felt helpless to stop the mob. The pressure of mob was so much that Gujarat state government had to seek help of neighbouring state police but they did not help bcz they were congress ruled state.  \n\n\nAnd Gujarat files book of Rana Ayub: In her book, she has not been objective. She has not even mentioned hindu deaths. her work has no evidentiary value in court - SC itself said that.  \nAnd Final solution documentary: I have seen it and it shows the massacre perpetrated by Hindu mob on muslim. But that is one sided. how come 254 hindus died then.\n\nSo in conclusion I have to say:  \nIN a religious riot, both sides die. And when mob loses its mind state cant do anything.  \nDo not equate Gujarat riot with Kashmir genocide. In Kashmir, It was targeted killing of hindus or muslims who didnt want to join Pakistan, and state government was complicit in it. And unlike gujarat riot which ended in 1-2 days, Hindus are being killed since 1300 AD. Day by day . One at a time. Read about Shah Mir Dynasty and Butshikan. And current demography.\n\nAnd please do not put question on everything: saying : Oh the reports are biased. OH forensic science labs are biased. Oh the judiciary is biased. There is no end to it. Ayodhya Judgement was also questioned.   \n\n\nAm I missing something from Gujarat Files script ?

Infuriated Hiranyakashipu gave cruel punishments and finally Holika, Prahlada’s evil aunt tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. As the fire roared, Holika burned while Prahlada survived.\n\n[Prahlad with Holika](https://preview.redd.it/fw0c0ecd33o81.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab6cff4baf441fd64bb53c5701ade39359e9f04)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiranyakashipu eventually becomes so angry and upset went to meet Prahlada as he refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is all-pervading and omnipresent.\xa0To which Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if \'his Vishnu\' is in it. The king got up from his throne in fury and hit the pillar with his mace. And to his surprise! The pillar cracked with a thundering sound and\xa0Vishnu\xa0appeared there in the form of Narasimha. **One half of his body was of a lion and the other half of a man.

But at last, Narsimha caught hold of him and dragged him towards the threshold. \\*\\*There, he put Hiranyakashipu on thighs and tore his belly with his terrifying nails.\\*\\*Even after killing Hiranyakashipu none of the gods(Lord Shiva, Brahma) were able to calm Narasimha\'s fury, So all the gods and goddesses called His consort, the goddess Lakshmi, but she was also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada was presented to Narasimha. He was pacified when Prahlad touched his feet.\xa0Lord Narsimha then asked Prahlad to seek some boon. Prahlad said: **“You are my true Lord.

      <li>Title::: 'Kashmir Files, my take'<br />Body: "\n\nTLDR: Classic Psychology Games at a scale.\n\nMy Muslims friends weren't up for watching the movie. They ask me if they should watch it or not. I am staunch Hindu and but not religious and don't give a fuck about any religion.\n\nI gave them unbiased reviews, if any stupid person watches this movie - instant Muslim hatred. And movie has shown the history as per their convinience. Nothing else but it will drive any person to it who have no brains.\n\nThe movie played psychological tricks to infuse Muslim hatred. Pure Muslim hatred no pakistani or brainwashing mentioned just Muslims and their affection for Pakistan.\n\nPeople are crying in theatres because of Gore factor, no hindi movie I have seen has this level of Gore and it leaps and bounds in the last scene which was deliberately stretched to invoke emotions.\n\nCompletely agree that history has to be told and in the purest form but this movie is far from it. They conviniently carved out a part of history and portrayed it. No background at all. Just the  oppression. No mention of why it gained momentum and why the genocide actually happened.\n\nwe have a selected events we want to feel bad for. There was a huge massacre even larger than this and both parties were affected. But that's not a matter of concern or history to be touched on. Because wahan pe kisiko mileage nahi no clear winner. But 20x more relocation than KP and involved both h and m  and both of them lost. Yes I am talking about the 1947 partition.\n\nTo open the eyes, 1st watch Kashmir genesis video from WION on yt. You would know why the fuck up started in the first place.\n\n2nd- why army didn't respond to it that actively.\n\nReality is India was absolutely fucked in that time of history. Our economy was screwed and army was fighting in the east and in the Sri Lanka. Our only good friend in the world was USSR who was fucked too because of Afghanistan situation and US had complete control of things. Also, USA hated our guts for many things in the past.\n\nUSA was writing blank cheques to Pakistan for fueling unrest in Afghanistan to oust USSR and Pakistan used that might on this side of the border as well. The kashmir govt was almost in Pakistan's Lap. Being in completely helpless situation if India would have used force to do anything in this case. We could have lost kashmir completely. Direct conflict would not have got anything done for us.\n\nHence there was nothing much anyone could do anything and they knew this and went ahead with the genocide.\n\nNow comes the question, what we could learn/do. Nothing. There's nothing to do, nothing to learn. It's just an unfortunate incident like earthquake flood or any other calamity. Because there was nothing anyone could do to save people from it.\n\nNow since Article 370 gone there's absolutely nothing stopping the affected KP's to go back and stay there even a Andamani person can go and live in Kashmir.\n\nThis movie is blown out of proportion, I do have sympathy for pandits but the way things are going out of hands it's just reducing. I do feel sorry about it but please try to understand the position of everything that point of time.\n\nAnd many Hindus saying watch it just because nothing like this should happen in future. Now C'mon we are not India from 90's but now we shoot missiles and call it mistake and no one bats an eye.\n\nThis kind off unrest can be taken care by a state level itself and don't even have to enforce any central agencies.\n\nThis kind off unrest is only a psychology demotivating factor for charged up M's and it happens in cycles. Nothing will happen to anyone Riots are out of pictures. But only to tone down the voices and nonsense like that Hijab thing.\n\nWe are favored in the world because of real peace loving history and present and no govt will want to fuck that up. Now we have the govt who has answers to any nonsense against India and we are still the peaceful country (no, sarcasm. Speaking the truth)\n\nWhat we should have is a system that don't divide and keep all the humans united for common progress and prosperity. Just like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Jinnah (pre-stupidized version of Jinnah) that was some unity and had too much power against the then oppressors. British conviniently created a rift and left us fighting amongst us. That's the reason we are still amongst the countries like in middle east. If you see European Union there's no extremism of any sort (don't invoke France here, they have their own reasons) they are united and have a common goal of prosperity. They are par of religion and have countries with highest human development index.\n\nThe top have us divided even now and we like idiots fell into it and act upon it. It should not happen we have to somehow bring religion in the closed doors of our homes and not spread outside with hatred. All the top one's who do it are friends in the background and it's us who work for them subconsciously and they enjoy the show. \n\nAnd about the govt/political parties. I like the one we have now. Determined, created good image of India and I have personally benefited by the policies and actions. So I have absolutely no hate but only praises but when I see them venturing into this gambit I feel the need to speak up.\n\n\nPlease counter me with toughest of questions and facts which I won't be able defend."<br />Author: 'Astalavista85'  id: 'tguq1v'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tguq1v/kashmir_files_my_take/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Learn the heartwarming, uplifting reason why hindus should buy more fruits everyday during ramadan.'<br />Body: 'If you study the price of fruits during the year, it spikes every year during ramadan.  Bananas go from 6 pc for ₹10 to 6pc for ₹20 and sometimes even higher.  Every other fruit prices double or triple.\n\nBecause of this hindus stop buying fruits, or buy less fruits.  When actually, to show how big hearted, loving and kind they are, and to renew their secular credentials, hindus - even poor hindus - should buy more fruit.\n\nDuring ramadan muslims eat more fruit.  This increases the demand for fruit and causes the price rise.  But if this was the only reason, the prices would rise ever so slightly.  It is not as if muslims are suddenly eating 10 times the fruits.  Which is what they need to do to increase the prices 2-3 times.  The bigger reason for the steep rise in prices is that the extra money is used to provide muslims free fruits.\n\nWhen you buy 6 pc of bananas for ₹20, you are also paying for 6 pc of bananas to be distributed among muslims for free.  Every fruit you buy ensures that muslims get the same fruit for free.\n\nThis is the most humanitarian BOGO.  not buy one get one, but buy one **gift** one.\n\nHindus have a duty to ensure that muslims are giving everything they need and more.  No muslim should ever feel shame for the violence they do.  No muslim should ever feel guilt for the crimes they do.  If muslims want to destroy temples and desecrate idols, hindus should offer them free transportation, tools, food, pay them handsomely, applaud while they are demolishing the temples, congratulate the after they are done, and fund the building of mosque at that site.  After all we are the ones who are saying the whole world is one family.  If one of the family member loses big time in gambling, we must all sell all our assets, liquidate all our savings to help pay off that debt.  If we are a family, we must always be united, even if it means we are ruined.\n\nAlso if you look at it, Ramadan is made up of two words, Rama which is the Lord Rama to whom all hindus pray, and Dan which is the hindu tradition of donating. \n\nSo hindus buy fruits and post pics using the hashtags #BOGO #RamadanDan'<br />Author: 'cantstartup'  id: 'tguezl'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tguezl/learn_the_heartwarming_uplifting_reason_why/</li>

Mel Gibson has many interviews in which they try to make him look like a buffon but with his superior intellect he makes them eat their own words. Similiar thing happened when Vivek was interviewed by Newslaundry and its founder tried to corner him but using his superior knowledge of philosophy, and time space continum he distorted the whole fabric of the question and confused the interviewer and liberal viewers but who knew him and follow him were really impressed by his intellect. Mel Gibson was branded Anti semite and Vivek is now branded as islamophobic.

The goal is to make the host country slowly so unstable such that all hell breaks loose, and a puppet government can be installed.\n\nCountries fund color revolutions not only in enemy countries, but even in friend countries in attempt to get rid of their autonomous government policies. \n\nHow to identify a color revolutions and why Farmer protest/Hijab controversy/Delhi Riots are attempts to destabilize India and eventually install a puppet government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Color revolutions only happen during elections, midst of a political or economic crisis. Farmer protest happened just after covid, we were at our peak weakness. They climbed Red fort and even attempted to reach to Parliament. \n2. Color revolutions exaggerate social problems to provoke people to go to streets. So called "fascism". Muh democracy. Muh dictatorship. We all know how exaggerated these problems are.\n3. Color revolutions usually happen in developing countries that are "likely" to support the imperialist powers but also are too autonomous.\n4. Slogans commonly used are: Democracy, Freedom. Even though most local people don\'t identify with "freedom" in the host countries. \n5. Demands are usually vague, and constanly changing. Recall how the demands of farmers protest kept changing? How vague they were? Recall how they say Hijab but they are wearking Burka?\n6. The American capitalist media will cover the color revolutions in what seems like a coordinated responses. Riannah, all western media, fkn fkers. Recall how all this happened, during Farmer protest. Converage seems to very very vague and one-sided.\n7. Once the protest is big enough, so that lives of people are heavily disrupted, NGOs and foreign governments will start speaking in support of these so called protestors to legitimize foreign intervention.  Recall Farmer protest?\n8. The goal of color revolution is to slowly build chaos and instability until a puppet can be installed. Check:-&gt; Delhi Riots, Farmer protest -&gt; Hijab case. Expect many many more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rest my case. \n\nExpect many many more in India. CIA wants to destabilize south asia so that it can install puppet government here. In India and Bangladesh.\n\nRecall, that Bangladesh Hindu violence, when a random muslim boy just walks into a temple and places quran on Hanuman ji\'s feet and results in huge violence in the country? I am very sure that it was also an attempt to destabilize the region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe west needs a puppet south asia in its fight with China. And it will attempt to destabilize country and use every method to do it.\n\nWhat we have to do? We have to stand our ground. Distance ourselves from the west.

I knew I was in for a harrowing experience but what happened completely shocked me. I went in the theatre and was surprised at the low crowd but I guess the timing I chose was such. I had a feeling that the movie would have some scenes that would be difficult to digest but I had no idea. At certain scenes it was difficult to hold back and eventually the tears started rolling down my eyes. I was rocked to the core at the brutality suffered by these people and I was crying as I was tightly gripping the armrests.\n\nSuddenly I hear a few people giggling behind me. I turned around to see some youngsters who looked like they were left-leaning (the cancer of our country) and I could see a couple of them texting while the others were laughing at the brutality going on-screen. I returned my eyes to the screen and instantly the tears started again. But there was one more thing I failed to notice.\n\nMy tears had caused a small pool to form around me and that pool was slowly growing. Eventually, the water started rising and it reached the level of the last row in the hall. I know this because the youngsters had raised their voices and were saying things like "Why doesn\'t the Modi govt. dry up our theatres??" and "As Hindus, we need to save this water for the Muslim community while ensuring that the Hindus of this land beg for water" etc.\n\nThe pool of tears had grown alarmingly large and deep. I tried to stop but the movie\'s depiction of the injustice and brutality just kept shaking me to the core, One of the youngsters took a dive and tried to reach me underwater but at this point, the velocity of tears coming out of my eyes had reached lightspeed and it simply cut through him. As the remaining youngsters\' screams got drowned out by the water I could feel my oxygen levels lowering and I felt myself slipping out of consciousness. I could hear the voice of Savarkar tell me to hang on but I knew it was too late....until\n\nThe exit doors opened and all the tear-water flooded out. I opened my eyes to weakly see Vivek Agnihotri lift me up and carry me out. As he did, I could hear the applause of millions of true Indians as I had finally watched the Kashmir Files and come out alive and sane for the first time. I heard Vivek sir get a call from the Oscars but he cut the call. When I asked him why, he said they had been pestering him to let the Kashmir Files be nominated as they felt it would surely win, but he didn\'t want western recognition. I feel we should at the very least nominate this hero for a National Award if not a Bharat Ratna./s'<br />Author: 'drdonkeyboner'  id: 'tgg872'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tgg872/my_experience_while_watching_the_kashmir_files/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My Experience after watching The Kashmir Files.'<br />Body: 'So, Like any other Indian who wanted to know what happened to the “**Kashmiri Pandits**”, I booked a ticket for the 9 PM show in Inox. \n\nAs soon as I entered the screen and occupied the seats (It was a House Full show), I saw people entering the screen in groups (Apparently they had contacted a broker to book seats in Mass). \n\nSince no seats were Available, A small quarrel started for seats and later turned into a big one. While all this was going on people were shouting “ **Bharat Mata ki Jai**”, “**Vande Mataram**”, **“Jai Shri Ram”**. The theatre manager had to come to the screen and he was sorting out the issue. Later all the bulk tickets were moved on to a different screen (never happened in inox). \n\nSoon the lights went down and chants of “Bharat Mata ki Jai” also started to decrease. \n\nThe Movie started to hit me from the first scene itself. The Cruelty towards Sachin, shiva etc. I was about to digest that, then comes the second bomb. Where the neighbour betrays and Sharda is forced to eat blood mixed rice. \n\nAlthough I would not want to give out spoilers, I can only imagine what the people (Kashmiri Pandits) have been through. A few of the scenes were so traumatic to watch that I could not stop but utter “**Fuck dude, how can someone be soo cruel**”. The few killings were so inhumane like the killing of Sharda Pandit, Shiva Pandit, Mr Kaul and his son made my blood boil and my eyes moist. But what made my tears uncontrollable was the death of Pushkar Nath Pandit (Beautifully Portrayed by Anupam Kher). Although names have been changed in the movie, We clearly know the university which was behind all these incidents. \n\nAt last, when the movie ended, I couldn’t get up from my seat. It took me 5 minutes to regain my sanity and when I left the theatre, I was completely silent and to myself. The Movie may not have great item numbers etc, but it will stay with me forever. \n\nLast but not least.

Recent events (Russia) have made several people realise the need of indigenous products and manufacturing.  There was a company started in 1960s for achieving the same purpose but is currently in need of young supporters. A little background about hmt: \n\nHmt(Hindustan machine tools) was the brainchild of Independant India's first government for kickstarting indian manufacturing industry. It's main objective was to reduce India's dependance on foreign (swiss) watches and started manufacturing mechanical watches, tractors and other equipments in 1960s. They learned from Citizen company and from 1970s onwards were 100% made in India. Everything from the case to the machinery inside was indigenous. This is unheard of in the watch industry and most watch companies outsource spare parts. Hmt were affordable, reliable and very popular until 90s. There used to be long lines in front of hmt shops to get a Kanchan watch. But they were slow to adapt to quartz watches and foreign competition. It lost to competition and became a loss making company. It still had a chance with better advertising and management.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of privatisation or changing the management HMT factories were shut down in 2016 laying off almost all of its employees and ending 60 year old legacy. Anyways, since HMT watches were still good a small community of watch lovers continued to buy them. So far that was restarted (sort of) 2 years ago by selling old stock and assembling rest from outsourced parts. There is a slight chance it will restart manufacturing in India if there is enough demand. But young generation (below 30) who are obsessed with Seiko, orient or other Swiss brand have no idea about hmt. So as a young hmt lover myself, I thought it one shout-out post to this company and its great watches that would be great.\n\nCurrently hmt sub has less than 200 members. It's a shame as even foreigners have realised how great hmt watches are (many videos of foreigners reviewing hmts) and there Is demand for hmt in USA, Europe,etc. HMT currently has a website through which it sells its watches ,most popular one checking out are: Kohinoor ,Pilot, Stellar. These watches are worth their price 10 times over, I have around 10 hmt watches. One Rs8,000 hmt is as good as a Seiko or orient watch worth Rs25,000. One hmt I own from 1979 still works.

It so happened that in the house opposite to ours a snake sneaked in (I guess its Russel's Viper). A sake catcher was called and he bought it out in open on to street. And I saw it. I still remember vaguely. That night I had dreams of Snakes and I was very afraid. I couldn't sleep. I woke up my elder sister and told her that I was unable to sleep and I was afraid. She told me to sleep by her side and she put her hand over my chest, tapping a little and I could sleep that night.\n\nIt's not that I remember this incident completely but later on she used to tell this incident in family circles how afraid I was of Snakes. But I do have vague memories.  And yes, even today Snakes do visit my dreams in a guest role and have their show.\n\nWhen I travel on a long flight 10-12 hour flight, say SG to SFO, I dream that all of a sudden the bottom of my chair would open up and I am in a free fall. This didn't disturb my sleep though. But its quite vivid and I can remember. \n\nAnother dream I remember is sitting on top of a very long tower and looking down.

      <li>Title::: 'Opinion - Vivek Agnihotri should tackle the truth about Khilafat movement, 1946 indian general elections and the mayhem that followed next.'<br />Body: 'It should examine in detail how Mohandas Gandhi made the blunder of supporting the Shaukat Ali and co. backed Khilafat movement that united indian muslims for a foreign cause which ultimately had huge bearing on the push for the creation of Pakistan. \n\nThe movement was also associated with large scale killings in the form of Moplah genocide of Hindus. \n\nTaken from a Pgurus article - \n\n"In 1921,\xa0moplah rebellion\xa0began as a reaction against the crackdown of Khilafat Movement by the British authorities. The rebellion started with the minor clashes between Muslims and the police, but the violence soon spread across the region. Muslims attacked the police stations, government offices and looted the government treasuries.\n\nDuring the rebellion thousands of Hindus were killed, hundreds of women were raped. Annie Besant reported that Muslims of moplah forcibly converted many Hindus, drove away Hindus who renounce the Islam who were totaling to more than 100,000. Despite this brutal incident, Mahatma Gandhi showed his sympathy on moplahs by writing, “It’s wrong to say that Islam has employed force. No religion in this world has spread through the use of force. No Musalman, to my knowledge, has ever approved of compulsion”. This shows how the congress and Gandhi practiced the double dealings in politics." \n\nLord Reading viceroy of India announced in his\xa0speech, of 20 August 1921″A few Europeans and many Hindus have been murdered, communications have been sacked, houses of Europeans and Hindus were burnt. The result had been temporary collapse of civilian government. European and Hindu refugees of all classes are concentrated at Calicut and it is satisfactory to note that they are safe there. Those who are responsible for this grave outbreak of violence and crime must be brought to the justice and made suffer the punishment of the guilty”. Now, let us see how Gandhi overlooked the men slaughtering, women raping of Moplah Muslims. In his writing Gandhi concluded that “The moplah’s are among the bravest in the land and they are god fearing”.\n\nDr. B.R. Ambedkar’s take on Gandhi for his appeasement politics by quoting “Gandhi has never called the Muslims to account even when they have been guilty of gross crimes against Hindus. It is notorious fact that many prominent Hindus who had offended the religious susceptibilities of the Muslims have been murdered by some fanatic Musalmans. The leading Muslims never condemned these criminals. This attitude of the Muslims is understandable. What is not understandable is the attitude of Mr. Gandhi”.\n\nhttps://www.pgurus.com/politics-appeasement-dangerous-game/amp/\n\nAlso what a lot of people don\'t know is that muslims all over India overwhelmingly supported the muslim league during the 1946 indian provincial elections. That was immediately followed by a call to violence by Jinnah in Bengal to slaughter any hindu at sight till his demand for Pakistan wasn\'t accepted - Direct Action Day. \n\nAn even bloodier partition followed, all under the watch of the alleged father of the nation - Mohandas Gandhi, wherer millions were killed and displaced. \n\nMaybe Agnihotri can tackle the entire period between 1919 - 1947 and show the truth of hindu-muslim relations in that period, and the role of Congress in the partition of the country. Tackle the truth instead of the Congressi propaganda that we are fed since childhood.'<br />Author: 'SwamiVivekamunun'  id: 'tgabbf'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tgabbf/opinion_vivek_agnihotri_should_tackle_the_truth/</li>

I\'m getting some flashbacks from my childhood and idk they are really disturbing to me.\n\n▪︎When I was 2-3 years old my mom beating me really hard with a hanger because I had looked at the fruits my brothers (my badi mummy\'s sons) were eating. My family were really poor at that time and we were living at my badi mummy house. My badi mummy is a really cruel person and idk why but she hates me and my mom. So when I was looking at those fruits because I just wanted to taste them (I wasn\'t allowed to eat them) my badi mummy noticed and started telling my mom that "me bahiya ke khane pe nazer laga rahi hu" and my mom started beating me so much after that...\n\n▪︎I was like 3-4 years old and Idk what I did but I was running from my mom in fear and then I locked myself up in the bathroom. I was so scared that I started vomiting inside...the memory is quite unclear but it\'s really scary to watch myself in so much fear...\n\n▪︎I was like 4 at that time and I was just drinking my milk at my brother\'s bed. I by mistakenly spilled the milk on the bed when my mom saw that she was outrageous about it (apparently she thought that once again badi mummy is going spto say something about me) so she started yelling at me. I was so afraid that I started running around the house to save myself...my brothers were laughing at this...idk what happened next but the fear in my eyes was so terrifying.\n\nThere were few other memories like that too like when mom locked me in a dark room, or mom literally throwing me on sofa etc it was all scary to remember...and trust me I was always a goody two shoes...I never did anything mischievous things but still mom use to beat me...\n\nI don\'t remember much about my childhood but all of these seems like messed up my brain because I remember beating myself when i was merely 7 years old (i still do it). Now whenever anyone yells at me I started crying and thinking about killing myself...idk why i get so afraid...many times I end up trying to kill myself (5-6 times). \n\nNow I\'m confused about what happened to me was really abuse or serious?

Just see how your body reacts on national anthem, similarly look at impact on mind when you here -" नमस्ते सदा वत्सले मातृभूमे , त्वया हिन्दुभूमे सुखं वर्धितोऽहम्। महामङ्गले पुण्यभूमे त्वदर्थे , पतत्वेष कायो नमस्ते नमस्ते॥१॥  \nप्रभो शक्तिमन् " हिन्दुराष्ट्राङ्गभूता " इमे सादरं त्वां नमामो वयम् ! "\n\nAs said " create you own elites" because they are followed by masses in urban and rural areas !\n\nWhy rich Hindus or Urban kids are mostly deracinated, because of Anglo-lifestyle deeply influenced by Hollywood +OTTs+musics. Whereas STEM background from Tier 2,3 are now proud unapologetic Hindus, look at Gaurav Taneja, you may disagree with his creativeness, but see he is now elite.\n\nSo, in my opinion, study and enter the top colleges - whether IITs, foreign institutes, SRCC, Hindu etc then slowly build communities around you. You will find enough people to work with. This is where Hindutva is targeting, students - professors - intellectuals for next set of growth. This time be prepared, "Atheist Hindus will take up baton " just look at Savarkar\'s.\n\nThat time Aryan invasion theory was common knowledge , however V.D. Savarkar wrote very beautiful poetry with following lines :-\n\n""Some of us were Aryans and some Anaryans; but Ayars and Nayars—we were all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us are Brahmans and some Namashudras or Panchamas; but Brahmans or Chandalas—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us are Daxinatyas and some Gauds; but Gauds or Saraswatas—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us were Rakshasas and some Yakshas; but Rakshasas or Yakshas—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us were Vanaras and some Kinnaras; but Vanaras or Naras—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us are Jains and some Jangamas; but Jains or Jangamas—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nSome of us are monists, some, pantheists; some theists and some atheists. But monotheists or atheists—we are all Hindus and own a common blood.\n\nWe are not only a nation, but a Jati, a born brotherhood. Nothing else counts, it is after all a question of heart. We feel that the same ancient blood that coursed through the veins of Ram and Krishna, Buddha and Mahavir, Nanak and Chaitanya, Basava and Madhava, of Rohidas and Tiruvelluvar courses throughout Hindudom from vein to vein, pulsates from heart to heart. We feel we are a JATI, a race bound together by the dearest ties of blood and therefore it must be so""\n\nV.D. Savarkar. Hindutva, Pg 55-56 and from Sampath, Vikram.

      <li>Title::: 'Thoughts on the Medieval Nationalism of a Hindu Minister of the Golconda Sultan'<br />Body: '  \n\nRecently I came across the story of a Hindu minister of the Qutb Shahi sultan in Golconda who managed to get the Golconda Sultanate to celebrate the arrival of Shivaji and even provide him with an artillery force for his expedition further south. I found this in Dr Uday Kulkarni’s excellent book, [The Maratha Century](https://www.amazon.in/Maratha-Century-Uday-S-Kulkarni/dp/8192108082). \n\nI decided to look further into this minister and found a fascinating story. Madanna (the minister in question) and Akkanna were brothers who managed to gain a lot of power in the Qutb Shahi sultanate. They did this through talent for governing and a series of good political moves, and in the process, managed to completely change the Qutb Shahi state, for the good in my opinion. What’s even more fascinating is we actually have quotes from Akkanna talking about how they thought about their government. In a recorded discussion with a representative of the Dutch East India Co. he said the following – \n\n“..you yourself can imagine which government serves the king best, ours or that of the Moors \\[Muslims\\]; ours being fullheartedly devoted to the welfare of the country, while we are not people who have or seek other countries, but that of the Moors is only to the end of becoming rich and then to leave for those places which they consider to be either their fatherland or holy.”\n\nI think there are clear signs of a sort of nationalism here. This quote, along with a great summary of the era is explained in a chapter on the brothers in a book named [Xenophobia in Seventeenth Century India by Kruijtzer Griz](https://www.academia.edu/544075/Xenophobia_in_Seventeenth_Century_India) (the PDF is free on Academia.org! A fascinating book IMO). The brothers were very clear that they did not want to conquer lands beyond their established borders or gain any glory elsewhere. They were very clear what their home was and who their people were. \n\nThey also seem to have agreed with Chatrapati Shivaji in his opinion on Deccani patriotism according to Kruijtzer (an explanation of Shivaji’s thoughts on this topic with the help of a letter from Shivaji to the commander of the Bijapur garrison is included in the Kruijtzer’s book and is extremely interesting). How I understand it is there seems to have been three ‘parties’ or factions in the Qutb Shahi court, the foreigner Muslims, Deccani Muslims and Hindu Brahmins. Of course, Madanna and Akkanna were leaders of the Hindu Brahmin group but they seemed to have sided with Deccani Muslims in terms of appointments to posts and things like that when not picking from their own group.\n\nA point that I find interesting, in terms of my own political conservative leaning, Madanna and Akkanna effectively took over the reigns of power in the Qutb Shahi Sultanate without any real bloodshed or upheavals. At one point, Madanna had the seal of the Sultan in his possession after the Sultan had pawned it to him for an allowance to satiate his urges (the sultan seems to have been a junkie). They created such a huge change in the government, filling it with people from their community, that the Dutch called it the Brahmin revolution. However, there was no revolution! \n\nNone of the institutions of government were destroyed. Instead, they used the already existing institutions, with modifications, to gain power and run a government in the way they believed it needed to be run. As a result, they were able to build new temples, fund existing temples, build rest stops for travelers, feed various groups of people etc. They were even able to avoid war, more or less, until Aurangzeb sent his armies to oust the Brahmins that had taken control.\n\nWhen the Mughal armies came, they were murdered, along with a large number of people form their community. However, the changes they had created, the institutions they had erected and the power they had given to people who agreed with them meant that their murder was only a blip. Not long after they were gone, Brahmins, and Hindus in general, regained power in the Qutb Shahi Sultanate. They maintained this status quo until the Mughal Armies returned and took control of the Qutb Shahi territories a few years later.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of how Chatrapati Shahu insisted on keeping a Mughal on the throne in Delhi. By doing so, the Marathas ensured the institution of the Mughal monarchy continued to exist. That way they could use their influence over it to become de facto rulers of North India if not the de jure rulers in a few places.\n\nMaybe the wisdom of some of these people has lessons for us against revolutionary thinking and more towards a conservative approach towards change. Uphold the institutions but modify them as you see fit. Do it slowly and deliberately so that you see the pitfalls arriving as they come. When you destroy the institutions, you have created chaos and then you are playing dice instead of strategizing.'<br />Author: 'qwertyuiop885'  id: 'tg200c'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tg200c/thoughts_on_the_medieval_nationalism_of_a_hindu/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Kotak bank's lousy customer service"<br />Body: "**TLDR: Repeated telemarketing calls. Forced to accept a credit card after repeatedly refusing it. Customer care hasn't been of any help. Card has been dispatched. What should I do?**\n\nI have been a loyal Kotak bank customer for the past 4 years. Been very happy with their service and never faced any issues. Whenever someone would ask for recommendations for a good bank, I would always suggest people to go for Kotak bank. But not anymore.\n\nNote, I am currently a student and have no time from Monday to Saturday to visit a bank due to my interactive online classes. \n\nThe past 4 months I have been getting calls for a Royal signature credit card. I am an 811 savings account holder and I don't need the card. I found no great benefits with it and would prefer avoiding one more credit card. I have a healthy credit score. \n\nInitially the calls were once in two weeks, from February it became once a month, and from this March I have been getting a call everyday. On one day I got two calls. I had already selected DND on 1909 a few years back.\n\nPast two weeks I requested  every caller to please remove my name from the list. They said they wouldn't call back again. But the catch is , which I found it through asking a few of them is that an excel sheet had been sent to various individuals, and they have to call everyone on that list. It's not centralised or allocated, just a bunch of spam callers authorised by the banks inept management. \n\nI couldn't keep blocking numbers because it would keep changing.\n\nThe callers can't remove my name from the list supposedly.\n\nCustomer care can't stop these calls and asked me to go through the website\n\nThe website link is broken after submission [https://www.kotak.com/j1001card/CardStatus/donotcall.jsp](https://www.kotak.com/j1001card/CardStatus/donotcall.jsp)\n\n Cannot send an email via their own website's write to us option, it keeps failing.\n\nFinally found an email ID and sent it on that. They quote that  'I authorised Kotak Mahindra Bank to call on the above mentioned number and this consent will override in case of a registry with DNC/NDNC. ' Obviously this doesn't mention telemarketing and any sane person would assume the bank would call only for important issues.\n\nAs I mentioned previously I was unable to visit my bank due to my college hours, but I wish I had called them or waited before doing the following stupidity.\n\nSo the callers provided me with a solution, they forwarded my number to some head office, they needed me to apply for the card to be able to generate a ticket for removing MY name from their list.\n\nI had to authorise them to access Experian, Cibil, etc. I had to allow them to mail me a card. And then I gave them the application number verbally, while I was assured that I would get an email within 24 hours showing a cancelled status.\n\nI called them after 24 hours on not receiving an email, but instead receiving an SMS saying that the card has been dispatched and will arrive in 3 days.\n\nA new person answered the call and says that I should have received a call from the credit card issuers and I can deny it then, or I can refuse to receive the courier at the door. Secondly she assures me she'll remove my name from the list from her end, and it didn't require all the above complicated steps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question: What do I do? Do I return the card at the door or accept it quietly?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I am concerned about my credit score getting affected, and I don't want a card. I feel I have been made a fool off and taken advantage off. I should have gone to my bank but I just didn't have the time. I don't have any recordings of the calls."<br />Author: 'mod_in_the_making'  id: 'tflyyc'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tflyyc/kotak_banks_lousy_customer_service/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why did Veer Sawarkar form the Hindu Mahasabha if he was atheist?. An old Write-Up.'<br />Body: "Thought it was a good time to repost this old write-up.  \n\n\nCopied from: \\[Trilochana Rout's answer to **Why did Veer Sawarkar form Hindu Mahasabha if he was atheist?**\\]([https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Veer-Sawarkar-form-Hindu-Mahasabha-if-he-was-atheist/answer/Trilochana-Rout](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Veer-Sawarkar-form-Hindu-Mahasabha-if-he-was-atheist/answer/Trilochana-Rout))\n\n\\-------------\n\n Culture is the physical manifestation of an individual's spiritual immortality. We humans- despite our mortal bodies, crude natures &amp; flawed minds- are luminous beings who can exist for millennia, travel across oceans at will, and speak to entire generations at once- under the right conditions. For this one &amp; only one condition must be met- **the individual must overcome their delusions of mortality &amp; instead identify with an immortal reality.**\n\n**Once that is done, all else follows.**\n\n&gt; *vidyamkavidyamkayastadvedobhayamsaha*  \n*avidyayamrtyumtirtvavidyayamrtamasnute* \n\n The primary fallacy the average Atheist makes in the course of their reading is their belief that they've somehow slipped off the chains of religion's delusion &amp; developed some sort of individualistic freedom. That's nonsense. The only thing they've done is exchange one set of chains for another. There is absolutely no difference between the rituals of organized religion &amp; the Flag marches of Communism- or for that matter, Liberal Socialism. There is no Heaven- religious or liberal. There was never any heaven. **Merely duty- never-ending thankless duty, as part of a unknowing, all-knowing greater being with no sense of individual good, evil or even indifference.**\n\n**That is what the Bhagavad Gita actually says.**\n\nThat is what Liberals don't understand. Human beings want to, have to be part of a greater whole. This sentiment is the very basis of Humanity, its civilizations &amp; its ethos. Religion- like all ideologies, is merely another set of lies meant to justify the existence of yet another unjust, exploitative society (because all 'societies' by their very collective existence, are unjust &amp; exploitative of the individual. But that is okay- because Human Beings either want to exploit or be exploited themselves. Even the oh-so-holy Liberals are bound by their own set of untruths, and thus must constantly be justifying &amp; arguing over a group of nonentities. They do not see that their stand of absolute knowledge is no different from that adopted by the Christians &amp; Muslims when they were persecuting/ being persecuted by the Pagans who preceded them.\n\n&gt; *Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without*  \n*mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.* \n\n **There is not a single argument Liberals have that hasn't been raised ten thousand times earlier**\\- by St Thomas Aquinas, by Lao Tzu, by the Buddha himself, by the Mahabharata. There is not a single argument in the *God Delusion* that hasn't been discussed far more exhaustively, dedicatedly &amp; comprehensively in the Tripitakas. There isn't a single criticism of the Bible that wasn't known to or countered by St Thomas Aquinas.\n\nThe individuals concerned- St Thomas Aquinas, the Buddha- were not only far more intelligent, learned &amp; enlightened- than your Liberal thinks, they were, in all probability, some of the most intelligent beings to grace this species. **The idea that they were foolish enough to fall under some sort of superstitious nonsense is ridiculous. They- we believe because we choose to.** We chose to in order to defend our chosen group. The virtues or sins of this group- whether this group be Christians, Hindus, Muslims or even the people known in certain circles as 'Sickulars'- don't even figure in this equation.\n\n&gt; *“For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?”* \n\n **Thus we clearly see that the tribe is the fundamental necessity as well as the ultimate goal of Human existence**. How this tribe defines itself is called 'culture' &amp; this 'culture' in turn can be defined by multiple factors- race, religion, the Communist Manifesto, the Mein Kampf, Nietzsche, the God Delusion- &amp; of course, organized religion. **Any tribe, by virtue of the numerical superiority &amp; philosophical strength it provides to its members, is superior to any number of individuals &amp; thus, dominates the latter through slaughter &amp; plunder.**\n\nTherein lies the crux of why the three great Monotheistic faiths- Christianity, Islam &amp; Judaism- have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith in the World- save for in India &amp; China. **Paganism is simply not robust enough an ideology to effectively bind a people together.** It is too individualistic, offers too many choices, has too many freedoms. Don't mistake 'freedom' for 'the lack of oppression'. Murdering babies (though that might've been pure Roman anti-Carthiginian propaganda) or burning widows (which was the British digging up nearly extinct traditions as anti-Hindu propaganda) are oppression- but they do not connote a lack of 'freedom'. By the mere allowing of choice within one's spiritual- &amp; thus cultural fabric, paganism weakens the tribe- &amp; thus paves the way for its own demise.\n\n**Then why did India &amp; China survive? The answer is simple.** What is the biggest factor that sets India &amp; China apart from the World?\n\n&gt; *Quantity has a quality all of its own*\n\nAnd thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even Eternal Egypt or Mighty Rome could aspire to. Like dragons, we outfought our pagan foes. Like monkeys, we cheated the Mongol tumens. Like rats we out-bred our 'civilized' monotheist oppressors. Thus we survived.\n\nBut this state of affairs could've never continued for ever. Fertility rates fall. Schools open &amp; teach new lies in place of old ones. People, in their eternal search for suffering, hanker after new, more horrifying tortures. What people forget is that by leaving their religion, they are effectively abandoning their own culture- &amp; thus, the very basis of Human civilization. **True- they do gain a 'better', 'softer' society, a society more amenable to individualistic bliss- but such a state of affairs can only be temporary before such hedonistic loosely-bound members are swept away by hard-unthinking orthodoxy.** Hindus- long protected from the depredations of Islam &amp; Christianity by their vast population, multifarious ethnic divisions &amp; warlike nature- by the early 1900s were open to such de-culturalization thanks to several events not under this answer's purview.\n\nThus, it was evident to any well-read Indian by the early 1900s that India, as a concept, was doomed to extinction. **All said and done, India is a Hindu concept- created by Hindus, populated by Hindus, &amp; defined by Hindus.** Don't give me that 'secular' nonsense. Hinduism, like all Indo-European faiths, does not correlate morality with divinity, and thus shows a tolerance for other religions unknown to any faith currently existing on Earth (yes, even Buddhism)! Christians would've got by with their belief in a mythical Jerusalem. Muslims would've gone on praying to a Arab stone. But India is India! We are neither Israel or Arabia!\n\n**And thus was born Hindutva.** Racial pride- for a made-up race no one believed in. Cultural pride- for a non-existent culture in a land with millions. Civilizational pride- for a civilization that had long passed into legend &amp; fallen into barbarism. Religious pride- for a made-up religion that had to be carved out from the very forces it meant to oppose. \n\n&gt;*I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance*\n\n**What Savarkar being a Atheist- a real Atheist, unlike the anti-national conformist phonies of Quora &amp; the Indian Liberals- realized was that Hinduism was unlikely to survive for long- merely on account of being a pagan faith. And with Hinduism would've gone the very essence of India.** Think of it yourself. There are thousands of Dance traditions in India. How many of them are Islamic in origin? How many are Christian in origin? How many ragas have the Communists authored? What good have the hordes of the Indian media done for Humanity? After one thousand years, what good would a bunch of shouting news anchors have accomplished?\n\nAnd yet, we play the same raga Bhairavi the Emperor Samudragupta once played on his Veena a thousand years before the first ship sailed around Africa, the same raga Ustad Bismillah Khan performed every day on the ghats of Varanasi until a few years ago.\n\n**Thus Savarkar remade Hinduism.** From Christianity came the purpose &amp; violence of militaristic organization. From Islam, came the stress on ideological purity &amp; defensiveness. From Judaism came the emphasis on free enterprise &amp; racial-religious existence. The World's oldest religion was reforged in the very image of the newest- in order to withstand a new crueller, more ignorant Humanity. What he did was no different from what Ataturk did when he rebuilt a new Turkey form the ashes of the Ottoman Porte or when Mao took the most bitter, war-torn people of the World &amp; recast them into a united China.\n\nHe was a Nationalist. Everything he did was for the Nation. It is for posterity to judge his actions, not us- but to judge his intentions or his character? To be judged by intellectual pygmies who haven't had a single original thought of their own? **Veer Savarkar deserves better.**"<br />Author: 'KaliYuga-VaradA'  id: 'tfi6vf'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tfi6vf/why_did_veer_sawarkar_form_the_hindu_mahasabha_if/</li>

Most Indians dont have recreation activities at all. I live in US now, and many people have regular outdoor recreational hobbies and the ones who dont will at least go for a hike, swimming, tennis, golf sometimes.\n\nA lot of indians work 6 days a week, with minimal vacation days, and are simply exhausted. Most in their 30s have kids, family, in-laws drama etc taking away their time. Also, there are not too many avenues for such activities, because everything is so crowded. You cant go for a quick hike, you have to plan a whole thing with your family, who comes back home when, who has class etc etc. Even when there was a park right next to my house, we didnt go there that often. People in my society were just so beaten down by life i guess.\n\nSo what i observed is, indians spend their time, if at all available, sitting and talking with their friends, alcohol, prime time tv etc.\n\nI want to say that this has effect on our politics. They dont grow as people, they dont read books, they dont expand their circles, dont get to see new perspectives. Plus, having such small worldview makes you hateful of things, people you dont know. With no recreation, the work, family stress just festers in your mind, which manifests as hate.\n\nMaybe thats why people get so attached to stories like Rhea Chakraborty for months, which should have no impact really.

Your own daughter will bravely deny it, knowing that she will not be able to bear the guilt if something happens to you. Oh hey, Nikah Halala is legal according to our laws as well. Your daughter can get fucked by their entire family, while they quietly whisper threats to her parents in her ear. And if they decide to kill you anyway, Times of India will report "man stabbed in street over personal dispute", and the case will be forgotten. Cops can never enter their area without a full-blown riot, so they will just walk away. No FIR will be registered.\n\n**This is today. This is happening right this moment to someone**. Very few have gotten out of this alive, but their stories all have the same echoes. The rest end up headless bodies in suitcases, or forced sexual slaves, whose children will not even know you existed and will be indoctrinated to hate everything you stand for.\n\nYou keep worrying about "stagnation" and "the economy". I\'m sure there will be plenty of stagnation to look forward to - like the Dalits in Kashmir, who themselves, and **EVEN THEIR KIDS**, were ***FORBIDDEN from holding ANY OTHER JOB ASIDE FROM SANITATION WORKER***, otherwise they would immediately lose their Kashmir residency and their homes where they had been living forever. Sanitation workers children who had graduated college were forced to work ONLY in sanitation. This despicable atrocity was only ended after the removal of 35A and 370.\n\nBut once your state has its own "370", you can certainly look forward to all that economic wealth and prosperity... and watch it passing you by.\n\nYou can be assured of employment... as a toilet cleaner.\n\nKeep sleeping. No issue. Keep telling others who are fighting for YOU, to "stop being so communal yaar", "isse kya faida?"\n\nYou will have no lands, no children, no future, no wealth... but you will be very secular under Quwwat-ul-Islam.

Coming what triggered me the most was the fact that to this day, Media houses are downplaying what happened and political parties are blaming each other for not doing anything. Am I the only one, who thinks the politics in India is f\\*cked up and media houses are just shameless beyond reason?\n\nYesterday, I came across a clip of a debate held on Times Now where Anand Ranganathan gave an account of what happened during and after the events of January 19, 1990. To this, the congress spokesperson says the genocide of Kashmiris was a fault of their own. To top it all off, he justified the insurgency while putting the whole blame on the ruling party of BP Singh. I think the congress spokesperson forgot who was in the ruling government till 2014 and has been the biggest political party since the independence of India\n\nThis interview led me to dig more into events that took place around 19 January 1990. To my surprise, media houses like 'The Hindu' and 'Hindustan Times' are still trying to downplay or white-washed the events of genocide like nothing before! Not to mention the attempts to tag 'The Kashmir Files' as nothing more than a propaganda film. \n\nI mean we have documents including flyers that were printed and distributed by the militants to prove that the militants (We all know they were but, that's a topic for some other day. So, let's call them militants) have issued slogans like **Ralive, Tsalive, or Galive** (Convert to Islam, Leave the place or Perish) and acted on them as well. So many atrocities we committed against the Kashmiris like 24 individuals were lined up and shot in cold blood, people were sawed in half, the list goes on. This was a Genocide of Kashmiris who didn't fit the bill for the militants. While this was happening, Political party leaders were busy either ignoring the cries of the Kashmiris or playing the blame game.\n\nWhat is wrong with these people? How can they sleep at night while knowing the fact that they contributed to or covered up a genocide? \n\nPS: I was the one who posted a snap of the Hindustan Times article but took it down as I forgot to highlight the lines and messed up the title.

      <li>Title::: 'An observation from the kashmir files public review and our initiative'<br />Body: 'Hi All,  \n\n\nI\'ve been a longtime lurker of this sub. I have been watching multiple public reaction videos and I have observed a couple of things:  \n\n\n1. Youth is genuinely interested in knowing our history. So many of them lamented that the books did not tell them anything.\n2. There was a common undercurrent among the reviewers that "enough is enough" \n3. People are literally not shying away from calling out thing as is.\n4. Internet and social media are literally turning a comatose Hindu into an active and alert one.  \n\n\nOur Initiative:  \n\n\nMy friends and I are planning to create a parallel history syllabus (infographics, videos, short pdfs ) per grade. We are going to share the content for free ( here, wapp, quora, youtube (no monetization) ) so we can teach our children about Hindu history. We won\'t be creating any hate mongering or fear inducing material. It would be the same glory stories of our ancestors as that of Mughals and Turks in NCERT. \n\nWe are based out of Silicon valley and we have a technical prowess and money to make the best quality content provided we have the data/info. The idea stemmed from the discussion we had a couple of months ago. When one of my friends used the word "Jainism", her children thought she was talking about "zionism" as they had no idea what Jainism was! It dawned on us that our children literally knew nothing about our past. After that incident, we started an initiative of telling stories about our culture and they were genuinely interested in knowing more. The Kashmir files public reviews corroborated the same.   \n\n\nThe help we need from this sub : **We would be grateful if you can just share the name of any such legend from your region ( for example, you know a warrior/king/tribe that stood up against the atrocities and defended the dharma). We want to create a dynamic library of such personalities so that our people can learn about them.**   \n\n\nOur main motive: We want to replicate what Jews have replicated post WW2. They teach the children that these were the mistakes we did and the onus is on you to keep the flame burning. If even one out of thousands get the message then we will consider our ROI as 10000%.  \n\n\nThank you.'<br />Author: 'rmstart'  id: 'tedk64'<br />Score:177<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tedk64/an_observation_from_the_kashmir_files_public/</li>

May be few of us redditors can assume roles and act in the movie itself. \n\nIt might take some time or may be more but the exercise will give us a pathway to create "citizen movies". An such example can be used as a template to create further "citizen movies". And one fine day, we would have broken the back of bollywood.\n\nTelling that it is not feasible adds no additional information and provides no new direction than we already have now. But how to make it feasible will definitely provide some insight?\n\nWhat do you say?'<br />Author: 'blackrock-orange'  id: 'tdvaob'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tdvaob/viability_of_crowd_funding_a_new_movie_the_ajmer/</li>

I came across a post in this subreddit of a Pakistani Muslim converting and torturing a Hindu and what not. But seriously THAT IS NOT how you post it on foreign subreddits.  \nYour posts get deleted before reaching a 100 upvotes coz you gotta really show your hate for muslims in the fucking title. "pAkIsTaNi IsLaMiSt tOrtUrEs HiNdu giRl" Like bro wtf you were on reddit for so many years and did not learn that they do not like us and would rather stand for them. Why have you gotta make it so blatant, so obvious that your post gets removed under a minute of posting?  \nHear this:\n\ni) Appropriate title could be "Man tortures Minor girl from a minority".  \nPut subliminal translation in the comments subtly hinting that the girl may be a Hindu, and the man is trying to convert her.\n\n***Like how hard it is to not put a title that gets reported and attracts attention of mods?***\n\nii) OP of the post here should preferably not post in those subreddits, someone(preferably not an active participant or comment history in identifiable right wing subs) themselves shall take responsibility other than OP to download the video. OP should not be in it for Karma, rather to get our message across.\n\n# No crossposts. Download video and post.\n\niii) Attach plenty reliable sources and keep them ready before posting ANYTHING. You know the "where source" game is brutal in those subreddits.\n\niv) Try not to be a hateful bigot and approach the situation lightly. Again remember we are not hating on a particular group but highlighting our own plight. Post if you are civil and can conduct civil discussions. "Muslims christians bad bro" ain\'t gonna get you anywhere, you come as a hateful d\\*g\\*nerate, even to me.\n\nThat\'s all I can think for now, suggestions welcome.\n\nSorry for the crass lingua I have used, but y\'all ducking r\\*t\\*rd\\*d so had too.'<br />Author: 'vampir3dud3_'  id: 'tdtfor'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tdtfor/your_bible_for_posting_to_other_subreddits/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I nearly got scammed by guys pretending from the Army'<br />Body: ' Hi, everyone I nearly got scammed by people pretending from the Army, and is post is more of awareness post/ rant post for it. So anyway I run a nursery and landscaping business in Siliguri, and last night a call from a guy saying that he was from the nearby army transit camp. He placed an order for 200 plants, worth Rs. 18500, so far so good. Anyway when I went there with the plants this morning with the plants, he gave his phone to his “Senior Officer” and that guy asked me how much money I had in my bank account. This was the first sign of trouble, I just gave him a random no. Rs. 3521 and then he sent an QR code which said I have to pay him Rs. 3000. This sent my alarm bells ringing, please note that he was continuously in call with me. \n\nI said “Sir why are you asking me to pay?”\n\nHe said “It is an Army QR code, just to check if you have an account or not”\n\nHe quickly sent me another QR code and told him to send Rs 1 in it. Now please note that I am giving him the benefit of doubt, I have dealt with people who are not tech savvy and kinda don’t understand procedure. So I sent him Rs. 1.\n\nNow the first guy comes in the call and tries to reassure me that this is the proper process and he was busy getting the gate pass issued for my entrance, and I needed to clear the payment before issuing the gate pass. Also the first guy sent Rs. 2 to my account. \n\nI said “Sir, I am getting trouble in internet, you can just pay me in cash or cheque. Also can you please come out to check the plants? I am at the entrance of the army camp”\n\nHe said “No I cannot come out I am busy issuing the gate pass. Clear the payment through QR code, we don’t issue cash or cheque”\n\nNote that, by this time I already know it’s a scam. I have supplied to the Indian Army and SSB before, and have garden maintenance contracts with NHPC, NRL and couple of other private companies so I have an idea about their payment method. No company or organization issues payment through QR code. But I am pretending to see how far he will go.\n\nI said “Then can you atleast send a Jawan to check the plants and give physical confirmation?”\n\nHe said “Are you the PM or what? That a jawan will go to receive you? Just do the payment and I will issue the gate pass”\n\nAnd he sent me another QR code which said I must pay the guy Rs. 2000.\n\nAnyway I continued it for a bit and when he started using abusive language, and I ended the call.\n\nSo well here is the experience about how I nearly got scammed, I am attaching the screenshot of   their UPI id just if someone whats to know.

On graduation, I joined a company and he took over his father's business. We were and are still in touch. Often played multiplayer games together and were having a fun time.\n\nAfter a while, I decided it was time to be a bit more career focussed and it is when I decided I should persue higher studies. And just when I joined a University, my friend decided to get married and for some reasons, I had to miss his wedding which I deeply regret. But I promised him that I will meet him and his wife after I get free from all this mess I am into right now.\n\nAnd after when he got married, we were talking less as he was occupied with his family and business. \n\n==========\n\nThree years later, it's time for me to fulfill the promise I made to him. I will soon be meeting him and his wife. I have only seen a photo of his wife at the time when they were about to be married which he shared with me and have no idea what her interests are.\n\nWhat should I be gifting her wife that she won't dislike it at the very least? (There's a saying that one needs to keep man happy and his wife even happier if you want to stay friends with him. :p )  \nI don't have a girlfriend or any close girl friend of her age that I can ask for opinions.\n\nSo, **can someone, especially women or people who are already married, on Reddit suggest me what I should be gifting his wife?**\n\nPS: Already decided what I will be gifting to this friend of mine, asking for gift suggestions for his wife. Also please note that the gift needs to be really good as it is apology(for missing their wedding) and congratulatory gift(as congratulations on their wedding).\n\n==========\n\nTL;DR: Suggest me a good present for my best friend's wife as an apology and congratulatory present as I missed their wedding and meeting them around 3 years later."<br />Author: 'pkludakgaya'  id: 'tds75m'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tds75m/i_m27_am_meeting_bestfriend_m26_of_mine_after_3/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Relations between the UAE and India are entering a new era.'<br />Body: "The United Arab Emirates and India have significant bilateral relationships based on long-standing religious, cultural, and economic ties. Under the leadership of the UAE and India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, ties are reaching new heights. The groundwork for more powerful and promising cooperation between India and the UAE has been built by mutually strengthening economic aspirations and attuned geopolitical outlooks. The landmark CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) between the UAE and India is a forerunner to future economic collaboration between the two countries and a huge boost to bilateral relations. One of CEPA's main goals is to increase bilateral non-oil merchandise trade to USD 100 billion in the next five years.\n\nThe CEPA will make bilateral investments in labor-intensive industries such as textiles, gems and jewelry, leather goods, and food processing easier. Similar commercial deals between India and other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries will be made easier as a result of the accord. Furthermore, under CEPA, about 90% of export products and 80% of trade lines between India and the UAE will be duty-free. Over the next 5-10 years, India's zero-duty access to the UAE is predicted to increase to 97 percent of UAE tariff lines or 99 percent of Indian exports by value.\n\nSource: [https://www.indiatoday.in/impact-feature/story/uae-india-relations-dawn-of-a-new-era-1924091-2022-03-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/impact-feature/story/uae-india-relations-dawn-of-a-new-era-1924091-2022-03-11)"<br />Author: 'yourfairymonzter'  id: 'tds3ys'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tds3ys/relations_between_the_uae_and_india_are_entering/</li>
