      <li>Title::: 'Why does Indian society pressure women to cover up?'<br />Body: "I think the answer to this question is biological.\n\nMy suspicion is that **communities in hotter climates have high dopamine levels, and the opposite for communities in colder climates.** This explains why Indians for example are more expressive and emotional than the Chinese. This also has tremendous influence on how men (and women) react to stimulation, in particular sexual stimulation.\n\nUsing the India-China example, a woman in China can walk in the street wearing tights that looks like panties and no one bats an eye. If a woman does that even in the most modern and wealthy neighborhoods of India, even the women will give her stares.\n\nI think the reason is because the average East Asian man (and woman) are hardwired to respond less to sexual stimulation. Looking at a woman in microtights on the street doesn't give that much of an arousal. In contrast, most South Asian men cannot help but get over-stimulated. Perhaps the same can be said of Middle Eastern men, which is why they too have developed a culture that requires women to cover up, in fact a lot worse."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'htv69v'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/htv69v/why_does_indian_society_pressure_women_to_cover_up/</li>

Also, they were making fun of Hindus (using Hind*s) saying they still kill us. They are thinking that Sikhs are being made scapegoats by the army in their fight against the Chinese.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Sikh Community (including me) are genuinely angry that justice is still being delayed to the victims of 1984 Genocide. Also, there are many issues stemming from 1980\'s that haven\'t been solved. Succeeding Govt\'s didn\'t do enough but the diaspora Sikh community has clearly become anti-India. They will not even hesitate and make fun of Indian Sikhs opposing their calls for Khalistan.\n\nThey don\'t realise that all religions in Punjab are finally trying to live in peace.

      <li>Title::: 'How "history" was written in Bharat over the last 1200 years'<br />Body: 'Mughal invaders had a certain method of writing history. They would first destroy everything that existed before Islam. Then they would manufacture "history" and continually push their accepted version in the darbars, religious institutions, and history books.\n\nMohammad Bin Qasim invaded Sindh because Sindhi pirates attacked an Arab ship returning from Sri Lanka, and it had some noble women. And so they sent him to conquer Sindh and convert everyone to Islam or kill, but no one knows what happened to the pirates or the women.\nAurangzeb hanged Guru Tegh Bahadur because the Guru and his followers were torturing Kashmiri Pandits. Reality was that Guruji went to Aurangzeb to request protection for the Pandits from Muslim violence, and Aurangzeb hanged him because he refused to convert to Islam.\nThe Moplas of Kerala massacred 2000 Hindu landlords because the landlords were colluding with the British to suppress the Khilafat movement. Reality was that they wanted to take over the temples, land and houses, and the police was brought in to stop a genocide. The Kerala government now teaches the history of the "Mopla revolution" where the Muslims bravely resisted British oppression of the Khilafat movement, and died in hundreds doing so.\nThe Kashmiri Pandits weren\'t forced to leave by Muslims. The governor Shri Jagmohan made them leave so the Bharat Sena would have a free hand to brutalize the Muslims. We know what actually happened without any doubt in this one because it\'s recent history.\nThe Taliban destroyed the Bamian Buddhas because the foreigners were willing to pay and restore the statues, but not to feed hungry children, and that\'s a sin in Islam. The foreign trusts actually offered to even buy the statues and the Afghans could have used the money to feed hungry children, but the Taliban didn\'t respond to queries about this.\nTablighi Jamat didn\'t violate Coronavirus lockdown rules or try to spread the virus. The PM announced the lockdown very suddenly, and most people were stuck in the Masjid and surrounding areas. Never mind that this happened in multiple locations in India and people who were local to the area were involved, and they did it in many other countries including Pakistan and Malaysia.\nThe British, on the other hand, used subterfuge. Hiding the original texts, mistranslating in English on purpose, making our native languages inaccessible to us by shutting down Gurukuls and educating us solely in English, while telling us how backward we are, and fit only to become clerks.\n\nTake that in for a second. The British wanted to ensure our backwardness, so they deny us our languages (which had far superior bodies of thought and culture) and gave us English to bring us down to their level of intellectual bankruptcy and moral depravity.\n\nThe Congress was ruled by people who went to England to study (Gandhi, Nehru and others), and prior to their political careers, they had become enamoured by the lifestyle and democracy the British had. They decided we had to become as western as possible to rid ourselves of this backwardness. That\'s why they have an inherent anti-Hindu bias to this day, as they\'re led by people like RG and MMS who studied in the west. And of course, they stuck to the Mughal and British narrative of Bharat\'s history, and continued down the same path while writing about the independence struggle, partition, riots, and border skirmishes.\n\nThe BJP leaders have all without exception been Hindi, Sindhi, Gujarati, Marathi, and Kannada medium educated.

People from these universities are brought for debate, discussions and literature festivals to help people understand the Indian view or Indian narrative to the world but instead they try to malign india for being poor, patriarchy and fascist society. These people function because of the indian taxpayers money and still spew venom against India that too on an international platforms that go unnoticed. \n\nIs India such low on human capital that only JNU is considered a place for intellectual minds. Is english the only factor of deciding intellectualism in this country. If Indians have to grow and show their vision of society many universities need to be set up in support of Hindu identity/ Indic cause. The communists of JNU will always portray a distorted picture of India and Hinduism if it is not countered at right time. \n\nIn my opinion the Banaras Hindu University must be nurtured as a pro Indian and pro Hindu university in India. An intellectual force that is pro Indian and also has a sense of cultural identity in this soil must be appreciated and brought forward by the government. Banaras - Kashi is considered to be a place of great knowledge and also one of the most ancient cities of the world.

      <li>Title::: "Issues with center-right's tele messaging"<br />Body: "After observing the way prime time news is served on a majority of our news channels, despite these channels being pro center-right ideas, they are doing more harm than good. Any good point they might raise ends up being discredited as propaganda piece or as news from a substandard news channel. Debates akin to Arnab's, despite him being a staunch patriot are doing more harm since the number of people who discredit his news and him for acting like a buffoon is growing \n\nSolutions:  \n1. Invest massively on having an online presence like Scroll, Quint, The Wire.  \n2. Execute deep investigative efforts inside states ruled by center-left parties.  \n3. Give up the prime time debate( tu-tu mai-mai), and bring on experts on the subject rather than party representative and not have more that 2  guests.  \n4. Eliminate all tacky graphics and transitions such as fire animation during prime time debate etc. Make it professional, calm and highly informative.  \n5. Focus on the centrists, swinging them wins or breaks elections. Present politically neutral analysis and slowly turn the boil by including slightly polarized spin on the news but never exceeding to the level of looking like a propaganda channel like they do now.  \n6. Become the CNN for the airports, be the news channel that is played at airports and lounges and hotels. For that point 4 needs to be followed.  \n7. Talk to the audience, dont have the posture of preaching. The news anchor ought to talk to me on their show as if we are having a conversation in the same room not as if they are giving sermons."<br />Author: 'Reduce-Stimulation'  id: 'hssxzn'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hssxzn/issues_with_centerrights_tele_messaging/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Coming collapse of India and Raspail'<br />Body: " \n\nAs we all know, our glorious third world country is teetering on the verge of collapse with extensive deregulation ,environmental degradation and the annual fixtures of climate change. That is not taking into account the youth bulge in an era where jobs wont easily be found due to ai,automation as well as outsource to cheaper places which themselves are verging on collapse. So , I started searching for books that deals with this issue. One famous book which i found was Jean Raspail, The Camp of the Saints.\n\nIt deals with a scenario of a horde of Indian migrants/refugees swarming europe and Europe unable to shoot them or bomb them because of humanitarian grounds. Seeing the situation in Syria and reading the stats, I see similar parallels here in India . There is water crisis here, climate change , the threat off nuclear war, unstable demographics, unplanned urbanization , a leadership forced to resort to extremism due to populist tactics to stay in power as well as mass unemployment. The netflix series Leila which is basically an extrapolated take on modern India beautifully captures it\n\nNow the interesting part is a few million arab refugees who are basically white and can 'pass' as white have bought this humanitarian sentiment to its knees. Right now, they are literally shooting people in greco turkish border. But Indians wont have this luxury since most of us stand like sore thumb as tar on milk.\n\nSeeing hordes of Indians who flee the coming war or other crises exasperated by migration to cities would mean most will not even be remotely sympathetic to their plight. Already thousands in Punjab are risking lives and money crossing the Darien Gap on false grounds of asylum. It is only a matter of time before this process speeds up dramatically and hordes descend on the west. This horde , like Syria will not be the most marginalised , nor the poorest but better educated people with the financial means to travel like you and me.\n\nSo, I want to know what you guys think of the coming crises?(and please dont delete this. I genuinely want to know what you guys think? I have seen educated english syrian refugees on reddit writing /exhorting westerners to accept refugees. On inspection or inquiry i ask what ultimate right they have and basically all they can do is beg and to rely on the mercy of foreigners , they are silent since there is no response to this argument. But the people hopping fences dont really think of this fact. Being invaders of foreign homes they see themselves as persecuted.)\n\nI will link an article on Raspail -\n\n[https://peakoilbarrel.com/special-thread-the-camp-of-the-saints/](https://peakoilbarrel.com/special-thread-the-camp-of-the-saints/)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/books/jean-raspail-author-white-supremacists.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/books/jean-raspail-author-white-supremacists.html)"<br />Author: 'SadThirdWorlder'  id: 'hsrs8p'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hsrs8p/coming_collapse_of_india_and_raspail/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Political System and Cancel Culture'<br />Body: 'People often take gross generalisations about the US\'s political system and try to apply them to India\'s political system. Despite this, there is an emerging consensus among both Left and Right that our political system is not the same as the one in the United States of America. Though one thing we all often ignore in this is the consequences of people trying to apply American political instruments to India\'s political landscape. I believe this is something we have to discuss more since the attributes of the political instruments used remain the same as America the way things develop is entirely unique. I will be elaborating on one such instrument which we know as "Cancel movement" and its effect on India.\n\nNow "Cancel movement" in simple terms is the act of drumming up opposition to ventures or people whose political opinions/statements etc the movement disagrees with an aim to either remove the venture or people economically or opportunity wise. Now I will not be going into the morality of using such an instrument to assert political will because it would be a pointless discussion. It is an effective instrument and in front of power no matter what your ideology is you will use it just because of the fact that the otherside will also use it given the chance. It\'s the same logic as using weapons in a war, doesn\'t matter if you morally disagree you would need to cultivate the capability to defend yourself effectively. Instead, I am going to focus on the cons of this approach.\n\n1. Individuals don\'t have any conscious control over what gets taken up as the cause instead it gets controlled by a loud minority. It can be the right issue to be taken up, it can be wrong or it could even be a misunderstanding. But the ones who are vocal instead of ones who are responsible and aware gets to control the direction.\n\n2. Use it too many times you risk fracturing the movement itself. Any dissent is met with zero tolerance, the overarching philosophy is either you are with us or against us. When that is done there is a stop to cooperation and the movement itself collapses under its weight resulting in the other side taking advantage of it. The USA\'s left is the prime example of this and the Right is having a field day taking advantage of it.\n\n3. It results in social instability resulting in a rift in individuals due to political opinions. Promotes social paranoia, people seeing perceived slights in anything and everything.\n\n4. It makes it easier for vested interests to control the movements. Take twitter for example in light of the recent revelation of an Admin Tool through which it is possible to spring up artificial trends do you think Twitter doesn\'t use this to promote enimity on their platform among different ideological groups? We all know Twitter thrives on hate and lack of political discussions. And the more discussion it trumps up more advertisement money gets poured in. At this point I am not even sure how much of the political rift in demoracies is the result of Twitter acting in bad faith.\n\nUnlike the US where the left has the virtual hegemony on this tactic, in India both Left and Right have used this tactic quite successfully so any one of them or both them could collapse due to overuse of this tactic. But from a general glance it looks like the left is united in opposing the Right\'s rise in India so the possibility of them collapsing is highly unlikely.'<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'hsqw0w'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hsqw0w/indian_political_system_and_cancel_culture/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Nehru\'s Cronies Tried To "Fix" FM Sam Manekshaw By Attempting To Get Him Sacked'<br />Body: 'From: [http://www.sunday-guardian.com/investigation/krishna-menon-wanted-to-sack-manekshaw](http://www.sunday-guardian.com/investigation/krishna-menon-wanted-to-sack-manekshaw)\n\nField Marshal Sam Manekshaw\'s career was almost written off as a major general after he rebuffed Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Menon\'s attempt to rope him in a bid to isolate the then Indian Army Chief, General K.S. Thimayya, with whom the Defence Minister openly had differences.\n\nA new biography on Manekshaw by his long-serving military aide, Brigadier (Retd) Behram Panthaki and his wife Zenobia, brings out graphically how Manekshaw refused to be disloyal to his chief, and stood up to Menon, who then tried to fix him on frivolous grounds.\n\nTitled *Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, The Man and His Times*, the biography also discloses how a furious Sardar Patel hustled a reluctant Jawaharlal Nehru into sending the Army to Kashmir and saved the valley from Pakistani raiders in 1947. Nehru, according to this version, wanted to consult with the UN before sending in troops, even after the Maharaja of Kashmir had signed the Instrument of Accession to India.\n\nMenon, widely considered responsible for pushing India to its military defeat at the hands of China in 1962, had sought to undermine General Thimayya, after he cautioned the Nehru government against the Menon line of military adventurism against China without adequate preparation. Thimayya offered to resign, but was persuaded by Nehru to stay on. But this did not deter Menon from attempting to subvert Thimayya. The Manekshaw biography paints a grim picture of the Defence Minister trying to create divisions within the Army in the run up to the 1962 War, and even canvassing directly with generals against the Army Chief.\n\nIn a first, detailed account of the sparring between Menon and Manekshaw, then a major general commanding 26 Division on the Ceasefire Line in the Jammu region, the biographers suggest that Menon sought to probe Manekshaw during a visit to his formation by seeking his opinion on the then Army Chief. "***Mr Minister, I am not allowed to think about him. He is my Chief. Tomorrow, you will be asking my (subordinate) brigadiers and colonels what they think of me. It\'s the surest way to ruin the discipline of the Army. Don\'t do it in future***," responded Manekshaw.\n\nMenon flew into a rage and told Manekshaw to "abandon his British ways of thinking", and declared that "I can get rid of Thimayya if I want to!" Undeterred, Manekshaw acknowledged that the Defence Minister could indeed sack the Chief, but that would still not shake his resolve not to comment on the next appointee as well. Manekshaw, whose centenary was observed at a low-key function at Delhi Cantonment on 3 April, also refused to carry out Menon\'s orders to use soldiers as labourers for constructing deficit accommodation. He insisted that soldiers under his command would only train to fight the enemy and not be used as cheap labour.\n\n**A scorned Menon turned hostile to Manekshaw, and teamed up with the then Major General B.M. Kaul, to fix him by cooking up evidence to back up frivolous charges**. A court of inquiry was ordered against Manekshaw on allegations of being an "unabashed Anglophile", too Western and, by implication, anti-Indian, of restoring and putting up in his office portraits of Robert Clive and Warren Hastings, and insulting Shivaji by saying (allegedly) that the painting of Shivaji riding a stallion was misleading because Shivaji only rode *taattoos* (ponies).Image 2nd\n\nIn a foreword to the biography, Manekshaw\'s contemporary, Lt General S.K. Sinha recounts the sordid attempts by the Menon-Kaul duo to cook up evidence against Manekshaw. Sinha was then, briefly, at the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, where Manekshaw was the Commandant. A colonel was sent by Kaul from Army Headquarters to get instructors at the Staff College to depose against Manekshaw. This colonel was staying not at an Army mess but, strangely, at a hotel in Coonoor. Sinha too was summoned to this hotel. "When I entered the colonel\'s room, I found two Army instructors from the Staff College briefing the Colonel and insinuating that Sam had been indulging in \'anti-national\' activities....The Colonel asked me to give similar evidence but I refused since I was not witness to any anti-national activity by Sam. The colonel was outraged and threatened to call General Kaul... I walked out of the hotel," recounts Sinha.\n\nThe charges were dismissed by a court of inquiry by the Western Army Commander, Lt General Daulet Singh, but Menon did not relent in his effort to get Manekshaw dismissed. He wrote a letter of severe displeasure and had it put on Manekshaw\'s service record. Kaul comes out as an inept General jealous of Manekshaw, who was a threat to his aspiration to become Army Chief.\n\nManekshaw\'s career survived this vicious assault after both Krishna Menon and Kaul met their nemesis in the 1962 War.\n\nThe biography also has a revealing account of Nehru\'s indecision on Kashmir, even as Pakistani raiders were within 7 km of the Srinagar airport on 26 October 1947, and Sardar Patel prevailing upon Nehru. Manekshaw, then a Lt Colonel in the Directorate of Military Operations, presented an assessment to the Defence Committee of the Cabinet that Kashmir would be lost for good if troops were not flown immediately.\n\n"Nehru hesitated (even after the Maharaja of Kashmir acceded to India). He was concerned about the world opinion and talked about consulting the UN until an impatient Sardar wrested the initiative from him. "Jawahar, do you want Kashmir or do you want to give it away?" "Of course, I want Kashmir," was Nehru\'s indignant response. The Sardar turned to Sam and said, "You have your marching orders".\n\n"At 11 am from Delhi\'s Safdarjung airport with six IAF and fifty Dakotas requisitioned a few days earlier from private airlines. A total of 800 sorties were flown for a fortnight. By 16 November the raiders had been repulsed from the valley and Srinagar and the airport were secured although engagement with infiltrators in the rest of Kashmir and along the border continued for another 14 months," the book states.'<br />Author: 'JainPork'  id: 'hsqezl'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hsqezl/nehrus_cronies_tried_to_fix_fm_sam_manekshaw_by/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Nehru Let Tibet Fall And Insulted FM Cariappa When The Field Marshal Pointed Out The Chinese Threat In 1948'<br />Body: 'From: [http://www.indiandefencereview.com/spotlights/indian-army-the-blunted-sword/2/](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/spotlights/indian-army-the-blunted-sword/2/)\n\nThe vast tableland of Tibet abuts the Himalayan wall for most of its length. With bases in Tibet, a detemined enemy can infiltrate into India through the Himalayan passes. For ages Tibet had been a friendly neighbour with whom India had cultural and trade relations. During the British regime, the Indian Government had acquired special interests in Tibet. It ran Tibet‚Äôs postal and telegraph services besides running a mission at Lhasa, military posts at Gyantse and Yatung and several rest-houses on the Kalimpong-Lhasa road. Pilgrims and traders could travel freely between the two countries.\n\nWith China too, India‚Äôs relations had been good. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang leader, was on friendly terms with leaders of the Indian National Congress and had paid a visit to India during the Second World War. However, when the People‚Äôs Republic of China was inaugurated, the Indian Government was quick to grasp the realities of the situation and India was one of the first countries to recognize the new regime. The invasion of Tibet, therefore, came as a rude shock to the Indian Government. Chinese maps, which had till then been a minor irritant, now assumed a sinister significance. A protest note to Peking had no effect and was virtually rejected.\n\nA dispassionate appraisal of the Indian Government‚Äôs policy towards China after the latter‚Äôs entry into Tibet shows a duality. The threat to India‚Äôs security was obvious. However, while fears and reservations were expressed in private, a facade of brotherly friendliness was outwardly maintained in the hope that this tactic would not unnecessarily provoke the Chinese, who had already humbled the mighty USA in Korea. In his book Witness to an Era, Frank Moraes has stated that when India sent the first cultural delegation to China in 1952, it was led by Prime Minister Nehru‚Äôs sister, Mrs V.L. Pandit. Moraes was also a member of the delegation and Nehru briefed it in detail:\n\n*‚ÄúNever forget that the basic challenge in South-East Asia is between India and China. That challenge runs along the spine of Asia. Therefore, in your talks with the Chinese keep it in mind. Never let the Chinese patronize you‚Äù.*\n\nB.N. Mullik, Director of Intelligence during this period, is more specific. \n\nHe says:\n\n‚ÄúWhen in 1952, in the early stages of our advent into the field of foreign intelligence we had asked his \\[Nehru‚Äôs\\] advice about our targets, he had clearly visualized that the two enemies whom India would have to confront would be Pakistan, which would utilize Pan-Islamism in its support, and China, which would use international communism for its ends, and had fixed these to be our main targets in the foreign field. . . . He counselled us not to be led away by the open professions of the Government in these matters, but to judge everything in India‚Äôs interests and seek his advice whenever there was conflict‚Äù.\n\nThe Chinese too played the same game but did it more astutely. While acting the big brother, they prepared themselves militarily for the attainment of their national aims. The Chinese leadership had a grand design: the establishment of China‚Äôs hegemony over South-East Asia, so as to fill the power vacuum created by the British withdrawal. They went about their task with thoroughness and made each move at the time of their choosing, while allaying India‚Äôs apprehensions. For example, in September 1951, the Chinese Premier, Chou En-lai, told India‚Äôs ambassador that China intended in every way to safeguard India‚Äôs interests in Tibet and that ‚Äòthere was no territorial dispute or controversy between India and China‚Äô.11\n\nIn September 1952, the two Governments signed an agreement regarding retention of the Indian Mission at Lhasa, which was converted into a Consulate General. In return, the Indian Government agreed to the opening of the Chinese Consulate General at Bombay. But conditions had changed in Tibet after the Chinese occupation and the agreement did not bring much relief to scholars, pilgrims and traders who attempted, according to the time-honoured custom, to enter Tibet. They suffered many frustrations.\n\nAfter lengthy discussions, another pact called an Agreement for Trade and Cultural Intercourse was signed between India and China on 29 April 1954. The Panchsheel, or the Five Principles,12 which was to govern future relations between the two countries, formed the preamble to this agreement. Some time before the negotiations began, the Indian Government gave wide publicity to its intention to relinquish its extra-territorial rights in Tibet inherited from the British regime. A day after the agreement was signed, it made a gift of its postal, telegraph, telephone and rest-house facilities to China.\n\nIn China as well as India, the agreement was hailed as a great step towards peaceful co-existence. Panchsheel was acclaimed as an ideal basis for relationship between nations and Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai became a popular slogan. Surprisingly, the Indian Government made no effort to settle the question of Chinese maps during the negotiations preceding the agreement. In return for all that India surrendered to the Chinese, they could have been brought round to making a declaration in this regard, accepting existing treaties and customary borders. The Indian leadership missed this opportunity. On the other hand, the Indian Government went out of its way to appease the Chinese. During the British regime, the Government of India had recognized only the suzerainty of China over Tibet. The new agreement referred to Tibet as a ‚Äòregion of China‚Äô.\n\nThe boundary issue did, however, come up for discussion at the negotiations. This was in respect of Himalayan passes on the Uttar Pradesh-Tibet border. After some discussions, both sides agreed to incorporate the following words in the agreement: ‚ÄòTraders and pilgrims of both countries may travel through the following passes. . . (1) Shipki Pass, (2) Mana Pass, (3) Niti Pass, (4) Kungribingri Pass, (5) Darma Pass and (6) Lipu Lekh Pass‚Äô. This was taken to be an indirect recognition that these were border passes.\n\nStrangely, it was in this sector that the first border dispute arose. Bara Hoti is a small trading post, a few kilometres South of the Niti Pass. On 17 July 1954, the Chinese Government sent a protest note to India regarding the presence of Indian troops at Bara Hoti. When talks on this question began, the Chinese persisted in claiming that this place lay North of the pass. Despite Panchsheel this dispute never came to be settled.\n\nThe agreement was not fulfilled in respect of the trade agency at Gartok. Difficulties were always put in the way and no permanent agency was ever established there. The Indian consulate at Kashgar was obliged to close down after the Chinese Government moved to exclude all foreign interests from Sinkiang.\n\nWhat were the Indian Army‚Äôs reactions to the events in Tibet? Retired civilian officials who held important posts in the post-Independence period have, in their writings, blamed the Army leadership for the happenings of 1962. S.S. Khera, who was the Cabinet Secretary during the crucial years, has said:\n\n‚ÄúThe Army Chiefs did not appear to have become alive early enough to the threat from the North. Their whole training and mental make-up seemed to shun the possibility of a campaign along the Himalayan heights and on the Tibet border. . . . The Army Chiefs did not consider it a feasible proposition at all even to envisage an armed conflict with the Chinese. They seemed unable to escape the conditioning they had had under the British regime in India. . . . Inhibited in this way, not unnaturally, the Army Chiefs were reluctant to extend their activities to meet the threat across Tibet‚Äù.13\n\nWhy did the Service Chiefs not oppose all this?\n\nThese are very serious charges. If true, they would condemn the Army Chiefs of the time in the eyes of posterity. Fortunately, they are not true and it is most surprising that a senior official of the Government should make such sweeping statements, which bear no relationship to facts. The reality was entirely different.\n\nFirst, the British were well aware of the danger from the North. That was why they sent a military expedition to Tibet in 1904 and made it a buffer state, although, at that time, the danger was not from China, but from Czarist Russia. The Defence Services Staff College at Wellington is an institution where middle-rank officers of the three Services learn the mechanics of war. At the time of the Chinese invasion of Tibet a distinguished British soldier, Major General Lentaigne, was the Commandant of the Staff College. Brigadier Dalvi, who was a student at the College, recalls Lentaigne‚Äôs reaction when the news of the invasion came through. He was so perturbed that he walked into the main hall, interrupted the lecturer and proceeded to denounce our leaders for their shortsightedness and inaction, in the face of the Chinese action. Speaking purely as a soldier and a strategist, he said that India‚Äôs back-door had been opened and the Himalayas had become the boundary with a large, powerful and expansionist China. He dwelt on the vulnerability of our Eastern regions due to the concentration of industry and sources of raw materials and said that these would be within range of bombers operating from bases in Tibet.14\n\nAccording to Dalvi, some weeks after this incident a very senior official‚Äô of the External Affairs Ministry came to give the students of the Staff College a talk on Sino-Tibetan relations. He tried to ‚Äòjustify the \\[Government‚Äôs\\] policy of allowing China to subjugate Tibet‚Äô.\n\nI asked General Cariappa in 1979 as to what his reaction was to the Chinese occupation of Tibet; he was, after all, the Army Chief at the time. He stated that after partition Indian troops were withdrawn from the Eastern frontier area and all airfields and Army camps were closed down. The Assam Rifles, who were at that time under the Government of Assam, were responsible for the security of this area. Early in January1951, Cariappa received an urgent message from the Assam Government that large bodies of Chinese troops were operating around Rima, a place North of Walong in the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) and was asked if the Army could do something to stop any threat to Indian territory. The only thing that Cariappa could think of was to drop some paratroopers in the threatened area. The drop consisted of two officers and a platoon of men, including one officer and two men from the Engineers. Three Dakotas flew the party to the dropping zone near Walong and, after operating for about three weeks in the area, the paratroopers trekked back to Sadiya.\n\nThe parachute action had its effect and the threat of Chinese intrusion into Indian territory was removed for the time being. However, taking a long-term view of Chinese presence on the Northern borders, Cariappa appreciated that they might create trouble on the McMahon Line, the boundary between NEFA and Tibet. He felt that the remedy was to place NEFA and the Assam Rifles under the Army for the purpose of defence. His intention was to stabilize the McMahon Line in the same way as the British had done in the case of the Durand Line on the North-West Frontier. He wanted to establish posts all along the boundary and garrison them with the Assam Rifles. At the same time, he wanted to open up the wartime airfields, roads and military camps right up to the Chinese border. Accordingly, he took the matter to the Defence Minister, who told him to discuss it with the Prime Minister.The next day, Cariappa was called up by Pandit Nehru. Major General Daulat Singh was then officiating as Chief of the General Staff. Cariappa took him along. Cariappa outlined his plan for NEFA to the Prime Minister. Having listened to him, Nehru asked for the reason for all these measures. When Cariappa mentioned that the Chinese might have designs against this region, Nehru flared up, thumped hard on the table and said: ‚ÄúIt is not the business of the Commander-in-Chief to tell the Prime Minister who is going to attack us where. In fact the Chinese will defend our Eastern frontier. You mind only Kashmir and Pakistan‚Äù. Cariappa walked out of the Prime Minister‚Äôs office, very disappointed.\n\nPrime Minister Nehru could brush aside the Army Chief‚Äôs advice. But there was a man in his Government whose advice he could not ignore. He was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Deputy Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he died in December 1950. Had Patel lived a few more years, India might have been spared the ignominy of 1962. A month before his death, on 7 November 1950, he wrote a long letter to Nehru, giving a masterly exposition of the threat that India faced on account of Tibet‚Äôs invasion and recommended certain measures to meet it. He said that the attitude of the Chinese Government was unfriendly and its policy expansionist. He further said that the invasion of Tibet would bring the Chinese Army to the gates of India and throw into the melting pot all past frontier settlements with Tibet. He pointed out that the Himalayan passes offered several ingress routes and that the population in most of the border regions bore affinity to the Tibetans ‚Äì factors which the Chinese would exploit to achieve their ambitions.\n\nIn his advice to the Prime Minister, he stressed the following:\n\n1. Urgent need to formulate a defence strategy.\n2. Appraisal of the strength of the armed forces and, if necessary, reconsideration of the retrenchment plans for the Army.\n3. Long-term co-ordination of defence needs, such as an assured supply of arms, ammunition and equipment.\n4. Improvement of communications in the border regions, including rail, road, air and radio.\n5. Policing of border posts, and building of an intelligence network in the threatened regions.15\n\nAccording to Mullik (My Years with Nehru ‚Äì The Chinese Betrayal), Patel‚Äôs letter was circulated to the ministries concerned. Later, a small committee was formed to visit NEFA and recommend places near the frontier where the Assam Rifles would be deployed. At the same time, another committee was formed under the chairmanship of Major General Himmatsinghji, Deputy Minister for Defence. It had representatives from the Army,16 the Air Force, the Ministries of Home, External Affairs and Communications and from the Intelligence Bureau. The Government also sanctioned the Indo-Tibet Border Force for manning the checkposts on the frontier less the Norh-East.\n\nThe Himmatsinghji Committee submitted its recommendations in two parts: on the Sikkim, Bhutan, NEFA and Burma border in April 1951, and on the Ladakh, Himachal, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh border in September that year. The committee‚Äôs recommendations included the reorganization and redeployment of the military forces in the area, some increase in the infantry and supponing arms, the development of certain airfields and the setting up of a radar network on the Eastern frontier. The committee also recommended considerable increase in the Assam Rifles and other armed police units for larger concentrations at vulnerable points, from which effective patrolling could be regularly undertaken. So far as intelligence was concerned, it recommended the abolition of the military intelligence organization in the field and its amalgamation with the Intelligence Bureau, the reorganization of the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureaus at Calcutta and Shillong and the formation of an Intelligence Corps. The Committee also recommended the extension of civil administration into the interior of tribal areas along the borders and the establishment of a cadre of Frontier Service officers.\n\nThe Committee brought to light grave shortcomings in the security of India‚Äôs borders and in the administration of regions that lay close to them. According to Mullik, the Cabinet accepted all its recommendations and told the departments concered to implement them. This was where the hitch came.\n\nMany factors affected the implementation: paucity of funds, difficult terrain and the absence of a sense of urgency. The last factor was the main reason for the state of unpreparedness in 1962. This is evident from the fact that the Border Roads Organization was set up only in 1960, nine years after the committee had sent in its recommendations, though the building of roads in the strategic regions should have received top priority. In the early fifties, NEFA and Aksai Chin must have seemed far away to those sitting in New Delhi.\n\nThe net result of the labours of the Committee, in so far as the immediate future was concerned, was an increase in the strength of the Assam Rifles, besides the growth in the importance of the Intelligence Bureau. A beginning was also made towards the extension of civil administration in NEFA, but nothing tangible was done for preparing the Army for the\xad defence of the border. On the other hand, contrary to Patel‚Äôs advice, the retrenchment plan for the Army, formulated earlier, was put through, and about 50,000 men were sent home in 1951. This rundown was to some extent compensated by the integration of the state forces. In 1953, the Indian Army comprised between 325,000 and 350,000 officers and men of all categories, organized into seven divisions (4, 5, 10, 19, 26 and 27 Infantry Divisions, and 1 Armoured Division), two independent brigades (2 Armoured and 50 Para), administrative Headquarters, depots and installations.\n\nIn the autumn of 1953, there were reports of Chinese activity in the area inhabited by the Tagins, about a day‚Äôs march beyond Daporijo, in NEFA. When an Assam Rifles patrol was sent to investigate, some 300 of the tribesmen attacked its camp in the night. They killed 26 of the party, including the officer in command and a civil official who accompanied him. The remaining 72 men of the party were taken away as hostages, together with all the weapons of the patrol. To rescue the hostages, the Assam Rifles were ordered to mount an operation, with Daporijo as base. However, this place had no landing ground at the time and despatch of troops by land would have taken weeks. By then the hostages would, in all probability, have been massacred. A landing ground was, therefore, quickly built at Daporijo by dropping about a company-strength of paratroopers (infantry and engineers) on 4 November. The action against the Tagins was thereafter taken in hand.\n\nIncidents like this and the one at Walong should have spurred the Indian Government to hasten its preparations for a possible showdown with the Chinese. But it was then busy with the negotiations that brought about the 1954 Agreement. According to Mullik, Nehru‚Äôs suspicions regarding Chinese intentions were aroused on account of their attitude during these negotiations and within a few months of its signing he ordered that frontier posts should be set up. Obviously, the recommendations of the Himmatsinghji Committee in this regard had not been implemented till then. Things moved slowly during the ‚ÄòLotus Decade‚Äô. It is interesting to note that the Indian Government wanted to sign an agreement for 25 years, but the Chinese limited it to eight years.\n\nThe Army carried on with its routine existence from day to day on the premise that it had only to worry about defence against Pakistan. To save money for the country‚Äôs development, the Army was told to economize on expenditure. All sorts of ways of saving money for the Government were thought up. The Director of one of the services at Army Headquarters went so far as to dismantle and dispose of a factory that manufactured jerricans. He brought about a sizeable saving by issuing petrol and kerosene oil to units in bulk, in 200-litre barrels or from kerbside pumps, instead of jerricans. For this he was publicly praised by the Finance Minister. However, the result of this short-sighted economy was that in the 1962 operations in NEFA, there were no jerricans for dropping supplies of kerosene oil to the troops operating on the snow-clad Himalayan slopes. The Air Force had perforce to drop this commodity in 200-litre barrels and the jawans were expected to carry them up and down mountain slopes to their bunkers.\n\nSuch instances could be multiplied ad nauseum. Saving on defence became a fetish in India during this period. The Government went so far as to impose a cut in the men‚Äôs rations. The Army was told to make do with what equipment it had and to improvise for what it did not have. In fact improvisation became a routine in the Army. Among the lower echelons, it came to be known facetiously as doing things on Jai Hind basis.\n\nEven the annual manoeuvres were largely run on Jai Hind basis. An officer who served with the prestigious 1 Armoured Division for three years (1956‚Äì59) says:\n\n‚ÄúAll our vehicles were of Second World War vintage and had seen hard service. The progress of the Divisional column was marked by broken-down vehicles and by the time you reached your destination one-third of the vehicles had been written off. . . .I remember how a column of 40 bridging vehicles was represented by a single lorry flying a chequered flag. When a bridge was required to be ‚Äúconstructed‚Äù, this vehicle was given priority and it used to roar grandly down the road, bypassing all the vehicles on the convoy. What a farce! . . . A minefield was represented by two tapes laid on the ground and we used to carry out a mimicry of clearing mines, which were not there. Sometimes, even this was not done; if it would take eight hours to clear a lane, this time was merely added on paper, and the exercise continued‚Äù.17\n\nA glaring example of the myopia among the policy-makers of the time was the move of Headquarters Eastern Command from Ranchi to Lucknow. NEFA was, and still is, a part of this Command‚Äôs responsibility. At a time when the threat to this region had become apparent, it would have made sense if this Headquarters had been moved further East, so as to be nearer the possible scene of operations. It was instead moved further West, perhaps because of the availability at Lucknow of better accommodation and other amenities for officers. Nearness to Delhi may have been another consideration.\n\nAfter Cariappa, the first decade of Independence saw two more Army Chiefs, not counting Thimayya who took over in May 1957. Cariappa was succeeded by General Rajendrasinhji. Scion of a princely family of Kathiawar, he was commissioned after graduation from Sandhurst. While serving with 2 Lancers in the Second World War, he earned praise for his part in the hard-fought action at Meikili against Rommel‚Äôs Panzers. His gallantry brought him the first DSO to be won by a Sandhurst-trained Indian. To the high office of C‚Äîin‚ÄîC he brought a princely dignity, sincerity and a sense of fair-play. Quiet by nature, he did not have Cariappa‚Äô s swank or his messianic zeal. His tenure lasted a little less than two years. His successor, Shrinagesh, was an infantry soldier from the Kumaon Regiment.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the first three Chiefs did not have much difference in the matter of age or seniority. In fact, Cariappa was younger than his successor. Both Shrinagesh and Rajendrasinhji received their education in the United Kingdom. Shrinagesh served in Burma during the Second World War though he did not see much action. A good speaker and administrator, he held many gubernatorial posts after retirement from the Army in May 1957.\xad\n\nAll that can be said of the tenure of these two Chiefs is that, like good soldiers, they carried out the policies of the Government of the day. They did all they thought was good for the Army, within the financial limits imposed by the Government. Regimental traditions were preserved; so were officers‚Äô messes, with their sacrosanct customs, except that the health of the Head of State was drunk in plain water instead of port or sherry. The morale of the troops was excellent. Good discipline was insisted upon and maintained. So were good turnout and drill. Hindi words of command were introduced. They sounded as impressive, and produced as good results, as the English commands that many generations of Indian soldiers had become used to.\n\nBehind the facade of peacetime ceremonials and nicely kept messes, however, there was a certain hollowness. Appearances came to mean a good deal more than reality. The official history of the Regiment of Artillery has an interesting incident of this period. Some British officers had come to attend a regimental reunion and were taken round the Artillery establishments in the Nasik-Deolali area. ‚ÄòWhen they looked in at the expensive carpet and curtains in a Commandant‚Äôs office, one of them was overheard remarking in an aside ‚Äì ‚ÄúVery nice, but will it fight?‚Äù18\n\nInitiative was discouraged instead of being encouraged. It is normal military practice to study the organization and tactics of other armies and especially those of a possible enemy. During the early fifties, when Nehru heard that a pamphlet on the Chinese Army was being prepared at Army Headquarters, he at once had it stopped.19\n\nWhile war clouds were gathering for India on her Northern borders, there were other developments that affected her security environment adversely. The growth of communist power in Europe and Asia led the United States and her allies to adopt a strategy of containment. The formation of the (NATO) in 1949 had been the first step in this direction. But this, organization, comprising a combined force from signatory nations, was meant chiefly for the defence of Westren Europe. During the mid-fifties the containment was extended to West Asia and South-East. Two organizations were created for this purpose. Like NATO both were sponsored by the USA. The (SEATO) had as its members Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and the USA. The (CENTO) consisted of\xa0Britian, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and the USA. Membership of these organizations gave Pakistan modern weapons and equipment in return for bases on her soil. India too was invited to join these alliance, but refused: such a step would have compromised the policy of non-alignement. With American equipment for Pakistan‚Äôs armed forces, the balance of military power on the Indian sub-continent began to change.\n\nThe Indian Government decided at this stage that it was not going to be drawn into an arms race with Pakistan. But to prepare the people for a struggle against external aggression, a citizens‚Äô Army was created. Initially called the National Volunteer Force, it later came to be known as the Lok Sahayak Sena. The Government planned to train 500,000 citizens over a period of five years. Training camps were set up at various places, chiefly in the Punjab and Army instructors were posted to help train the volunteers. Somehow the idea failed to catch the public imagination and the scheme was later abandoned after a good deal of money had been wasted.\n\nIt was perhaps American aid that made the Pakistans more aggressive in 1956. They created incidents, may be to test Indian reaction. Early that year their troops occupied Chhad Bet, in the Rann of Kutch and opened fire on an Indian patrol that was sent to investgate. The Indian brigade at Ahmedabad took prompt action and forced the Pakistanis to quit. Their attack at Hussainiwala was more serious.\n\nAt this border-post, on the Sutlej River, near Ferozepur, both India and Pakistan had some troops. On the night of 18/19 March, Pakistani troops made a sudden attack on the Indian position, held by 4 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles. The attack was beaten back and the Pakistanis were dislodged from the area they had occupied. During the fighting, Lance Naik Sunder Singh showed great presence of mind and courage of the hightest order in silencing an enemy maching gun. His bravery won him the Ashoka Chakra class 1.20\n\nThere were provocative incidents on the East Pakistan border also. Such occurrences only increased the tensions between the two countries. Some attempts had been made after the signing of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact to bring about a rapprochement. But every time the negotiations came to a dead-end on the question of Kashmir. Pakistan wanted the settlement on her own terms.\n\nBesides the tension with Pakistan and the difficulties with the Chinese, the Indian Government had a revolt on its hands in the Eastern region. The Nagas had been restive for quite some time. By 1954, they were in open revolt. The civil authorities failed to cope with the situation and in 1956 the Army was ordered to deal with it. The insurgency in the region later became a complex affair, involving not only local politics but also covert foreign aid to the insurgents. How the Indian Army tackled the insurgency is the subject of another chapter but the commitment there, as also the build-up in Pakistan, brought a small increase in the strength of the Indian Army.'<br />Author: 'JainPork'  id: 'hspw30'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hspw30/nehru_let_tibet_fall_and_insulted_fm_cariappa/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Fifty years after 1962 : B G Varghese Reports From The Ground During The 1962 War'<br />Body: 'Taken From: [http://www.asianconversations.com/IndiaChinaWar.php](http://www.asianconversations.com/IndiaChinaWar.php)\n\nTHE 1962 Sino-Indian conflict is half-a-century old, but to understand what happened one needs to go further back to Indian independence and the PRC‚Äôs establishment and absorption of Tibet. Perhaps one should go back even earlier to the tripartite Simla Convention of 1914 at which the Government of India, Tibet and China were party and drew the McMahon Line. The Chinese representative initialled the Agreement but did not sign it on account of differences over the definitions of Inner and Outer Tibet.\n\nFast forward to March 1947 when Nehru‚Äôs Interim Government hosted an Asian Relations Conference in Delhi to which Tibet and China (then represented by the KMT) were invited. Both attended. India recognised the PRC as soon as it was established in 1949 and adopted a One-China policy thereafter.\n\nIn 1951 China moved into Tibet. A 17-Point Agreement granted it autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. This converted what until then was a quiet Indo-Tibet boundary into a problematic Sino-Indian frontier, with China adopting all prior Tibetan claims.\n\nEven prior to that Sardar Patel had expressed himself on new security concerns in the Northeast. In a letter to Nehru, he warned that the Himalaya could no longer be regarded as an impenetrable barrier and that the Tibeto-Mongoloid character of the population on ‚Äúour northern and northeastern approaches‚Ä¶ and the penetration of communist ideologies into some of these areas, posed a new threat‚Äù. He accordingly urged a review of border policy and security, including internal security, improvement of rail, road, air and wireless communications, policing and intelligence on the frontier, and territorial claims on India (*Durga Das*, 1973). The Sardar passed away soon thereafter. Nothing changed.\n\nThe historic Sino-Indian Treaty on Relations between India and the Tibet Region of China was signed in 1954. India gave up its rights in Tibet without seeking a quid pro quo. The Panch Shila was enunciated, which Nehru presumed presupposed inviolate boundaries in an era of ‚ÄúHindi-Chini *bhai bhai*‚Äù(brother brother).\n\nThe young Dalai Lama came to India in 1956 to participate in the 2,500th anniversary celebrations commemorating the Enlightenment of the Buddha but was reluctant to return home as he felt China had reneged from its promise of Tibetan autonomy. Chou En-lai visited India later that year and sought Nehru‚Äôs good offices to persuade the Dalai Lama to return to Lhasa on the assurance of implementation of the 17-Point Agreement by China in good faith.\n\nVisiting China in 1954, Nehru drew Chou En-lai‚Äôs attention to the new political map of India which defined the McMahon Line and the J&amp;K Johnson Line as firm borders (and not in dotted lines or vague colour wash as previously depicted) and expressed concern over corresponding Chinese maps that he found erroneous. Chou En-lai replied that the Chinese had not yet found time to correct its old maps but that this would be done ‚Äúwhen the time is ripe‚Äù. Nehru assumed this implied tacit Chinese acceptance of India‚Äôs map alignments but referred to the same matter once again during Chou‚Äôs 1956 visit to India.\n\nThe matter was, however, not pressed. Nehru had in a statement about that time referred to the words of a wise Swedish diplomat to the effect that though a revolutionary power, China would take 20-30 years to fight poverty and acquire the muscle to assert its hegemony. Therefore, it should meanwhile be cultivated and not be isolated and made to feel under siege as the Bolsheviks were in 1917. This postulate was, however, reversed in 1960-62 when Nehru interpreted the same wise Swedish diplomat to mean it was the first 20-30 years after its revolution that were China‚Äôs dangerous decades; thereafter, the PRC would mature and mellow. This suggests a somewhat fickle understanding of China on Nehru‚Äôs part.\n\nThe *Aksai Chin* road had been constructed by China by 1956-57 but only came to notice in 1958 when somebody saw it depicted on a small map in a Chinese magazine. India protested. The very first note in the Sino-Indian White Papers, published later, declared *Aksai Chin* to be ‚Äúindisputably‚Äù Indian territory and, thereafter, incredibly lamented the fact that Chinese personnel had wilfully trespassed into that area ‚Äúwithout proper visas‚Äù. The best construction that can put on this language is that Nehru was even at that time prepared to be flexible and negotiate a peaceful settlement or an appropriate adjustment. Parliament and the public were, however, kept in the dark.\n\nThough outwardly nothing had changed, Nehru had begun to reassess his position. According to his son Ashok Parthasarathi, his father, the late G Parthasarathi met Nehru on the evening of 18 March, 1958, after all concerned had briefed him prior to his departure for Peking as the new Indian Ambassador to China. G Parthasarathi recorded what Nehru said in these terms:\n\n"So GP what has the Foreign Office told you? Hindi-Chini *bhai bhai?* Don\'t you believe it! I don\'t trust the Chinese one bit. They are a deceitful opinionated, arrogant and hegemonistic lot. Eternal vigilance should be your watch word. You shd send all your Telegrams only to me ‚Äì not to the Foreign Office. Also, do not mention a word of this instruction of mine to Krishna. He, you and I all share a common world view and ideological approach. However, Krishna believes ‚Äì erroneously ‚Äì that no Communist country can have bad relations with any Non-Aligned country like ours".\n\nThis is an extraordinary account and is difficult to interpret other than, once again, as symbolising Nehru‚Äôs fickle views on China which GP had no reason to misquote.\n\nChinese incursions and incidents at Longju and Khizemane in Arunachal and the Kongka Pass, Galwan and Chip Chap Valleys in Ladakh followed through 1959. *The Times of India* broke many of these early stories. There was a national uproar. It was while on a conducted tour of border road construction in Ladakh in 1958 with the Army PRO, Ram Mohan Rao that I first heard vague whispers of ‚Äúsome trouble‚Äù further east. We, however, went to Chushul, where the air strip was still open, and beyond to the Pangong Lake unimpeded.\n\nThe Khampa rebellion in Tibet had erupted and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 via Tawang where he received an emotional welcome. The Government of India granted him asylum along with his entourage and over 100,000 refugees that followed and he took up residence with his government-in-exile in Dharamsala. These events greatly disturbed the Chinese and marked a turning point in Sino-Indian relations. Their suspicions about India‚Äôs intentions were not improved by Delhi‚Äôs connivance in facilitating American-trained Tibetan refugee guerrillas to operate in Tibet and further permitting an American listening facility to be planted on the heights of Nanda Devi to monitor Chinese signals in Tibet.\n\nChina had by now commenced its westward cartographic-cum-military creep in Ladakh and southward creep in Arunachal.\n\nThe highly regarded Chief of Army Staff, Gen KS Thimayya began to envisage a new defence posture vis-√†-vis China in terms of plans, training, logistics and equipment. However, Krishna Menon, aided by BN Mullick, the IB Chief and intelligence czar, who also was close to Nehru, disagreed with this threat perception and insisted that attention should remain focused on Pakistan and the ‚Äúanti-Imperialist forces‚Äù. Growing interference by Krishna Menon, now Defence Minister, in Army postings and promotions and strategic perspectives so frustrated Thimayya that he tendered his resignation to Nehru in 1959. Fearing a major crisis, the PM persuaded Thimayya to withdraw his resignation, which he unfortunately did at the cost of his authority. Nothing changed. Mullick and Menon sowed in Nehru‚Äôs mind the notion that a powerful Chief might stage a coup (as Ayub had done). This myth was for long a factor in Government‚Äôs aversion to the idea of appointing a Chief of Defence Staff.\n\nPresident Ayub of Pakistan had, on a brief stopover meeting with Nehru in Delhi en route to Dhaka in 1959, proposed ‚Äújoint defence‚Äù. Joint defence against whom, was Nehru‚Äôs scornful and unthinking retort? Yet Nehru was not unconscious of a potential threat from the north as he had from the early 1950s repeatedly told Parliament that the Himalayan rampart was India‚Äôs defence and defence line. He had somewhat grandiloquently and tactlessly proclaimed that though Nepal was indeed a sovereign nation, when it came to India‚Äôs security, India‚Äôs defence lay along the Kingdom‚Äôs northern border, Nepal‚Äôs independence notwithstanding! Yet he had been remarkably lax in preparing to defend that not-quite-so- impenetrable a rampart (as I had argued in an article in *The Times of India* in 1950) or even countenance his own military from doing so.\n\nHowever, almost a decade later, Himalayan border road construction commenced under the Border Roads Organisation and forward positions were established. This Forward Policy, though opposed by Lt Gen Daulat Singh, GOC-in-C Western Command, was pushed by Krishna Menon, de facto Foreign Minister, and equally by B N Mullick, who played a determining role in these events, being present in all inner councils. Many of the 43 new posts established in Ladakh were penny packets with little capability and support or military significance. The objective appeared more political, in fulfilment of an utterly fatuous slogan Nehru kept uttering in Parliament and elsewhere, that ‚Äúnot an inch of territory‚Äù would be left undefended though he had earlier played down the *Aksai Chin* incursion as located in a cold, unpopulated, elevated desert ‚Äúwhere not a blade of grass grows‚Äù. In August Nehru announced that Indian forces had regained 2,500sq m of the 12,000sq m occupied by the Chinese in Ladakh.\n\nA series of Sino-Indian White Papers continued to roll out. *The Times of India* commented on 15 August, 1962: ‚ÄúAnyone reading the latest White Paper on Sino-Indian relations together with some of the speeches by the Prime Minister and Defence Minister on the subject may be forgiven for feeling that the Government‚Äôs China policy, like *chop suey*, contains a bit of everything ‚Äì firmness and conciliation, bravado and caution, sweet reasonableness and defiance‚Ä¶ We have been variously informed‚Ä¶ that the situation on the border is both serious and not so serious; that we have got the better of the Chinese and they have got the better of us; that the Chinese are retreating and that they are advancing‚Ä¶ ‚Äù.\n\nBackseat driving of defence policy continued to the end of Thimayya‚Äôs tenure when General PN Thapar was appointed COAS in preference to Thimayya‚Äôs choice of Lt Gen SPP Thorat, Eastern Army Commander. Thorat had produced a paper in the prevailing circumstances advocating that while the Himalayan heights might be prepared as a trip-wire defence, NEFA should essentially be defended lower down at its waist which, among other things, would ease the Indian Army‚Äôs logistical and acclimatisation problems and correspondingly aggravate those of the Chinese. The Thorat plan, ‚ÄúThe China Threat and How to Meet It‚Äù, got short shrift.\n\nThe Goa operation at the end of 1960 witnessed two strange events. The new Chief of General Staff (CGS), Lt Gen BM Kaul, marched alongside one of the columns of the 17th Division under Gen Candeth that was tasked to enter Goa. Thereafter he and, separately, the Defence Minister, Krishna Menon, declared ‚Äúwar‚Äù or the commencement of operations at two different times: one at midnight and the other at first light the next morning. In any other situation such flamboyant showmanship could have been disastrous. However, Goa was a cake walk and evoked the mistaken impression among gifted amateurs in high places that an unprepared Indian Army could take on China.\n\nKaul‚Äôs promotion to the rank of Lt Gen and then to key post of CGS had stirred controversy. He was politically well connected and had held staff and PR appointments but was without command experience. The top brass was divided and the air thick with intrigue and suspicion. Kaul had inquiries made into the conduct of senior colleagues like Thorat, SD Verma and then Maj Gen Sam Manekshaw, Commandant of the Staff College in Wellington!\n\nEven as the exchange of Sino-Indian notes continued, Nehru on 12 October, 1962 said he had ordered the Indian Army ‚Äúto throw the Chinese out‚Äù, something casually revealed to the media at Palam airport before departing on a visit to Colombo!\n\nA new 4 Corps was created on 8 October, 1962 with headquarters at Tezpur to reinforce the defence of the Northeast. Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh was named GOC but was soon moved to take over 33 Corps at Siliguri and then moved again to the Western Command. Kaul took charge of 4 Corps but appeared to have assumed a superior jurisdiction because of his direct political line to Delhi. Command controversies were further compounded as at times it seemed that both everybody and nobody was in charge. Thapar himself and Gen LP Sen, now at Eastern Command, also went to recce and reorder defence plans along the Bomdila-Se La sector. At the political level and at the External Affairs Ministry the adage was ‚ÄúPanditji knows best‚Äù.\n\nKaul was here, there and everywhere, exposing himself in high altitudes without acclimatisation. No surprise that he fell ill and was evacuated to Delhi on 18 October, only to return five days later.\n\nFollowing Nehru‚Äôs ‚Äúthrow them out‚Äù order, and against saner military advice and an assessment of ground realities, a brigade under John Dalvi was positioned on the Namka Chu River below the Thagla Ridge that the Chinese claimed lay even beyond the McMahon Line. It was a self-made trap. It was but to do or die. The brigade retreated in disorder after a gallant action, while the Chinese rolled down to Tawang which they reached on 25 October.\n\n*The Economist* parodied Kipling. A text of a pithy editorial titled ‚ÄúPlain Tales from the Hills‚Äù read, ‚ÄúWhen the fog cleared, The Chinese were there‚Äù! That said it all.\n\nA new defence line was hurriedly established at Se La.\n\nI was not in the country during the Namka Chu battle but returned soon thereafter and was asked to go to Tezpur from Bombay to cover the war.\n\nNehru was by now convinced that the Chinese were determined to sweep down to the plains. The national mood was one despondency, anger, foreboding. Only one commentator, *The Times of India* editor, N J Nanporia, who sadly just passed away recently, got it right. In a closely reasoned edit page article, he argued that the Chinese favoured negotiation and a peaceful settlement, not invasion, and India must talk. At worst the Chinese would teach India a lesson and go back. Critics scoffed at Nanporia. I, too, thought he was being simplistic. A week or 10 days later, in response to his critics, he reprinted the very same article down to the last comma and full-stop. Events proved him absolutely right.\n\nOn 24 October, Chou En-lai proposed a 20km withdrawal by either side. Three days later Nehru sought the enlargement of this buffer to 40km-60km. On 4 November, Chou offered to accept the McMahon Line provided India accepted the Macdonald Line in Ladakh approximating the Chinese claim line (giving up the more northerly Johnson Line, favoured by Delhi).\n\nI was by now in Tezpur, lodged in the very pleasant Planter‚Äôs Club which had become a media dormitory. The Army arranged for the press to visit the NEFA front. Scores of Indian and foreign correspondents and cameramen volunteered. Col Pyara Lal, the chief Army PRO, took charge. On 15-17 November we drove up to Se La (15,000ft) and down to Dirang Dzong in the valley beyond before the climb to Bomdila. Jawans in cottons and perhaps a light sweater and canvas shoes were manhandling ancient 25-pounders into position at various vantage points. We had seen and heard Bijji Kaul‚Äôs theatrics and bravado at 4 Corps Headquarters a day earlier and were shocked to see the reality: ill-equipped, unprepared but cheerful officers and men digging in to hold back the enemy under the command of a very gallant officer, Brig Hoshiar Singh.\n\nWe had barely returned to Tezpur on 17 November when we learnt that the Chinese had mounted an attack on Se La and outflanked it as well. Many correspondents rushed back to Delhi and Calcutta more easily to file their copy and despatch their pictures and footage. Military censorship delayed transmission. I discovered later that between the Tezpur PO‚Äôs inability to handle much copy and censorship, few if any of my despatches reached *The Times of India* and those that did had been severely truncated.\n\nEven as battle was joined, Kaul, disappeared from Tezpur to be with his men, throwing the chain of command into disarray. The saving grace was the valiant action fought by Brigadier Navin Rawley at Walong in the Luhit Valley before making an orderly retreat, holding back the enemy wherever possible. Much gallantry was also displayed in Ladakh against heavy odds.\n\nThe use of the air force had been considered. Some thought that the IAF had the edge as its aircraft would be operating with full loads from low altitude air strips in Assam unlike the Chinese operating from the Tibetan plateau at base altitudes of 11,000-12,000ft. However, the decision was avoid use of offensive air power to prevent escalation (which Marshal of the Air Force, Arjan Singh, and the current Air Chief, Air Marshal NAK Browne, have recently criticised).\n\nOn 18 November, word came that the Chinese had enveloped Se La, which finally fell without much of a fight in view of conflicting orders. A day later the enemy had broken through to Foothills (both a place name and a description) along the Kameng axis. Confusion reigned supreme.\n\nKaul or somebody ordered the 4th Corps to pull back to Gauhati on 19 November and, as military convoys streamed west, somebody else ordered that Tezpur and the North Bank be evacuated. A ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù policy was ordered by somebody else again and the Nunmati refinery was all but blown up. The DM deserted his post. A former school and college mate of mine, Rana KDN Singh, was directed to take charge of a tottering administration. He supervised the Joint Steamer Companies, mostly manned by East Pakistan lascars, as they ferried a frightened and abandoned civil population to the South Bank. The other modes of exodus were by bus and truck, car, cart, cycle and on foot. The last ferry crossing was made at 6pm. Those who remained or reached the jetty late, melted into the tea gardens and forest.\n\nThe Indian press had ingloriously departed the previous day, preferring safety to real news coverage ‚Äì as happened again in Kashmir in 1990, when at least women journalists subsequently redeemed the profession. Only two Indians remained in Tezpur, Prem Prakash of *Visnews* and *Reuters*, and I, together with nine American and British correspondents. Along with us, wandering around like lost souls, were some 10-15 patients who had been released from the local mental hospital.\n\nThat was the most eerie night I have every spent. Tezpur was a ghost town. We patrolled it by pale moonlight on the alert for any tell-tale signs or sounds. The State Bank had burned its currency chest and a few charred notes kept blowing in the wind as curious mental patients kept prodding the dying embers. Some stray dogs and alley cats were our only other companions.\n\nAround midnight, a transistor with one of our colleagues crackled to life as Radio Peking announced a unilateral ceasefire and pull back to the pre-October ‚Äúline of actual control‚Äù, provided the Indian Army did not move forward. Relieved and weary we repaired to our billet at the abandoned Planter‚Äôs Club whose canned provisions of baked beans, tuna fish and beer (all on the house) had sustained us.\n\nNext morning, all the world carried the news, but AIR still had brave jawans gamely fighting the enemy as none had had the gumption to awaken Nehru and take his orders as the news was too big to handle otherwise! Indeed, during the preceding days, everyone from general to jawan to officials and the media, but everyone, was tuned into Radio Pekingto find out what was going on in our own country. *Satyameve Jyate*! (roughly translated as victory in truth). But even today we still lack a coherent communications policy.\n\n1962 was a politically determined military disaster. President Radhakrishnan said it all when he indicted the Government for its ‚Äúcredulity and negligence‚Äù. Nehru himself confessed, artfully using the plural, ‚ÄúWe were getting out of touch with reality‚Ä¶ and living in an artificial world of our own creation‚Äù. Yet he was reluctant to get rid of Krishna Menon, (making him, first, Minister for Defence Production and then Minister without Portfolio, in which capacity he brazenly carried on much as before). Public anger finally compelled the PM to drop him altogether or risk losing his own job.\n\nNehru was broken and bewildered. His letter to John F Kennedy seeking US military assistance after the fall of Bomdila was abject and pathetic. He feared that unless the tide was stemmed the Chinese would overrun the entire Northeast. He said they were massing troops in the Chumbi Valley and he apprehended another ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù from there. If Chushul was overrun, there was nothing to stop the Chinese before Leh. The IAF had not been used as India lacked air defence for its population centres. He therefore requested immediate air support by 12 squadrons of all-weather supersonic fighters with radar cover, all operated by US personnel. But US aircraft were not to intrude into Chinese air space.\n\nOne does not know what and whose inputs went into drafting Nehru‚Äôs letter to Kennedy.\xa0 Non-alignment was certainly in tatters.\n\nTezpur limped back to life. On 21 November, Lal Bahadur Shastri, the Home Minister, paid a flying visit on a mission of inquiry and reassurance. He was followed the next day by Indira Gandhi. Nehru had meanwhile broadcast to the nation, and more particularly to ‚Äúthe people of Assam‚Äù to whom his ‚Äúheart went out‚Äù at this terrible hour of trial. He promised the struggle would continue and none should doubt its outcome. Hearing the broadcast in Tezpur, however, it did not sound like a Churchillian trumpet of defiance. Rather, it provided cold comfort to the Assamese, many of whom hold it against the Indian state to this day that Nehru had bidden them ‚Äúfarewell‚Äù.\n\nI remained in Tezpur day after day for a month, waiting day after day for the administration to return to Bomdila. This it did under the Political Officer (DM), Major K C Johorey just before Christmas. I accompanied him. The people of NEFA had stood solidly with India and Johorey received a warm welcome.\n\nThapar had been removed and Gen J N Chaudhuri appointed COAS. Kaul went into limbo. The Naga underground took no advantage of India‚Äôs plight. Pakistan had been urged by Iran and the US not to use India‚Äôs predicament to further its own cause and kept its word. But it developed a new relationship with China thereafter.\n\nThe US and the West had been sympathetic to India and its Ambassador, Galbraith, had a direct line to Kennedy. However, the US was also preoccupied with growing Sino-Soviet divide and the major Cuban missile crisis that boiled over in October 1962.\n\nThe COAS, Gen Choudhury ordered an internal inquiry into the debacle by Maj Gen Henderson Brooks and Brigadier PS Bhagat. The Henderson Brooks Report remains a top-secret classified document though its substance was leaked and published by Neville Maxwell who served as the London *Times* correspondent in India in the 1960s, became a Sinophile and wrote a critical book titled ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs China War‚Äù. The report brings out the political and military naivet√©, muddle, contradictions and in-fighting that prevailed and failures of planning and command. There is no military secret to protect in the Henderson Brooks Report; only political and military ego and folly to hide. But unless the country knows, the appropriate lessons will not be learnt.\n\nIndia did not learn the lesson that borders are more important than boundaries and continued to neglect the development of Arunachal and North Assam lest China roll down the hill again. However, given the prevailing global and regional strategic environment and India‚Äôs current military preparedness, the debacle of 1962 will not be repeated.\n\nMany have since recorded their versions of what happened in 1962: Kaul, Dalvi, D K (Monty) Palit (who served under Kaul as Director of Military Operations), Neville Maxwell, S Gopal in Volume III of his Nehru biography, S S Khera, Principal Defence Secretary and Cabinet Secretary, in his ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs Defence Problem‚Äù, Y B Chavan, as retold in his biography by T V Kunhi Krishnan, and others. Each has a tale to tell. But the truth, differently interpreted though widely suspected, remains the greatest casualty of 1962.'<br />Author: 'JainPork'  id: 'hs4i1q'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hs4i1q/fifty_years_after_1962_b_g_varghese_reports_from/</li>

Although all of them were also caught in rain the same day to some extent and most of them did not show any fever after a day, so we are not sure if the fever is because of covid. \n\nThe branch manager have had fever continuously since day 1, he somehow managed to get the check-up done 2 days earlier but with no reports yet.

It is sight to see and makes you believe that all is not lost, while the world is still a trying to find a sense of normalcy amidst the corona virus scares. \n\nThere is a temporary migrant children‚Äôs school in progress under the Bolgatty-Vallarpadam bridge. Children of all age groups can be seen studying there. They are all primarily children of the migrant workers stuck in the city and who have not been able to go back to their home towns amidst the lockdown situations. \n\nThe area under the bridge is also home to some labourer families, where teachers from the St John Bosco‚Äôs UP School are now running a makeshift school.  Most of these children were going to local schools. But due to lockdown they had no means of making use of online classes. Teachers arranged computers and are helping these children receive education all maintain protocols of hygiene and sanitization. \n\nTeachers include Shamiya Baby, Neema Thomas and Susan Mable‚Äîand the school headmistress Elizabeth Fernandez who also give biscuits and face masks to these kids each day, as they embark on a journey of learning amidst tough times for survival. \n\nWhile technology has tried to bridge the social distancing gaps, there are those children from the underprivileged backgrounds that cannot find means to continue their education in the pandemic times. There is a lack of infrastructure for them, a problem that cannot be solved unless the government can intervene to provide some kind of support system. \n\n[https://www.theworkersrights.com/migrant-workers/2020/07/15/how-children-found-education-under-a-bridge-in-kerala/](https://www.theworkersrights.com/migrant-workers/2020/07/15/how-children-found-education-under-a-bridge-in-kerala/)'<br />Author: 'theworkersrights'  id: 'hrm066'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hrm066/how_children_found_education_under_a_bridge_in/</li>

Now before you start thinking Alas! We are alone in this world. No country is our friend! We should see this as an opportunity. We should accelerate our efforts to develop non-conventional sources of energy like solar energy, wind energy, biofuel etc. If we reduce our dependence on oil, we'll be doing a great service to our country.\n\nDevelop indigenous information infrastructure in India. Instead of being proud for our guys placed in Google and Facebook, we should work on developing information infrastructure in India so that our data doesn't fall into the hands of other country.\n\nBe aware of what's happening in other countries. Everything is connected. Indifference to the struggle of people of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibetans won't help us. Be aware of the massacre of Armenians by Turkey.\n\nBe aware of things happening outside Delhi and Mumbai. The pouring in of foreign investment in the southern states especially Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Telangana and in the north Eastern states especially Manipur and Nagaland should be checked. Everyone should remember if foreign powers enter India, their regional identity and culture would be the first to vanish.

      <li>Title::: 'Tiger Parenting / Authoritarian Parenting'<br />Body: 'The very moment I see \'Indian\', I know you have been abused. In India, you will be judged by the Indian society as horrible and ungrateful if you tell them that your parent might have abused you. Indian parents often resort to physical, verbal, mental, emotional abuse; mostly because they have been raised that way. This is a stupid backward society which keeps on practising the authoritarian system of parenting despite being a democracy. Your parents are pure narcissists who I know for a fact are highly toxic and simultaneously brainwash you into being grateful for providing you with basic amenities, something which all parents do and are legally bound to. Oh, btw, you were simply meant to be your parents\' retirement plan that they have invested in you, nothing more than that, if you have Indian parents that is. Just cut off all contact from your toxic af Indian parents. \n\nThey show you off to their peers and ironically, claim that your achievements are a result of their excellent parenting. It like beating the shit out of a dog to train him jst to win the local dog competition and bear the "best dog trainer" title. Everything revolves around reputation in India. This has created self-centred bastards everywhere in India who can go to any extent in order to uphold/improve their reputation and to flaunt/boast themselves by being condescending to others. This is also misused by a lot of Indian parents. Initially they shout at and beat the child when the kid makes a mistake. Later on in their lives they become completely intolerant and start abusing their kids for almost no reason whatsoever. They derive pleasure by bullying their kids. As an excuse they say that they have a short temper and can\'t control it. Do not fall for their shit. They think of you as mere extensions of themselves and ignore or crush you individuality. Your parents are horrible, abusive, toxic, inhuman and rotten to the very core of their existence. Avoid contact with them as much as possible or even better, cut off those toxic bastards out of your life, go NC (no contact). I hope you have a happy future.\n\n\\~Best wishes from a fellow Indian sufferer'<br />Author: 'singhabhisekh'  id: 'hqx1or'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hqx1or/tiger_parenting_authoritarian_parenting/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Iran drops India from chahbar rail project - cites funding delay'<br />Body: "Iran has been India's strategic ally for a long time now and has been providing us with oil. When tensions between US and Iran were on the rise, US came up with CAATSA, which basically instructs many countries not to do trade with Iran so as to corner Iran financially. India overcame that hurdle with reducing oil import and started investing in chahbar port. The aim was to further strengthen ind-iran ties and also check on gwadar Port which is problematic for India due to its usage for CPEC. \nThere was also a proposition to develope a railway line chahbar-zahedan line which would be a part of 'transit and transportation corridor in trilateral agreement between India, Iran and Afghanistan‚Äù. IRCON had promised to provide all services, superstructure work and financing for the project. \nBut recently Iran has inaugrated the line itself saying no funding has been recieved from India. \nIndia itself might have been stoping funding due to worries that it would attract US attention. Nonetheless IRAN has started working on the project and despite New Delhi's statement that India can join at a later stage, Tehran refutes the word.\n\nThe news is especially important because it came just after the visit of Chinese President xi jinping has finalised  a 25 year strategic partnership which includes Iran selling oil to china at a reduced price.\nBut it will also increase the Chinese presence in the chahbar port. Iranian officials denied a report that also suggested Chabahar port, where India took, will be leased to China. However, Iran proposed a tie-up between the Chinese-run Pakistani port at Gwadar and Chabahar last year. Well that's highly unlikely to happen. \n\nNew Delhi should closely monitor such activities so as to avert a disaster in the western sector. Chahbar port is a key trading point with afg and Central asia as well.\nSource : The Hindu"<br />Author: 'Aspirantak'  id: 'hquai0'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hquai0/iran_drops_india_from_chahbar_rail_project_cites/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Controversial - Caste vs Varna ( not denying the caste based oppression of people )'<br />Body: "Maybe varna system is being corrupted as caste system.\n\nMaybe because we don't have a definite answer.\n\nLike Sati pratha, you can read in Mahabharat or Ramayana or any other stories, no where is mentioned that widows are forced or even willingly become Sati.\nBecause it was a recent thing, which mainly happen because women want to protect their dignity. Like you had seen in Padmavati movie. \n\nOr like recent real life male version Chandra Shekhar Azaad while being chased by british police , he's injured and going to caught by them so he choose to shot himself with the last bullet he had. So that british don't catch him or die from their hands.\n\nBefore Ayodhya verdict has come mostly of the people says (many still do) that Tulsidas Ramayana is very recent (Aurangjeb times) and changed and add details to describe ayodhya and other places and rivers of the story to made false claim.\nMeans that Tulsidas ramayana details are made up and not real. Today's Ayodhya in not the real ayodhya but they made it and added details like river mountains as to falsely prove that this is the real Ayodhya.\n\nI give one more analogy ( I am not denying oppression of people based on caste)\n- We all imagine alien as someone has legs and hands , eyes etc. I mean we imagine them as big eyes big brains , small size everything but they basic is same they have hands we have 5 fingers they might only have 3 but they have, we have really hard time to imagine Alien as a other thing very different from human, because we never encountered one.\n\nSo, when britishers come to India or other religions, they don't have anything such as Varna system which is based on you Karma.\nThey might confuse it which there existing social structure.\n\nAlso, we says in last 6 years there's a attempt to change the history. Even in the time of easily accessible information and we still say this. \nThink what could be happen in 200-300 years when information is shared mostly only orally.\n\nAnd the forced conversions , how can you convert someone either by force or misinformation or maybe showing reality, or maybe defaming the customs they follow. \nIf society is divided , ruling over them is easy because they will be busy fighting each other.\n\nLike English language, all our regional languages are suffering because we don't want other Indian language to become superior. So, we choose English to be the most superior language. Every state things if my language can't be the national language , I will support a foreign language but never the other regional language.\n\nAlso, Ambedkar in his book mentioned that in Gurukul kids from every caste study same thing together , and after the completion they choose there Field of work and now there caste is decided.\n\nThere's a book province and castes by british writer, in that it is clearly mentioned that britishers brought a particular caste from villages to cities to clean roads and stuff. The brahmins who give marriage dates and other important events Kundali Mahurats etc are considered lower than Farmers, because they beg for food and depended on offerings. Teacher Brahmins are considered highest. Whole communities just by giving up or changing profession changed their social hierarchy.\n\n\nAgain I am not supporting caste system or denying the injustice and oppression of any caste.\n\nI am saying that we can't be sure that it is happening from thousands of years , it might be as recent as 400-500 years or 800-1000. Who knows the truth.\n\nIt's just a thought , I am not saying what I am saying is the only truth."<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfMars'  id: 'hql29k'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hql29k/controversial_caste_vs_varna_not_denying_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: "[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] UK's Brexit plans, drama at the UNSC, and the SS San Flaviano"<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread. As the Coronavirus continues to rage in many parts of the world, it is slowly turning into a new normal - and other issues are starting to flare up. This is the thread where we discuss events from around the world, which do not have to be related to India. Here are some big stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top stories:\n\n1. [China announces tit-for-tat sanctions on US Senators](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53387331)\n\nA week after the US announced travel and financial sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the Uighur genocide in Xinjiang, China announced retaliatory sanctions on prominent US officials, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz who have been outspoken critics of China, as well as US  Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback. A bombshell investigation showing forced sterilization of Uighur women has led to call for a UN investigation over China\'s actions.\n\n2. [UNSC re-authorizes Syrian aid after much drama](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-security-council-resolution-syria-crossing)\n\nAfter a fifth attempt, the UN Security Council voted to allow the UN to deliver aid (like food and medicines) to Syrians through just one border crossing with Turkey. The US and other Western countries were pushing for the aid to be allowed through two existing crossings as well as an additional one in Iraq, claiming that it was necessary to help refugees deal with outbreaks of COVID-19. However, Russia and China repeatedly vetoed those resolutions, claiming that the US ships weapons to Syrian rebels through those crossings. They wanted the entire aid program shut down completely. Ultimately, the Council agreed to allow just one border crossing to be operational, with Russia and China abstaining from that vote. \n\n3. [China imposes new security law on Hong Kong](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53330650)\n\nEnding over a year of controversy and protests, China finally imposed its National Security Law on Hong Kong, the first significant dent to the \'One Country Two Systems\' setup. Through the law, China setup a National Security office in the territory in a temporary office in a hotel, staffed by people from the mainland, for the first time. Already, there are reports of protesters and students being arrested by the Law and transferred to the mainland for prosecution. All courts in mainland China are controlled by the Communist Party, and defendants are rarely found to be innocent. \n\n4. [UK to unveil plan for post-Brexit world](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1308396/rishi-sunak-uk-chancellor-EU-brexit-economy-Michael-Gove-home-Secretary-Priti-Patel-news)\n\nAs the deadline for the end of the transition period of Brexit - Dec 31 - approaches, Boris Johnson\'s government is set to unveil its plan for Britain\'s future. Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to unveil a plan to create ten \'freeports\' in the UK - port cities that would be outside of the country\'s customs laws, which they hope would become International trade centres. The country is also working on over $800 mn worth of infrastructure for border control systems with the EU. Home Minister Priti Patel meanwhile, is all set to launch a new points-based immigration system from Jan 1, 2021, to reduce low-skilled immigration and encourage high-skilled workers to move to the UK. \n\n5. [Conservative Polish President set to be re-elected](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/12/europe/poland-presidential-election-result-intl/index.html)\n\n Poland\'s incumbent President Andrzej Duda\'s campaign declared victory in the country\'s closely-contested Presidential election, a vote that has many in the EU on the edge. Poland, along with Hungary, has refused to toe the EU line on refugees and has often been a sticking point for greater EU integration. Duda, like his counterparts around the world, has adopted a populist, right-wing agenda, expanding social welfare programs while pushing for traditional Catholic values, including opposition to LGBTQ rights. Duda became the first foreign leader to visit Washington, DC amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, when leaders of the G7 countries refused to attend a re-scheduled summit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The case of the SS San Flaviano\n\nMost of us in India have heard of Indonesian dictator Sukarno - famous for the Bandung Conference and one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. After Independence in 1950, Indonesia faced a lot of political instability, which ultimately led to Sukarno developing the concept of "Guided Democracy" (similar to the concept used by the Pakistani Army) - essentially abolishing competitive elections and concentrating power to himself. Indeed, after 1957, the next democratic election in Indonesia was held in only 1999!\n\nNaturally, there was opposition to Sukarno\'s seizure of power - most prominently by the rebel group Permesta, which was supported and armed by the US, UK, and Australia. While the rebels only had limited success, the sinking of the crude oil carrier SS San Flaviano shows the extent to which the CIA tried to topple Sukarno. The ship was part of the UK fleet of the petroleum giant Royal Dutch Shell. In April, 1958, the ship was unloading crude oil in Indonesia\'s East Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo when it was bombed and sunk by an unmarked B-26 bomber. The incident led to Shell immediately suspending all operations in Indonesia and withdrawing its staff and their families to safety in Singapore (still a British Crown Colony then). \n\nAll sides immediately blamed Permesta rebels, although the rebels never claimed any involvement. On 18 May, Indonesian forces shot down a B-26 (a different one) that was run by Permesta, which provided the final push for a violent confrontation that ultimately led to the rebels\' defeat. However, there was actually more to the story than that. The downed B-26 was piloted CIA pilot Allen Pope (who was captured after ejection), and the sinking of the B-26 was also planned and executed by the CIA with very little input from Permesta. The CIA was aiming to weaken Sukarno by driving trade and investment away from Indonesia, which they did to the extent of Shell exiting the country. \n\nAnd yet, nobody blamed the CIA. The Western powers obviously blamed the rebels because their actions were tantamount to a declaration of war. Yet, even Indonesia blamed the rebels despite capturing a CIA pilot - because Sukarno wanted to eliminate the rebels violently, and this gave him the perfect excuse to do it! And so you had the strange situation where the CIA won the battle of hurting Indonesia\'s economy, but Sukarno won the war by eliminating the rebels, and ironically both did it through the very same event! Perhaps a good lesson to think before you shoot. \n\nOf course, Sukarno\'s victory was short-lived, as he became increasingly unpopular, and was eventually replaced with another dictator, Major General Suharto, in 1965. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories from around the world caught your attention?*'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'hqhq14'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hqhq14/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_uks/</li>

Allowing in skilled workers and offering them a good standard of living can help a country in the long run. That being said, this will not apply to India as skilled immigration into the country is unlikely. Immigration should definitely be controlled.\n\nOpinion on the current government: This is a tough one. Very mixed views in all honesty. There is a definite strong religious bias which while I though initially was simply weeding out the appeasement politics done in the past decades, it has definitely become to overtly strong now in my opinion. There was no reason to communalise the Jamaat incident (although that is something that I blame the extreme supporters of the party more than the party directly). I also strongly dislike the beef politics (you can\'t control who eats and trades in what in a democracy) and feel like Amit Shah and even more so, Yogi Adityanath are too big of hardliners for national politics. Modi\'s current cabinet is a huge step down from the previous cabinet. Nirmala Sitharaman simply does not understand Indian economics and as an economics student, the amount of "jhumlabaaji" done with "20 crore stimulus package" was painful. The country misses Arun Jaitley, who was a voice of reason in the party. Now it is starting to feel like the ideology is being prioritised rather than the economy. (There is no reason to spend 1000 cr on building the Ram Mandir at such a precarious time for the economy, no matter how old an election promise it may be). That being said, I think foreign policy (apart from that with border nations) is defintely a strong point. Maintaining strong relations with both Germany and the US for example (which don\'t necessarily get along very well) and maintaining its stance on Palestine\'s sovereignity while at the same time  strengthening relations with Israel and finding a potential alternative to Russian military dependance in France all speak of tactful foreign policy. Dr Jaishankar is a breath of fresh air in a rather disappointing cabinet.'<br />Author: 'DiR910'  id: 'hq9bqm'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hq9bqm/what_is_your_ideology_no_discussion_no/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Pls read itll give you a life lesson credit-@Hastivarman'<br />Body: '\n\nGobindadeva Ratha wasn\'t always the aging warlord we know him best as.\n\nDuring the reign of Highking Anangabhimadeva III, he was mere junior officer, newly inducted into the Oriya Military-Bureaucracy. He probably had several adventures then.\n\nThis one was given to me in a dream.\n\nWhen he was 18, Gobindadeva was inducted as an inspector into the Taxation Department. His original posting was in rural hinterland of Orissa, but since he\'d been newly married to a 14 year old girl, he requested permission for more rigorous, albeit shorter duration, of posting.\n\nFor his sins, the Government of Orissa gave him what he wanted.\n\nHe was now special liaison to the City of Andhernagari to the North for an year.\n\nGobindadeva- ignorant of what awaited him- collected his papers, said goodbye to his parents &amp; wife, &amp; left atop his horse.\n\nUpon reaching Andhernagari, he was treated with the respect due to an Imperial Oriya officer. He was given a palatial house with attached offices, stables, a small temple, a torture chamber, &amp; many servants.\n\nHe was pleased at first, &amp; spent a happy evening flogging peasants.\n\nThe next day, he reached the Taxation office in the inner Citadel.\n\nHe found it packed with staff.\n\nNext he noted that most were women.\n\nNext he noted that most didn\'t seem to be working.\n\nHe sighed as he got out his riding whip to teach them lessons in Accounting.\n\nOfficer Chaupat interrupted him. "Young Saar, how can you lash these poor girls? See how hard they are working despite their tender age?"\n\nGobindadeva said angrily, "You fork-tongued liar! Most are mid 20s at least &amp; those sitting at the back, late 20s. How are they young?"\n\nGobindadeva continued, "I see them doing no work &amp; those at the back are just talking with those other young girls. You should have discipline in office. Why do you have no men here, BTW?"\n\nOfficer Chaupat, sweating profusely, told him: "Our ways are different from yours, Saar!"\n\nThe Andhernagari continued: "Saar, no offence- but the Bureaucracy of Orissa is infamous across Bharata for its cruel practices, domination of the peasantry, and outdated, bigotted orthodoxy. We at Andhernagari follow the Yadava example &amp; our own ideas on progress."\n\nHe said: "We encourage both men &amp; women to read &amp; write. We encourage them to do as they will. Thus, being free, they need no lash &amp; work of their own accord, being driven by hope of improvement. There is no giving of marriage or enforcement of sacrifice. Thus we are Just &amp; Kind"\n\nGobindadeva, being young, was impressed: "Kind Saar, you have opened my eyes. Since birth, the lash &amp; discipline is all my teachers gave me so that I would follow the laws &amp; customs of the Oriya faithfully. I was told that this way, I would protect Orissa from the Turaka best."\n\nChaupat continued: "We defy the Turaka too. Our soldiers are valiant &amp; our officers, being very enlightened, strive to ensure that our ways of freedom are preserved. Take your chair, young Saar. There is nothing to do for you so you rest."\n\nHe put Gobindadeva in a rich room.\n\nGobindadeva, feeling very modern, walked into the room carelessly.\n\nInside he found a bed &amp; a young girl on it.\n\nHe whipped her &amp; told her to get him a low desk, a cushioned stool, &amp; proper drawers since he didn\'t want to get carpal tunnel syndrome from poor writing posture.\n\nAs he was checking the corners for hidden tunnels, Chaupat came in wringing his hands. "Saar, are you angry?"\n\n"Yes, kind Saar. I found no desk in my room, but a bed. How will I work? And that girl clerk was lying on that bed. I will tolerate indiscipline in my office."\n\nChaupat looked confused, but nodded &amp; gave orders. He said it\'ll take a week for the desk to arrive.\n\nGobindadeva replied he will go &amp; encourage the carpenters with lashings, &amp; rushed out, with Chaupat following helplessly behind.\n\nThey soon reached the Woods guild area.\n\nThere, Gobindadeva saw two goons harassing a shopkeeper. He charged at them on his horse &amp; struck them down.\n\n"Call the pliss, my good man," he told the stunned trader, "before I lose my temper &amp; fine you."\n\n"Saar, those two weren\'t goons, but pliss taking protection money.\n\nGobindadeva was incensed. He lashed the 2 who turned out to unrepentant.\n\nChaupat advised that they send for the Superintendent first. As Gobindadeva was listening to the gathering crowd about accusations, the 2 pliss told him to do his worst. So he killed them with his sword.\n\n"My good men, have the bodies displayed on the public square", he told the silent crowd. "Let it be known that the Kingdom of Orissa doesn\'t allow any form of bribery or corruption lest it displease Jagannath, our undying Lord."\n\n"But Saar, you are not in Orissa," cried Chaupat.\n\nGobindadeva ignored him &amp; entered the Desk workshop he\'d spied earlier.\n\nInstead he found dirty dark room with old men working.\n\n"Work faster, you worms" sneered Gobindadeva, "Or have the gods neglected to give you the agility of even a tortoise? Who takes a week to make a desk?"\n\n"Yes, yes", nodded Chaupat as he struck at them with a handy stick. "See how the Imperial liaison is displeased!"\n\nThe old workers begged for mercy &amp; Gobindadeva inspected the workshop &amp; found it was unsanitary, foul, cramped, &amp; with poor tools.\n\nHe felt bad for the workers.\n\n"Here, old fools, take this bag of 20 fanams (a desk cost only half a fanam). It is against my principles to oppress the wretched &amp; suffering, unless I\'m ordered or pressed to. Buy new tools, expand your shop, let in some light- gods, this place is dark. Do this by next week."\n\nAs he was leaving, the oldest man spoke feebly, "But great sir, the window taxes are a fanam a month &amp; an expansion license 20 in itself."\n\n"The WHAT??"\n\nGobindadeva couldn\'t believe his years. "Chaupat, what is this man talking about?"\n\nChaupat mumbled &amp; said he\'ll send a file.\n\nGobindadeva said that he will have Chaupat flogged for a poor memory if he couldn\'t recite the laws verbatim in 30 mins. Or he could have the file delivered to them.\n\nHe then told the Guildshead to bring him a seat, his sons to fan him, &amp; his wife &amp; daughters to make him food.\n\nThe Guildshead said that cumbersome taxes &amp; low ease of business, coupled with the nature of Babudom had led the Andhernagari youth to flee to Orissa, thus leaving only the Old to labour herein.\n\nThe kids in Orissa soon chose to forget about Andhernagari &amp; its crazy laws.\n\nGobindadeva felt bad for the old men. "Ok, get your chicks to make me some tea then. I\'ll fix you guys up soon &amp; your sons can come work with you again," he assured them.\n\n"But saar, being modern, our kids aren\'t allowed to learn carpentry. They learn Andher studies at school."\n\nA confused Gobindadeva demanded an explanation from Chaupat, &amp; learnt that Andhernagari made all kids learn Andher studies which taught them important things like Alcohol Appreciation, Turkish studies, Western Drama, &amp; African Dance theory. They also learnt about Nationalism.\n\n"These make child a wellrounded functioning citizen of Andhernagari who\'s proud of his City," said Chaupat proudly. "We teach them all needed to be a true 12th Century person"\n\n"Do they also teach girls to make tea?" grumbled Gobindadeva. "Get me my tea before I die of thirst".\n\n"No, Saar," said Chaupat &amp; fell silent when he sensed Gobindadeva was reaching for his riding whip.\n\nOldman explained, "Great Imperial Dignitary, Andhernagari girls are encouraged to go for jobs with the City. They..."\n\nHe fell silent. Gobindadeva saw Chaupat glaring at Oldman.\n\n\'How does anyone get tea here\', Gobindadeva wondered as he stepped out of the workshop in a daze, followed closely by a worried-looking Chaupat.\n\nThen he spotted the Turaka selling kebabs at the corner.\n\nHe found a similar Turkish tea stall &amp; began to think as he sipped his Tea.\n\nIn the distant public square, Gobindadeva could spy a crowd around the two corpses he\'d ordered to be strung up.\n\nSome were crying. Others shouting. He heard police ringing the bells customarily mounted on their spears.\n\nChaupat looked worried. "We must go, Saar. Now!"\n\n"We will, Chaupat," Gobindadeva assured him as all around them began to rush to the Public Square where the bodies were being taken down by livid plissmen. "But first you go get me my horse. I left it in that alleyway."\n\nAs Chaupat left, Gobindadeva grabbed the hapless Turaka.\n\nDragging him into dark alley, Gobindadeva threatened Turaka &amp; demanded how he, a mere tea-seller- managed to survive in a City that had schools that taught Nationalism. He offered him 10 fanams if he spoke &amp; death if he didn\'t.\n\nTuraka was impressed at Gobindadeva\'s intelligence.\n\nTuraka &amp; Gobindadeva went to a shady dhaba, where he answered all of Gobindadeva\'s koschans.\n\nHe told Gobindadeva that the healthiest youth joined army &amp; lived in forests, most capable left, &amp; without jobs, others turned feral &amp; wild. Growing Turaka population led to raids\n\nAnd thus though Andhernagari army was strong, the farms emptied out &amp; Turaka ghettos came up. Food shortages were mitigated by government with imported aid.\n\n"That\'s fine", said Gobindadeva curtly. "But how do they pay for all this?"\n\nAnd the Turaka told him.\n\nA tired Chaupat reached his Office with horses in tow. He was angry at Gobindadeva for having vanished. Pliss were livid at the executions &amp; it was by only calling in favours that he\'d managed to escape. Even so, he\'d agreed that he would help then assassinate Gobindadeva soon.\n\nHe found the Office full.\n\nGobindadeva stood there, taking notes from all the girls there. In the corner, some of the Senior officers &amp; ladies lay dead.\n\n"Chaupat, now I\'m aware of everything," said Gobindadeva as he spotted the Andhernagari Babu.\n\n"The reason your office seems to be at the heart of everything- safety regulations, industrial laws, migration etc- is that there are no other offices at all.\n\nThe City produces nothing. You Officers can produce nothing. Only consume. So why have anything save Taxes &amp; Pliss?"\n\n"The reason you seem free-handed &amp; generous despite producing nothing is not only the wealth from your migrants &amp; your tormented peasants, but also the fact that your city has no children.\n\nThe Schools were shut down long ago after everyone consumed your Andher studies Agitprop."\n\nYou\'ve destroyed your trades &amp; uprooted all traditions. Then you preferentially gave women jobs while intentionally denying it to the men, forcing the latter to flee.\n\nThus you lords of Andhernagari turned this city into a Turaka harem for your own pleasures."\n\nTo prevent the populace from rising against you, you set them apart from each other- allowing Turaka to come in, allowing open whoredom as with the girl in the morning, &amp; crushing all who protested as those Pliss in the public square. This you managed by subduing Religion."\n\n"Fool," sneered Chaupat. "All of this is true."\n\n"But what can you do? Your title is hot air. You are young. You killed my friends via surprise. But I still stand &amp; my blades are many."\n\nGobindadeva spoke, "you are unarmed." He raised his sword but was piled upon by the girls.\n\nThe next morning, Gobindadeva was tied to a pole &amp;, in a Kangaroo Court, sentenced to Death by stoning.\n\nChaupat accused him of Murder, the girls accused him of Rape, the Pliss accused him of Treason, the Guildsmen of Gold smuggling, the Turaka of being an Oriya.\n\nHis time was up\n\nAt that moment, the air rang with the blowing of war conches &amp; the shriek of trumpets &amp; of elephants.\n\nThe guards on City walls cried with alarm &amp; fell silent as the whistling of arrows reached a crescendo.\n\n"The gates have fallen!" came the cry- &amp; then Oriya Zamindari Cavalry\n\nThey succoured Gobindadeva, returned his pagri &amp; whip, &amp; brought him before the old &amp; great general Bishnudeva who was the Tormentor of the North.\n\n"Great Lord," said Gobindadeva as he fell to his knees. "I have no words to thank you with. How did you know of &amp; come to my aid?"\n\n"You were saved by mere chance," laughed the great &amp; terrible Lord as his servants held his battered shriveled body up.\n\n"I conspired to send you here since you are earnest &amp; tempestuous &amp; young, &amp; surely would\'ve been mistakenly marked for corruption by this wretched City."\n\n"If you\'d been corrupted, I\'d have held them guilty of crimes against our Bureaucracy, &amp; taken City on a pretext of slaying you.\n\nIf you weren\'t &amp; failed to root out corruption, I\'d have invaded on pretext of punishing your incompetence.\n\nBut invaded I would have, in any case."\n\n"However by your clumsy bungling, you managed to get yourself set up for execution &amp; thus gave me appropriate casus belli to invade. Without my agent, you\'d have been slain though. Alas."\n\n\'Who?\' wondered Gobindadeva, almost delirious with pain. "I know no such agent."\n\nThe General sneered at him. "We do what we do not in pursuit of Virtue or out of the desire for Good, but to enable others without our burdens to seek for the same. It is not to us to be honest or upright or glorious, but to be venal &amp; underhanded &amp; corrupt ourselves."\n\n"This is Kali Yuga. We live in terrible times &amp; must be terrible ourselves or we will be slain."\n\n"Shopkeeper harassed by pliss was my tool. His son was killed for protesting Turaka sellers, his daughter turned into a City departmental whore by the older ladies. He became mine."\n\n"I had him bribe Pliss to establish precedent. I had him bribe the Taxation department to set up Window taxes. I had him pay the Superintendent of Pliss give Chaupat the idea to tempt you with a whore during work. I had him arrange to be beaten up by Pliss."\n\nThus were my deeds.\n\nGobindadeva was awed to tears at the Majesty &amp; Intelligence of the great and terrible General who had offered tens of thousands of heads of the barbarians in front of the eyes of the gods.\n\n"Command me, great Lord," he said. "And I will root out more cities for you!"\n\n"No, child," said the General softly.\n\n"You have been brave and clever. But you were not intelligent. I command you to study the precepts of Bhishma and of the Maurya Minister Chanakya again. And to bring me the head of the one I wish."\n\nThus did Gobindadeva act, and was praised.'<br />Author: 'ZanGayBarn'  id: 'hq96xa'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hq96xa/pls_read_itll_give_you_a_life_lesson/</li>

Even her medical exam is not done yet after 12 days.'<br />Body: "&gt; The 13 year old victim said that she had come to her aunt's home village of Mannaka 20-25 days ago. Here  Hassa alias Pappu Khan, son of her aunt's neighbour Soyab raped her on the pretext of showing her home and made a pornographic video. The young man gave her a mobile, promising to marry her. She later moved back to her village.\n\n&gt;After this, on 30th June, the young man called her on the road outside the village but she refused. On her denial, Pappu Khan threatened to make pornographic videos viral. Afraid of this, she came on the road. From there, the young man and his brother-in-law took her by car to a hotel in Alwar, where they gangraped at night and gave her 50 thousand rupees. Soyab's brother also raped her.\n\n&gt; In morning, they took back the money &amp; kept her kidnapped. The victim's uncle filed a complaint  at the police station on June 30. Despite this, the victim's medical has not been done yet. The accused are also roaming freely. Vicim's family are being pressured to change the statement by threatening to kill them. In such a situation, the working style of Alwar police is once again being questioned. The victim alleges that the police along with the accused are threatening her to change her statement. While police is not arresting the accused. \n\n&gt;At the same time, the argument of the police in this case is also interesting. The police say that the victim had registered a case of kidnapping and during the statement also did not mention any gangrape. Despite this, the police consider both the accused guilty of gangrape. \n\nThe investigation has been handed over to CO Kishangarhbas. The victim can give an application to the DSP to get her medical done. The question arises that when the report filed in the police did not mention it in the gang rape, then how is the police accepting the gang rape! The question is arising from this statement of the police itself, it is engaged in whitewashing in this case. The minor victim alleged that the accused was gangraped for several days by making pornographic videos of her. Even after the registration of the case, the police have not yet got medical done. Instead of gang-rape, a case of kidnapping is registered as misleading. The Kishangarhbas police has not been able to arrest the accused even 10 days after the incident nor has he been given medical treatment.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL P Vijayan, current Kerala CM, was the first accused in the first political murder of a RSS pracharak in Kerala, RamKrishnan, in 1969.'<br />Body: '&gt; "Attacks on Sangh members started in Kerala in 1942. The first murder took place on April 28, 1969. One RSS Mukhya Sikhsak Ramakrishnan was killed. The first accused in that case at that time was a KSYF (then youth wing of CPM) worker, a 19-or 20-year-old P Vijayan. Later on he, Pinarayi Vijayan became Chief Minister of Kerala.\n\n&gt;"Because of lack of evidence and all, the case was not clearly taken up. From that time, murder politics started in Kerala," J Nandakumar, All India Sah-Prachar Pramukh of RSS, told reporters in a briefing after the second day session.\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/kerala-cm-was-involved-sangh-activists-murder-alleges-rss-729505-2016-10-24\n\n&gt;Truth behind the first targeted political murder of Kerala in which present CM Pinarayi Vijayan was the 1st accused: Watch how P Jayarajan, dist sec CPIM Kannur (himself an accused in many cases) openly accepts killing Vadikal Ramakrishnan in 1969.Thus initiating  \'Kannur Model\' of elimination politics.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kumarnandaj/status/955684683387318272?lang=en\n\nThis is why the defumanisation of Hindus &amp; Hindu proponents as bhakhts, ch@ddis &amp; s@nghiis is so popular among the left. If they cease to deserve the status of humans, then no one bats an eye if they are killed. \n\n\nMore details:\n\n&gt; Witnesses who saw the murder of Vadikkal Ramakrishnan on April 28, 1969, in Kannur district of Kerala say that Pinarayi Vijayan was the person who murdered Ramakrishnan, an RSS activist. ‚ÄúI saw Pinarayi Vijayan murdering Ramakrishnan with an ax,‚Äù Umesh who saw the dreaded event told Janam TV, a 24X7 Malayalam news channel on Saturday.\n\nThis was the first recorded political murder of Kerala. More than 200 RSS workers have been brutally murdered by the CPI-M since then though the mainstream media in the state, dominated by Marxist journalists have blacked out such murders from the public eye.\n\nUmesh said he did not reveal this to anyone till now out of fear. Kannur is full of party villages controlled by the CPI-M. People who dare to dissent with the CPI-M leadership are excommunicated from the villages or brutally murdered as a warning to prospective dissenters.\n\nBalakrishnan, another witness, said he rushed to the spot on hearing the wailing and shrieking by Umesh as well as Ramakrishnan. ‚ÄúWhat I saw was a most cruel scene. Ramakrishnan had been hacked and he was bleeding profusely. I saw the mob pushing the body of Ramakrishnan into an autorickshaw owned by one Johny,‚Äù said Balakrishnan. Both Umesh and Balakrishnan were colleagues of Ramakrishnan, a tailor by profession.\n\n‚ÄúI still the remember the face of a young Pinarayi Vijayan, who had an ax with him. There were more than 200 CPI-M workers in the procession led by M V Rajagopalan who had come to murder Ramakrishnan,‚Äù said Balakrishnan.\n\nThough the RSS has been accusing Pinarayi Vijayan for his direct involvement in the murder, the powers that be ensured that no witnesses came out in the open to testify about his involvement. Moreover, Kerala was under Marxist rule during the murder of Ramakrishnan. The then Chief Minister E M S Namboodirippadu had worked overtime to make Pinarayi Vijayan exonerated from the case.\n\nThe Kannur Police had a filed a FIR naming Pinaryi Vijayan and M V Rajagopalan as the prime accused in the case. Rajagopalan was the father-in-law of Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, the present State Secretary of the CPI-M. ‚ÄúIt was Rajagopalan who led the procession of more than 200 persons who had gathered to murder Ramakrishnan,‚Äù said Balakrishnan.\n\nRajagopalan has ben an accused in many murders which took place in Kannur district and had been sentenced by the lower court in many instances but came out thanks to the appeals filed by him and the CPI-M in the higher courts.\n\nhttps://www.pgurus.com/pinarayi-vijayan-the-prime-accused-in-keralas-first-political-murder/\n\nJust a month back, Mohammed Hashim, convicted for the murder of RSS worker Suresh Babu, was also spotted as revered guest at the wedding of Kerala CM\'s daughter. \n\nHow is this different from the recent diktat of terrorists in Kashmir to Kashmiris to stop being RSS &amp; BJP members or face killing of them &amp; their family like Wasim Bari?\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2020/06/mohammed-hashim-convict-rss-worker-murder-suresh-wedding-kerala-cm-daughter-riyas/'<br />Author: 'Jorg_RedAncrath'  id: 'hpv7r4'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hpv7r4/til_p_vijayan_current_kerala_cm_was_the_first/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Solution for COVID-19 Pandemic'<br />Body: " \n\n**SUGGESTED SOLUTION :**\n\nAs we know that the world is currently going through this pandemic, I came up with a small idea to resume our normal lives asap without waiting for the vaccine. I know I am not an expert but just want to share my idea, and I'd like if you can correct any flaws in my ideology and share it to others if you find it really working. So my plan goes like this :----\n\nAll the movement needs to be ceased (a strict lockdown), and if anyone has to go out due to any rare situation, then they should have a quick check and then only allowed to go. ***People will have to understand and stop all outgoing activities.***\n\nNow in a subdivision of a block of a district, we'll have a team of pathologists (preferably those who are in that area ) who can perform covid-19 live tests (on the spot) and also some policemen, and they'll do mass testing. It needs so many testing kits so the govt. should start mass production 1 month prior to it. They'll target every house and go and check. An antibody test takes around 25-30 mins for result, and we'll have multiple tests running simultaneously by every team in their locality, if the team works in day-night shifts for all 24hrs. and ***the people cooperate with the team,*** then all of the people could be checked more quickly (around a fortnight) and those who tested POSITIVE can be taken to the quarantine centre for treatment, and once all those are taken to the centre, then all those remaining will be allowed to resume the normal life asap.\n\n**AN EXAMPLE FOR DEMONSTRATION**\n\nNow comes a real life example using some maths : West Delhi is one of the 11 total districts of Delhi, with a population of over 25.4 lakh people (25,40,000). Now lets suppose we have plenty of test kits and around **testers** who can perform the test (including the pathologists, people in lab who know like lab assistant and also **we can train some more people for the job of testing thus providing some employment in these hard times**). If they work in some shift arrangement and are able to work for 24hrs. then in one day they can test = 24\\*60 \\*1.5\\*1000. Same for other days and eventually all the 25.4 lakh can be tested in only 12-13 days. I know continue 24hrs. test is not possible and also some other aspects but then also in around 3 weeks we will all be tested and can resume the normal lives.\n\nAnd this test would be simultaneously run in all other districts of Delhi, so at the maximum after a month, the whole of Delhi can resume to normal life again.\n\n**SOME KEY CONCERNS :**\n\n1. **The people will have to fully cooperate during this period. They will have to understand that just keeping shut in their houses for this time of 2-3 weeks will allow them to resume their normal lives in a month (rather than waiting for a vaccine or something till 2021).**\n2. **Govt. will have to provide the houses with food and all requirements for this strict home lockdown for 2-3 weeks so that they won't have to go out for some basic necessities.**\n3. **Training of some people selected for testing and the manufacturing of large no. of testing kits is to be done in advance.**\n4. **People found** ***POSITIVE*** **should not panic and run away from the houses or from the hospital. It is for their well-being only as they can get well soon with the proper medication. This takes us to the fact that govt. should strictly check all the hospitals and the way treatment of patients is done.**\n5. **Don't let you greed come in between, no type of corruption should be there, like bribing some to give fake reports or giving a** ***NEGATIVE*** **report without even testing. PLEASE understand the current condition, you can do whatever amount you want to bribe, but not this time. PLEASE !!!**\n\nNow, the whole world is suffering from this condition just due to the negative aspects and wrong-doings of the human being like poaching, killing animal, animal cruelty, etc. Its time we define ourselves and show some humanity. If you have just 1% of even a 1% of humanity, then please absolutely follow these 5 points of concern, because we cannot win alone, we need the support of all, and most importantly, we need the people with their ***HUMANITY*** ***!!!!***"<br />Author: 'Anantaniium'  id: 'hpudvs'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hpudvs/solution_for_covid19_pandemic/</li>

      <li>Title::: '(Rant) For a country so heavily invested - politically, mentally, and emotionally - into Gods and Goddesses, we are remarkably casual about doling out divine status to fellow earthly human beings'<br />Body: 'It starts right from when we\'re young, with our parents being called our first gods for bringing us into this world. Growing up, we\'re taught that \'mehmaan bhagwaan hota hai\'. And then when you\'re married, there\'s the \'Tujh mein rab dikhta hai\' sort of mentality between partners. And of course, cows.\n\nMy point is this - why do you want to color normal human beings with the same God-like adjectives when describing them, when you clearly know that people are flawed? It\'s not like everyone who considers their parents or partners as Gods has never found faults or disagreements with them at some point. So either your concept of Godliness is flawed (that they\'re flawless) or you\'re just doling out God status to anyone along the road, which then just goes back to show how shallow your concept of Gods is, bringing your entire concept of God itself, crashing down to the ground.\n\nThe related problem to this is hero worship. We worship people we love. There\'s this line in the movie Birdman which struck me as relevant here - "We always confuse love with admiration." You like someone\'s performance, sure that\'s great, but don\'t kid yourself into thinking you should admire everything about them. They\'re human beings, and they\'re flawed. They\'re exceptionally good at one, two, or even hundred different things. But there\'ll always be something they\'re not good at, or not perfect at. And it\'s not wrong when someone points out that 101st thing which your hero actually sucked at - it could be a horrific moral stand they took, or displayed a questionable belief about a certain sect of people, or worse murdered or ran over people in their car in the night. You only get offended because you boxed your hero into the hundred things that you loved about them, and somehow that\'s all that was needed for them to be a God in your book.\n\nAnd what\'s worse is this god-like, devoid-of-responsibility perception goes to the heads of those who are worshipped. It\'s no more \'they couldn\'t have done that\' but \'because it\'s they who did it, it must be right\'. Our \'heroes\' can\'t be seen talking like normal people or hanging out and doing daily shit like others. I cringe at those interviews and videos where the description goes something like "We sat down with the star himself at his mansion and we were surprised to find that deep down, XYZ, who made 100cr at the box office last week is just a normal human being like the rest of us." Well, what did you expect to find, you numbnut? Then you\'d think that to get genuine responses and cut out the feeling of being overwhelmed by stardom and heroes, let\'s get someone equally popular and overwhelming to conduct the interview, but then you get the shit Akshay Kumar did with Modi about which side up he likes his mangoes thrust in.\n\nWhy do we have to worship anyone at all? Especially in our country where we already worship some entities like gods and goddesses as flawless (already questionable, but we\'ll let that pass for now), it is so highly irresponsible to accord the same status to normal humans. Your mind instantly makes a connection and absolves the human being of any criticism because in your head, they have the same place as Gods. Our desire to be subservient and obsequious to a higher power - be it man, woman, or even God - is plain sick.'<br />Author: 'vishalshah2017'  id: 'hptohs'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hptohs/rant_for_a_country_so_heavily_invested/</li>

What about muslims ?\n\nWe are NOT ALLOWING just about anybody from Bangladesh. People who will be benefiting from CAA are those already living within INDIA before December 2014.\n\n\n4) What about Rohingyas ?\n\nAre they related to partition of India ? Their issue has to be dealt separately. Not through CAA.\n\n\n5) What about muslims from other countries ?\n\nThey still get to apply for citizenship through regular channels. Same as any non-muslim who might enter the country in the future. Since their ( muslims seeking citizenship ) numbers is comparatively too less it doesn't make any sense to give them citizenship through a classification.\n\nAnd Baloch demand a separate country not Indian citizenship.\n\nRest muslim groups are very less in numbers and hence can be dealt on an individual basis rather than based on any classification.\n\n\n6) Isn't CAA anti-constitution ?\n\nNo. Becaus govt is targetting a specific group through classification. Muslim groups are not being violated of their rights to get Indian citizenship if they apply.\n\nIt's like UK not extending citizenship to persecuted Tibetans / Uighurs but still Tibetans / Uighurs can apply if they want.\n\n\n7) I oppose NRC only because it is dangerous along with CAA.\n\nNRC has not been tabled yet. Home Minister had said it will be done after CAA. But will those benefited through CAA will be involved or if CAA will even be linked to NRC is not known as of today.

The Brahmin Chetna Parishad, Prasada said, would act as a platform to hear the problems faced by the community, and help them ‚Äúfind solutions‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe want to reach out to Brahmins across professions ‚Äî lawyers, doctors, teachers. Listen to their woes, be their voice, and help find solutions for them,‚Äù he said.\n\nAs usual, Shekhar Gupta agrees to dividing along caste lines, Shekhar Gupta says Brahmin mafia exists in UP because Brahmins lean on them &amp; that Yogi is targeting Brahmin mafia &amp; Brahmins.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MihirkJha/status/1281886801418838016\n\n&gt;As soon as the manhunt to nab the notorious gangster Vikas Dubey began in Uttar Pradesh, there were reports that Congress party was attempting to use WhatsApp groups to paint the Yogi Government as ‚Äòanti-brahmin‚Äô.\n\n&gt;In Rajasthan, the Congress party used the death of Anandpal Singh in an encounter to woo the Rajput community. The slain gangster‚Äôs daughter, Yogita Singh, was deployed by the Congress party to play the sympathy card in its bid to secure the votes of the Rajput community. Yogita Singh, while addressing a program under the chairmanship of District President Keshar Singh, Ravana Rajput, in Sujangarh Ravana Rajput Sabha building on Sunday, blamed the BJP government for the death of her father.\n\n&gt;The said program was attended by various Congress leaders, including Congress nominee Bhawarlal Meghwal. In Uttar Pradesh, ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections, it was widely speculated that the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party had not formed an alliance with the Congress party in order to split the Upper Caste vote in the state. However, that did not work as the BJP managed to secure over 60 out of the 80 seats in the state.\n\n&gt;It is also to be remembered that poll strategist Prashant Kishore had advised the Congress party to project either Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi or a Brahmin as the Chief Ministerial candidate in Assembly Elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Consequently, senior leader Sheila Dixit had been declared the party‚Äôs Chief Ministerial candidate. That was before the Congress party decided to dump the strategy and went ahead with an alliance with the Samajwadi Party.\n\nIn a different news, Congress-Left supported platforms continue promoting "smash brahminical patriarchy" in every second line, refer to Hinduism as brahminical religion &amp; just 3 months back, Congress-controlled Rajasthan HC ruled that "smash brahminical patriarchy is not hurting the sentiments of Brahmins. And 2 weeks back, in Rajasthan,  a Brahmin father was found hanging after he refused to take back rape complaints of his minor daughter against Meo Muslim family. \n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/politics/in-alwar-a-meo-muslim-family-is-accused-of-molesting-a-minor-hindu-girl-and-killing-her-father-the-media-looks-away-the-mla-turns-a-blind-eye\n\n&gt;Instead of acting against the molesters, a cop, belonging to the same religion as them, shames the girl in front of her family. He calls the girl ‚Äúloose‚Äù. The police drag the matter for two days before eventually filing a case under pressure.\n\n&gt;On the morning of the day when the girl is scheduled to give her statement to the magistrate, her father is found hanging from a tree near the house. Forget the media, not even the local MLA Shafia Khan has bothered to contact the aggrieved family. Shafia, from the Congress Party, is wife of Zubair Khan, a three-time MLA from the Ramgarh Assembly constituency.\n\nLong live congress lovers &amp; long live congress media.'<br />Author: 'Jorg_RedAncrath'  id: 'hp8d5q'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hp8d5q/congress_declares_itself_as_brahmin_savior_in_up/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Thoughts on Vikas Dubey case'<br />Body: ' \n\nAs someone from the region, I‚Äôd like to share few thoughts on the entire episode. No, these aren‚Äôt some hidden stories that hitherto have eluded the public narrative, but more as a commentary on present socio-political discourse of the state.\n\nFew things first-\n\n1. A criminal has a finite life cycle. So while it is important to realize the moment to seize opportunity to ride the coattails of power echelons, equally vital is to know when you are beat‚Äîthat is, to understand when your ‚Äòservices‚Äô are no longer useful. Failure to realize this ensure that the cold confines of the morgue is the only destiny of the said criminal, with how many body part remain intact being the only variation.\n2. Yes, criminal has a finite life cycle, but not the crime. It will remain till the time power struggle, and in turn humanity, remains. Truth be told, some people are needed to enter the underbelly of the society, just as sanitation workers are needed to clean the sewer beneath the beautiful cozy societies.\n3. But these underbelly dealing can often be ugly, to the society that is increasingly been softened by the easy technology fueled lifestyle. After all, the last thing the powers that be need for these dealings going wrong out in the open, resulting in gore, splattered brains and entrails, and thus the PTSDs in masses. So you need intelligent methods of power struggles, dealings and negotiations, bait, buy and sell and what not‚Äîto minimize the sordidity in the open. As an example, watch this video to understand how these things happen-- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yttc5-3KG0)\n4. Lastly, order is very important for the society to function. Yes, chaos are important at times for the Khadi-Tie (politician-businessman) but in a controlled fashion. To be honest, a lot of drama is controlled, events managed (and sometimes staged) for several reasons. Funnily, even Societies need some Masala to function, as too much ‚Äòstability‚Äô can lead to depression‚ÄîDenmark, Iceland, I am looking at you. De-escalation ramp is managed so that everyone has something to gain. And this holds true for small time politician-mafia-business nexus gone wrong, to larger geopolitical tussle such as the current India-China face off. After all, what is the use if things go uncontrolled to the point of no return? Instability is good for none.\n\n(Contd. in comments)'<br />Author: 'PaKtionablevidence'  id: 'hp5kl1'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hp5kl1/thoughts_on_vikas_dubey_case/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'My grandmother passed away from Covid a few days back. Here is her story'<br />Body: 'My family is still in shock and I am not sure how I\'m going to handle this but I hope her story gives light to the entire situation right now and maybe it could shed some light. An actual story that hasn\'t been marred by politics or sensationalism of the news.\n\nIn mid June my grandmother of almost 80 had to be rushed to a hospital because she suffered a stroke. They did her covid test of her and she came out to be negative. My uncle was there to help her and take her to the hospital he had also tested negative for covid.\n\nA few days after getting discharged she was facing breathing problems and again she was rushed to one hospital. She was rejected from the first hospital who treated her for the stroke and so she was shifted to another one. There it was found out she was Covid positive. After a day my uncle went to the hospital to get checked and he too was Covid positive. \n\nTreatment was going on just fine and both were stable. My grandmother has lung issues and so she was on the ventilator. She was later on shifted to another hospital which has a more specialised Covid ICU. My uncle meanwhile was trying to manage everything. On the same day my uncle was supposed to get discharged my mother gets a call that my grandmothers oxygen levels were critically low. \n\nWhile my uncle was busy with the paperwork we were frantically asking for the updates from anywhere and everywhere. Somewhere around 4.40ish I see my mother breaking down over a phone call. My grandmother had passed away. We were too late. My grandmother used to live quite far away with my uncle (her son). And my uncle had to go again and get all the paperwork sorted out again. The last I saw of my grandmother was her body in a body bad and being cremated over a video call from my uncle. That was the last a son saw of his mother.\n\nDuring these 8-9 days my family has been extremely stressed. I had tried to learn where to get the medical Covid forms because the family doctor wasn\'t cooperative. We have had to deal with rude authorities who are stressed out. We had to deal with horrible management that wasn\'t willing to give my grandmother hospital gowns and basically telling us to buy gowns for her to use everyday. We had dealt with an incident where she had her jaw dislocated because the ventilator strap was too tight. And at the end we had to hunt for Remdesivir and call every contact we knew because the hospital only had the really expensive variety that was like 40,000 an injection rather than the intended price of one which was much cheaper but never in stock. Btw the people who were supposed to collect samples of the other family members living in that house came after a week and then it turned out my aunty was asymptomatic. Luckily she was only given home quarantine. \n\nThis virus is not a joke. This virus is not a reason for someones poltics. This virus kills regardless. I remember the coldness of loosing one grandmother to cancer and I couldn\'t do anything and recently I feel that coldness again. A coldness that breaks you and a pain that rots your very soul. My grandmothers are in a better place now. My grandmother is just one number in a statistic and that\'s okay for me. I don\'t know what to feel anger against the doctors, hate for not being fast enough or just sadness.\n\nPlease before you post  rather unsubstantiated stat over "actual" Covid facts or actual infection rates, please please please check your sources. It goes both ways. People are still having wounds to heal and you could be considerate. My grandmother didn\'t die for any person\'s politics. Please wear a face mask. It not for you it\'s for others. And please don\'t spread hate and anger over this to anyone. All don\'t know what to do and yet people are trying their best to work something out.'<br />Author: 'abbawaddadu'  id: 'hov7n3'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hov7n3/my_grandmother_passed_away_from_covid_a_few_days/</li>

Although there are countries which has taken very strict decisions to control the virus and some has made the condition worst by their decision making.\n\n\nNow,let's look on the performance of different countries on controlling this virus.Nearly, every country around the globe has seen its impact so its impossible to track every country that's why I have chosen the countries having\xa0more than 60,000 cases.I have found\xa025 affected\xa0countries having cases more than 60,000 and chosen them to show their performance till now to the common people around the world.I am trying to show the level of concern of respective government for their common countrymen and the level of responsibility of common people towards their respective government and country.\n\n\nI have ignored the\xa0China\xa0totally because they have disclosed the wrong data of patients.Although we know that more than\xa021 million\xa0mobiles has been found switched off in China and yet they shown cases nearly around 83000 which is totally baseless.If we consider 21 million deaths then just the number of affected cases,it should at least cross 200 million which is higher than the affected cases across whole world .\n\n\nNow this is based on the implementation of plan of the respective government to stop spreading of this disease in their population.So this rankings is strictly based on the\xa0percentage of population affected\xa0but not on the number of affected cases or number of deaths because for a country having less population is easy to control whereas large number of people can cause drastic increase which is very difficult to control.So the percentage of population affected is the best method to rank the country to show their planning and its implementation to stop the spread of Corona disease.Now to make it more clear,country having least percentage of population affected has done well and implemented their plans nicely will be ranked 1st\xa0and\xa0country having highest percentage of population affected has got some loop wholes in either in their planning or its implementation is ranked last.And this rankings this just\xa0based on the data till 00:40 am of 28 June\xa0(only\xa0till present scenerio and not taking account of future, please stop ......because it is irrespective of peak has came or not and when it will come).Now the ranking is as follows............\n\n\n25.\xa0QATAR\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nQatar\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdul Aziz Al Thani (Prime Minister)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0Monarchy\n\nPopulation :-\xa028,07,805 (approx 28 lakhs)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa093,663\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa03.34 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa077,225\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa082.4 %\n\nDeath :-\xa0110\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 0.1 %\n\n\n*\xa0COVID-19\xa0arrived in\xa0Qatar\xa0on\xa027 February 2020\xa0as its first confirmed case was seen.Qatar has found to be on\xa0last rank\xa0(25th)\xa0as it has got\xa0highest percentage of population affected\xa0in the world with\xa03.34 %\xa0of affected people.The governing body is working by locking down the country and cutting off Areas with migrant workers but it is not working properly as the spread around the country is very vast.Despite of having very less population,its vast spread it highly questionable.Although it has got highest percentage of population affected but it has the\xa0least number of deaths (110)\xa0,low death rate (approx 0.1 %)\xa0and the\xa0recovery rate\xa0is also\xa0quite high (82.4 %)\xa0which is highly commendable.\n\n\n\n24.\xa0CHILE\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nChile\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Sebastian Pinera (President)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0Mixed Government\n\nPopulation :-\xa01,91,14,153 (approx 1.91 Cr)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa02,67,766\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa01.4 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa02,28,055\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa085.2 %\n\nDeath :-\xa05,347\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 2 %\n\n\n*\xa0\xa0First case\xa0of\xa0COVID-19\xa0was confirmed in\xa0Chile\xa0on\xa03 March 2020.It is found to be the\xa0second worst country\xa0and ranked\xa024th\xa0on this list as it has affected nearly\xa01.4 %\xa0population of the country which way more for a country having lesser than the moderate population.The governing body and the common people should be responsible for the vast spread of disease around the country as didn't apply the preventive measure at the correct time.The\xa0death rate\xa0is around\xa02 %\xa0and\xa0recovery rate\xa0is\xa085.2\xa0% which is good.\n\n\n23.\xa0PERU\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nPeru\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Martin Vizcarra (President)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0Mixed Government\n\nPopulation :-\xa03,29,64,854 (approx 3.29 Cr)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa02,72,364\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa00.83 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa01,59,809\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa054.1 %\n\nDeath :-\xa08,939\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 3 %\n\n\n* Arrival of\xa0COVID-19\xa0in\xa0Peru\xa0was confirmed on\xa06 March 2020.From then it has spread so rapidly that it had infected\xa0\xa00.83\xa0% of the country's population which is very high for any country having population of around\xa03.3 Crores.With that statistics,Peru\xa0lies on\xa023rd rank\xa0of this list which means it is\xa03rd worst country\xa0in preventing their people from this infectious virus.On 15th March,the President announced complete lockdown across the country and further announced\xa0states emergency till 30th June 2020\xa0but still not getting the preferable result.With\xa0recovery rate\xa0of\xa054.1\xa0% and\xa0low death rate\xa0of\xa0around 3 %,they are just decreasing the effect of Coronavirus in their mind but not in real.\n\n\n22.\xa0UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nUnited States of America\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Donald Trump (President)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0The Republican Party (Grand Old Party)\n\nPopulation :-\xa033,09,81,104 (approx 33 Cr)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa025,81,719\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa00.78 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa010,71,438\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa041.5 %\n\nDeath :-\xa01,27,968\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 5%\n\n\n*\xa0Confirmation of\xa0first Corona positive\xa0case comes on\xa013 January 2020\xa0and after then it has caused havoc in this most developed country of the world.More than\xa02.5 Million\xa0case has been found which contributes\xa00.78 %\xa0of the total population of the country and\xa0ranked 22nd\xa0in this list.President Donald Trump announced\xa0public health emergency\xa0on\xa031 January 2020\xa0and said that the threat is under control but it was just a myth.It was the most prepared country for this disease and but it is most affected country from this virus in the world.With high number of cases its\xa0low recovery rate (41.5 %)\xa0and\xa0high death rate (around 5%)\xa0made the condition worst for the common people and the government.\n\n\n21.\xa0BELARUS\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nBelarus\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Alexander Lukashenko (President)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0Mixed Government\n\nPopulation :-\xa094,49,348 (approx 94.5 lakhs)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa061,095\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa00.65 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa044,126\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa072.2 %\n\nDeath :-\xa0377\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 0.5 %\n\n\n*\xa0In\xa0Belarus,the\xa0first confirmed case\xa0of COVID-19 was registered on\xa028 February 2020.It is again very disappointing to note that a country with very less population\xa0(approx 95 lakhs)\xa0was unable to control the spread of this disease.In March,the President itself dismissed the threat of COVID-19 and encouraged the workers to work specially in villages,this decision led them to got the infection spread to\xa00.65 %\xa0of their country's population which make them to land on\xa021st position\xa0out of\xa025\xa0countries.Their government decision made them to pay price by getting high number of affected case but luckily the\xa0death rate\xa0is\xa0very low (around 0.5 %)\xa0and\xa0recovery\xa0rate\xa0is\xa0quite good (72.2 %)\xa0can give them some relief.\n\n\n20.\xa0SWEDEN\xa0\xa0\n\nÔøº\n\nSweden\n\n\n\nHead Of The Government :-\xa0Stefan Lofven (Prime Minister)\n\nRuling Government :-\xa0Mixed Government\n\nPopulation :-\xa01,00,98,554 (approx 1 Cr)\n\nCorona Cases :-\xa065,137\n\n% Of Population Affected :-\xa00.64 %\n\nRecovered Cases :-\xa0NA\n\nRecovery Rate :-\xa0NA\n\nDeath :-\xa05,280\n\nDeath Rate :-\xa0around 8 %\n\n\n*\xa0The arrival of\xa0Coronavirus\xa0was confirmed in\xa0Sweden\xa0on\xa031 January 2020.Again the negligence of the government has cause a great spread of the disease thought out the country.It is also a very small country with population of around\xa01 Crore\xa0but with spread in\xa00.64 %\xa0population of the country made them to land on\xa020th position\xa0which shows the irresponsible behavior of government because they never imposed lockdown instead they tried to apply social distancing and the result is quite dangerous.Their\xa0death rate\xa0is\xa0around 8 %\xa0which is quite high and this will lead to\xa0 increase the tension of medical supervisors\n\n\n\nFor knowing India ranking ,..........[read

I mean we used to have writers like Maithili Sharan Gupt who wrote immortal poems like Pushp Ki Abhilasha and then we have these. Why do all Indian writers are leftist? Why do educated and eminent people hate right wing?

      <li>Title::: 'Western media obsession with Indian rapes'<br />Body: 'This rape hysteria found in both the Indian and Foreign media is part of the **demonization** agenda. Yes, the Indian (English) media is a part of the same machinery. Most people don\'t realize it, but Indian media (English) is controlled by a highly **Anglicized-Anglophile-Anglophone** class of "native" collaborators/informants who inherited their position during colonial times. Due to Gandhi and his stance on non-violence, when the British left India, Indians did not violently destroy these institutions of power controlled by the collaborators who internalized the superiority of their former masters.\n\nI have come to observe that there are 3 methods employed by White people (and their folly "coolie" allies) to reduce the power/influence/confidence of non-Whites:\n\n(1) **Demonization (Backwardness/Misogyny)**\n\n(2) **Feminization (Emasculation)**\n\n(3) **Weirdization (Goofy/Creepy/Foreign)**\n\nThese 3 methods (which can often overlap) are used to reinforce White hegemony all over the world. Anyone who stands in the way or calls out this power structure will be reduced to be one of these. As China\'s economy grew/grows, it\'s Government (and Institutions of Power) was/is attacked and demonized. As India grows, attacking its Government is more difficult for "democracy-loving" Westerners. They will therefore attack its people and its culture: reduce its men to rapist-emasculated-goofy-creeps with "funny" accents.\n\nThose of you living in the West might ask why this matters. Does it matter to you? It matters because one\'s motherland (or ancestor\'s motherland) is often (almost always) used to stereotype. You can never escape it, irrelevant of how much cream you apply to rub that color off. If the average Indian in India is portrayed as a rapist brute, that undercurrent of thought will always be in their heads. They will knowingly or unknowingly apply it to you as well. It matters because this is a very clever White **"LIEBERAL"** way of imposing their hegemony over the rest of the world. At least, White conservatives are direct about their intentions.\n\nThere is so much more I want to write, but I will have to do it in my own post. I haven\'t even started on how Academia (the so-called "intellectuals") play a major role in this, something this forum hasn\'t really discussed. So much to write.\n\nTLDR They\'re trying to reinforce the image of a dirty/loser/abusive/unshaven indian man.

      <li>Title::: 'LAC Clashes &amp; Indian Defence- A Young Officer‚Äôs Perspective and Rant'<br />Body: 'A little bit about myself first. I am a young officer in the Indian Navy. I joined the Navy, trained for a while, and then took a break to get my Bachelor‚Äôs degrees in Electrical Engineering, Robotics Engineering, and Mechatronics Engineering, after which I came back to finish my training and serve. I have worked side-by-side with army personnel on multiple operations/assignments, from Siachen and Pangong (XIV Corps) to Counter Insurgency ops. with the RR. I am writing this post partially to correct some misconceptions that people seem to have based on the posts I have read on this sub and partially as a frustrated rant.\n\n* **Galwan-** There were claims made that the infrastructure in the region is very poor. The Sub-Sector North (Darbuk‚ÄìShyok‚Äì Daulat Beg Oldie) Road is an all-weather road that lies about 4.5-5km west of the LAC. The mud ‚Äòroad‚Äô from the confluence of the Galwan River and Shyok river to PP14, 15 and 17a is not great, the very last bit isn‚Äôt even motorable. The Chinese side has a mud road right up to the LAC but their road often gets flooded and the nearest all-weather road on their side is over 40km away. Till now the LAC in this place was considered settled, and is located about 150m      South-east of where the Galwan river is fed by a stream (Look at a map of the region).\n   * **What disengagement and de-escalation if no one is currently on our soil?** It is possible. Disengagement is when both sides are asked to move back a bit to create a buffer zone so that a sudden disagreement doesn‚Äôt start a physical fight. De-escalation is a more long-winded process that usually involves decreasing troops and arms in the region. \n   * **Were Chinese troops on our soil?** I would believe the official army version over what is being put out by reporters with ‚Äòsources‚Äô they don‚Äôt want to name.\n   * **What do the current de-escalation plans mean?** Both sides are supposed to move back by 2km from the LAC. \n* **Pangong Tso-** It is over 8 hours away from Galwan by road. The Northern bank of the lake has 8 prominent ridges (fingers). No. 1 being on our side and No.8 on the Chinese side. The perception of the LAC here is not the same for both sides. Our claim is all the way up to finger 8 while the Chinese claim is at finger 2. The Indian army used to regularly patrol up to fingers 5-6 along the banks of the lake at which point Chinese patrols would intercept. Last year an Indian patrol managed to make it all the way up to finger 8 by going along the heights of the ridges instead of the banks. The Chinese built a road to finger 4 and asphalted it in 2004,  recently India too built a road up to Finger 3. Early this year China started to build up camps between fingers 4 and 5 and put up what seems to be a small jetty-like structure on the eastern face of finger 4. Both      sides ended up with an entire battalion strength on either side of finger 4.\n   * **Was there an intrusion?** Well, both India and China were sitting in the exact middle of a region that both sides claimed.\n   * **What would be a suitable pullback?** Both sides go back to where they were in April. That is, China at Finger 8 and India at Finger 2\n* It gives me absolutely no pleasure to write this part. Col. Ajai Shukla (Retd) has been regularly quoted by news organisations that refused to believe the Indian Army. From the time he has retired and become a journalist he has consistently criticized the army as a whole and several decorated generals specifically. Till 2014 his articled were focused on how ‚Äòpoor‚Äô the army leadership and decision making was. Some justified criticism and some pot-shot taking. After 2014 he shifted all the blame on the political leadership. His attempts to constantly criticize the forces and politicize border security issues have rubbed several serving and retired officers the wrong way. The utter glee with which he claimed India had been invaded and his silly gotchas by misquoting people certainly hasn‚Äôt helped us. (Again, Col. Shukla is a senior officer and I respect his rank, unfortunately I think he could have handled this whole thing with far more dignity and maturity.)\n* Possible reasons for the sudden aggression from China-\n   * The Border Roads Organisation- There has been a significant increase, ([doubling](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/indias-spending-on-lac-roads-has-tripled-in-4-years/articleshow/76803235.cms)) in speed at which strategic access roads have been built in the last 3 years. (2017-2020). The Sub-sector North road specifically will significantly improve India‚Äôs ability to quickly move resources to the forward regions along the LAC and this was likely seen as a threat.\n   * India‚Äôs Naval dominance over the Indian Ocean- Over the last 5 years several important deals have been signed. \n      * Russia:  Agreement on Reciprocal Logistics Support (ARLS)- Allows India to use all Russian ports for logistics and refuelling.\n      * United States: Logistics Exchange Memoranda of Agreement (LEMOA)- Similar deal with the Americans. Gives India Access to Naval facilities on Diego Garcia.\n      * Australia (Cocos Island- surveillance and eventually a full naval base).\n      * Mauritius - Coastal Surveillance Radar (CSR) station.\n      * Seychelles (leased Assumption Island)- port building, usage and CSR station.\n      * Singapore (Changi Naval Base ‚Äì logistical support and refuelling).\n      * Naval ships sent to the Philippines (South China Sea)- anti-submarine Corvette and GMS Frigate. \n* What could and will probably be done now? \n   * Occupy strategic heights till the winter when the Chinese will almost certainly retreat, reinforce all sensitive areas with light artillery and troops and increase patrolling especially in late March- early April. \n   * Speed up work on Sub-sector north road, complete it before the winter hits.\n   * Permanent Naval installation on the western half of Pangong Tso with rapid response       capabilities.\n   * Maintain pressure on the Naval blockading front, keep plans to cut-off Chinese access to the Indian Ocean. We can only negotiate with a country like China from a position of strength. A position of strength being one from which China will have to pay a heavy price (economic or human) to push us back. \n   * **Demarcation?**  Probably not going to happen any time soon. China has to be willing to have a conversation about finalising borders, at this point they have no motivation to settle it. Maybe extending Indian claim lines regularly in a retaliatory fashion while sending in regular patrols on their side of Aksai Chin will convince them that we‚Äôre serious about wanting to set definite boundaries.\n   * **Do we have any friendly countries that will help?** Uhh, not really. But China has a lot of enemies that will be more than happy to help us/distract them. It‚Äôs the enemy-of-an-enemy sort of relationship more than a friendship. We can only expect help in the form of weaponry and logistical support, no country would be willing to put boots on the ground\n* Kashmir Insurgency, Terrorism and Pakistan- All Kashmiris bad or All Kashmiris good, army/CRPF bad. These seem to be the only two groups of beliefs. The reality is far more nuanced. A few hundred trained Pakistani terrorists cross over the border every year but they aren‚Äôt the only problem. Local politicians, motivated and financed by external sources help radicalise the impressionable youth by deliberately spreading false narratives against the army, CRPF and even the J&amp;K Police. Intelligence given to us by the common Kashmiri people is the backbone of our counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency activities and this is something that isn‚Äôt commonly known in the rest of the country. The news only focuses on the 7-8 thousand angry, protesting Kashmiri people in the valley region around Srinagar. Stone pelters are often portrayed as these saints who simply want ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô. Here is something you might not know. Very often when      terrorists are cornered/surrounded, they call on stone pelters to provide a distraction so that they can escape. The media either paints all Kashmiris with a broad brush calling them all pro-pakistan terrorists or they claim that all residents of Kashmir object to the ‚Äòoppressive‚Äô Indian ‚Äòoccupying forces‚Äô. The common people of Kashmir are caught in the middle of this mess. Their wants and needs are much the same as the rest of ours, an education for their kids, good jobs, some entertainment and a peaceful life. The politicians have robbed them of this for the last several      decades. Will it improve now? Hopefully now that the royalty has been sidelined normalcy will return.\n* Crazy war mongering and calls for invasion- I have noticed calls to use Bhramos and Agni to nuke China. Really? That‚Äôs absolutely fucking ridiculous! (Pardon my French) You must be on some really potent hallucinogens or you‚Äôre absolutely delusional. Anything of that sort will certainly start a      full-blown nuclear war that‚Äôll end up in the destruction of the entire Asian continent. There are no winners in a nuclear war between two countries that have second strike capabilities. Casual war mongerers-  Guess who gets killed first every time there is a border skirmish or limited war? That‚Äôs right, young officers like me and my brothers who lead from the front, not you wankers sitting in your balconies/verandas sipping coffee and spurting verbal diarrhoea on twitter and reddit. Come with us to the front lines and see what its really like! We‚Äôll make a special cannon fodder battalion just for you guys.\n* A few weeks from now if there are no further disturbances, the news media and the common people will forget all about it and everyone will go back to their normal lives. The ‚Äòdefence strategy experts‚Äô and ‚Äòsatellite map reading experts‚Äô will turn into experts on cricket and economics. We will      still remain at the borders, freezing our nuts off and keeping our eyes peeled for the Chinese or Pakistanis. There is a serious disconnect between the ‚Äòintellectual-elite‚Äô middle- and upper-income people living comfortable lives in the far-away cities and the troops on the borders. A vast majority of our Jawans, NCOs and Officers come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The people who lead comfortable lives in cities seldom allow (let alone encourage) their kids to join the armed forces and that really needs to change. Both my parents were college professors and were not too pleased about my decision to join the Navy. This disconnect between the intellectual diaspora in the country and the guys fighting to protect the country is clearly visible in the way news coverage is heavily skewed against the armed forces. \n\nStill, fauji hai hum aur Bharat ke seema surakshit rakhna hamara farz hai, zarurat padhe toh jaan bhi de denge, par peeche nahi hatenge.\n\nJai Hind! \n\nFeeling patriotic?

Uber took the lead when the draft of the cab aggregators policy was being discussed last year. The NITI Aayog, while in principle, endorsed Uber‚Äôs view in its recommendations, has been slightly conservative about its implementation, citing issues like employment and altering the definition of a commercial vehicle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Ola bypassed the NITI Aayog to approach the ministry directly and take its EV mandate forward.  In May 2017, Bengaluru-based cab aggregator Ola launched a pilot of its electric vehicles project in Nagpur.\n\n**#**  **Extending itself far beyond the role it was originally conceived for**\n\n&gt;In the aftermath of the government‚Äôs demonetization drive in November 2016, it emerged as a key player in the propagation of digital payments. Initially, it was tasked with developing an action plan on advocacy, awareness and coordination. But as the 60-day period between November and December wore on, the Aayog donned several other hats.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That of a marketer, promoting the government‚Äôs UPI-based app, BHIM. It also turned to execution, responsible for holding Digi Dhan Melas across the country, along with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).\n\n**# Encroachment over other policy bodies**\n\n&gt;Quality Council of India, a quasi-governmental institution, reports directly to the PMO. The Aayog had originally been tasked with ranking states on different performance metrics like, ‚Äòease of doing business‚Äô, ‚Äòsmart city readiness‚Äô, ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô and others. The QCI is also doing similar work, ranking states as part of the Swachh Survekshan\xa02017, a survey commissioned by the ministry of urban development. Interestingly, the subgroup of chief ministers for the Swachh Bharat Mission reports to the NITI Aayog.\n\n**# It isn't clear who it is accountable to**\n\n&gt;It isn‚Äôt clear is who the NITI Aayog is accountable to, besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also its chairperson. Its mandates are also not as well-defined as the other government bodies, like say, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. ‚ÄúTomorrow, if the government doesn‚Äôt like a policy, or is facing a backlash from the people, it could simply blame it on the NITI Aayog. It becomes a ready-made scapegoat,‚Äù says a Bengaluru-based academic, who insisted on strict anonymity because of the nature of his work.\n\n**# Lack of representation**\n\n&gt;On 22-23 June, a protest was organised by the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), an RSS-affiliated trade union. Pawan Kumar, its organising secretary, says the protest was over the functioning of the Aayog, which the organisation believes is inherently flawed. The trigger for the protest, and the ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù, which the BMS claims to have conducted, was over a NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy‚Äôs statement in April, where he said that agricultural income beyond a certain threshold must be taxed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚Äú\\[The NITI Aayog\\] is like a super government. It is doing things it shouldn‚Äôt be doing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWho is it representing? There is no representation of employees, farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) And for a government that keeps harping about the progress of women, the NITI Aayog doesn‚Äôt even have a woman amongst its leadership.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kumar even alleged, and insisted on being quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe NITI Aayog as an institution could bring down the government if it was allowed to run amok as it currently is.‚Äù\n\n**# Slacking on key government initiatives**\n\n&gt;One of the senior bureaucrats *The Ken* spoke to, said that it was ‚Äúslacking‚Äù and ‚Äúnot proactive enough‚Äù in following up on key government initiatives like Smart Cities and Atal Innovation Mission (AIM). When the AIM was announced and the Aayog was made its nodal agency, there were several delays, in sanctioning funds and implementation, say sources. Perhaps for these reasons, say officials, that the Incredible India 2.0 planning has Kant, the architect of the previous campaign, missing from the action."<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'hnwuez'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hnwuez/the_niti_aayogs_midlife_identity_crisis/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Excessive villanization of governments and hospitals by media should stop if COVID cases increase'<br />Body: "This the story of my friend's dad in Hyderabad. Her dad had a pre-existing disease regarding heart problem already. He started developing symptoms a 9 days ago after he had to go to office for one day. He did not develop any respiratory problems then. His doctor never prescribed him a COVID test even after repeated requests. Four days ago symptoms have gone bad and they tried admitting him into a hospital. They roamed around Hyderabad for 8 hours searching for a bed and every hospital turned them down. They would say they have a bed but the moment they realize that he already has a preexisting condition the hospitals would refuse service. No one would do a test even. With no more options left, the family went to a government (osmania) hospital to get him admitted and get him tested. The hospital lacked basic hygiene apparently and also the doctors were trashed by some other patient's relatives last week. So doctors have been very cautious and scared apparently. On top of this the guard there told my friend's mom that there are thieves who come in night into the ward and steal stuff so my friends mom stays awake all night. In the morning luckily they convince them to do a test. The report was scheduled to come in 24-36 hours. The idea being if the report comes positive they can then admit him to Gandhi hospital which is taking COVID patients only. The report doesn't come until 72 hours. The doctors at osmania are scared to treat him and upon requests give him oxygen mask( not ventilator). His oxygen levels started dropping in last two days from 95 to 68 to 45. The report doesn't come and he could not get an ventilator bed in Gandhi because of the delay in report.\n\nThe report comes today morning and an hour later he is no more. The deceased body is not even given to the family now. Apparently they will only bury it ( my friend is a christian). Her grand parents are still alive and she is trying to get them tested but nope that is also not being done.\n\nSorry for the rant above. I think even though this kind of behavior by hospitals and doctors is reprehensible to say the least, there was pressure on them . The original doc was apparently told by ppl in Telangana government to not recommend tests until all the symptoms have been shown. Many posts in the other indian subreddit also confirm the same. The media starts blaming the governments of inaction whenever the cases increase and in turn I think governments are not interested in either reporting (like Mamata di ) or testing ( in Telangana) so that they can save themselves and show they are responding to the crisis well while they actually let patients die. I think we need to hold governments by actions and not results atleast in this pandemic case. Very unfortunate. Had the first doctor ordered a test, may be my friend's dad would have been alive or even if one of the number of private hospitals who declined admission actually had admitted him may it would have had different results. My friend works in USA and with new Trump rules she cannot go there to see her father as she cannot come back. This whole thing just sucks. I am sorry for the rant. Needed to vent.

Any and all interesting facts are welcome. We are not looking for something very academic. Something more substantive and insightful than just facts from a Wikipedia page. It could focus on small regions within states with a distinct culture and language.\n\nThe final write-up will be featured on our sidebar with due credits to users who contributed. At the end, we will have all states of India featured there\n\n**How will it work?**\n\nEvery 2 weeks, we will choose an Indian state or U.T and start a thread with a small write-up about the state and some basic facts. This will be a cultural exchange thread. Those interested to ask questions about the state or U.T can ask questions and people from there or who know about the region can answer these questions. In addition, those who want to make small write-ups or state some interesting facts about the state or U.T are also welcome to add their contributions to the thread.\n\nAt the end of the 2 weeks, we will collate the information from the thread and, with the help of users who contributed in the thread we will make a write-up including as much information as possible. It will be completely user-driven and those who wish to volunteer and contribute to the write-up on their states or U.Ts can directly contact the mods.\n\nIf you have any ideas on other things that can be incorporated in the thread or, ways to collate information or anything related to this, please reply to this post.\n\nHere are some examples of older weekly Geography threads -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/871jvg/weekly\\_geography\\_thread\\_1\\_andhra\\_pradesh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/871jvg/weekly_geography_thread_1_andhra_pradesh/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/87oy2x/weekly\\_geography\\_thread\\_2\\_arunachal\\_pradesh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/87oy2x/weekly_geography_thread_2_arunachal_pradesh/)\n\nWe also appreciate anybody who could volunteer to make infographics similar to the ones in the above links\n\nThank you'<br />Author: '1984_is_overrated_af'  id: 'hnq78j'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hnq78j/geography_history_people_food_culture_thread_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The 19th Century period of Indian Renaissance'<br />Body: 'The dawn of the nineteenth century witnessed the birth of a new vision‚Äîa modern vision among some enlightened sections of Indian society. This vision awakened the masses and inculcate modern values and logical thinking.\n\n**Social Conditions during the 19th century**\n\n**Religious and social ills**\n\n1. Indian society in the nineteenth century was caught under the religious superstitions and social stigma and magical charms.\n\n2. The priests were overly powered and their unhealthy influence on the minds of the people.\n\n3. Priests monopoly over religious scriptures and idolatry and polytheism blindly followed by the common person.\n\n**Depressing Position of Women**\n\n**1.** Attempts to kill female infants at birth were common practice in all over India.\n\n**2.** Child marriage was also very prevalent in Indian society.\n\n**3.** The practice of polygamy was very common in Bengal province under Kulinism.\n\n**4.** **Sa**ti practice was very prevalent during the 19th century,\n\n**5.** Widow remarriage was a taboo.\n\n**The Problem of Caste System**\n\n1. System of hierarchy and segregation on the basis of rituals status.\n\n2. Under the caste system, social mobility was checked.\n\n3. Social division across the caste,\n\n4. The practice of untouchability prevalent and it threatens national unity.\n\n**The opposition of western culture** \n\n**1.** The colonial culture was strictly opposed by common Indians.\n\nSocial reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ashwini Dutta, Swami Vivekananda, and more were influenced by modern values of English. They wanted to enlighten the masses from the democratic revolution, religious reforms movement, revivalist movement, and developing logical reasoning in masses.\n\n**Methods adopted by Social Reformers:** \n\n**1.** Develop and inculcate logical reasoning in masses \n\n**2.** Attempts to reconstruct traditional knowledge\n\n**3.** Use the vernacular language to spread the teaching like Roy used Bangla and Jyotibha Phule used Marathi and the same method followed by south Indian reformers.\n\n**4.** Creation of an alternative system of education.\n\n**5.** Promote ancient Indian tradition for the revival of religion like Dayanand Saraswathi said ‚ÄòGo back to Vedas‚Äô.\n\nIn the beginning, organizations such as the Social The conference, Servants of India Society and the Christian missionaries were instrumental in social reform along with many enlightened individuals like Jyotiba Phule, Gopalhari Deshmukh, K.T. Telang, B.M. Malabari, D.K. Karve, Sri Narayana Guru, E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker and B.R. Ambedkar. In later years, especially with the onset of the twentieth century, the national movement provided the leadership and organization for social reform.\n\nThe reformers basically appealed to the doctrines of individualism and equality, and argued, to bolster their appeal, that true religion did not sanction an inferior status to women.\n\nThey raised their voice against degrading customs such as polygamy, *purdah,* child marriage, restrictions on widow marriage, and worked relentlessly to establish educational facilities for women, to persuade the government to enact favorable legislation for women and in general to propagate the uselessness of medieval, feudal attitudes which required to be given up.\n\n**Steps were taken to Ameliorate Conditions** \n\n**Women‚Äôs Position.**\n\n**1.** Efforts of Raja Rammohan Roy and frontal attack against sati practice in Bengal and he convinced William Bentick to abolish the sati practice and Abolition of Sati Act (1829).\n\n2.  Preventing Female Infanticide, The practice of murdering female infants immediately after their birth was a common practice among the upper class who considered females to be an economic burden. The Bengal regulations of 1795 and 1804 declared infanticide illegal and equivalent to murder.\n\n3. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Brahmo samaj relentless efforts make widow remarriage reality and improve the women conditions and the Widow Remarriage Act (1856) was passed. Vishnu Shastri Pandit founded the Widow Remarriage Association in the 1850s. Another prominent worker in this field was Karsondas Mulji who started the *Satya Prakash* in Gujarati in 1852 to advocate widow remarriage. Similar efforts were made by Professor D.K. Karve in western India and by Veerasalingam Pantulu in Madras.\n\n4. The relentless efforts of a Parsi reformer, **B.M. Malabari**, were rewarded by the enactment of the **Age of Consent Act (1891)** which forbade the marriage of girls below the age of 12. The Sarda Act (1930) further pushed up the marriage age to 18 and 14 for boys and girls, respectively.\n\n5. Women‚Äôs Organisations In 1910, Sarla Devi Chaudhurani convened the first meeting of the Bharat Stree Mahamandal in Allahabad.\n\n**Struggle Against Caste-Based Exploitation**\n\n1. British rule, perhaps without intention, created certain conditions that undermined caste consciousness to an extent like the Education System of British India was secular, Administrative post open for all, etc.\n\n2. The social reform movements also strove to undermine caste-based exploitation like Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Prathana Samaj, etc.\n\n3. The national movement took inspiration from the principles of liberty and equality against the forces which tended to divide the society.\n\n4. With increasing opportunities for education and general awakening, there were stirrings among the lower castes themselves like Jyotibha Phule.\n\nThese movements and efforts of social reformers were awakening the masses.'<br />Author: 'Mr-MPSS'  id: 'hmwwbd'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hmwwbd/the_19th_century_period_of_indian_renaissance/</li>

It also provides comparison between Indian growth and growth of other east asian countries. The author explains how India grew in that period and why it grew in a way which was very different from the typical Asian growth model.\n\nThe later parts of the book focus on why India was forced to liberalize its economy in 1991, and the events that took place later on. Gives a detailed account of the policies taken during that period and the growth model adopted by India during the subsequent 15 years.\n\nLastly, it provides a calculated view of Indian economy of the future based on the path that the country has adopted post liberalization.\n\nOverall, it is a very interesting read and provides good insight on various aspects such as the culture, the economic policies, the judicial and education systems of India before Liberalisation and post independence.\n\nHowever, the book is published in 2008 so some of the things might seem outdated, but overall, it provides a very good account of the things. If anyone is interested to know how and why Indian economy is the way it is in the recent times, it is a very good read."<br />Author: 'eternalrocket'  id: 'hmt91t'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hmt91t/book_review_the_indian_renaissance_by_sanjeev/</li>

An important thing to note is that while the equipment deployment and even manufacturing would supposedly be Indian, the technology is acquired from USA based companies (**Altiostar**, where Tech Mahindra has significant investments and **Radisys**, which Reliance acquired in 2018). Indigenous telecom manufacturers have to fight tooth and nail to get the government to pay their dues^(\\[4\\]), forget about incentives.\n\nAnother strategic area of interest is semiconductor chip manufacturing. While China has aggressively stepped up advanced chip development^(\\[1\\]) and has a well-formulated policy^(\\[2\\]) of meeting their local demand indigenously, India doesn't seem to project any vision in that direction.

These apps are a threat to Indian integrity and Sovereignty.\n\n2. These apps are violating Sec 69A of the Information Technology Act (2000) which basically ensured the data rights of the Indians.\n\nMany Indians already data theft or personal data violation reported under the department of meity. This is the case of data sovereignty which is violating by Chinese apps.\n\nData protection of Individuals is not still under specific data protection act but it covers under IT Act.\n\nChinese External Affairs minister said that this is the violation of WTO rules and guidelines on Free Trade. Ji Rong, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in India, has already called this move ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù and says that it ‚Äúabuses national security exceptions‚Äù of the WTO rules.\n\nIs it a violation of WTO rules?\n\nthe first thing that needs to be settled is whether the regulatory framework to evaluate the app ban is the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). \n\nIt might be tempting to say that clothes being ordered on the app Shein, for example, involve the movement of a good and therefore implicate GATT whereas apps such as UC Browser constitute services under GATS.\n\nBut China already put a ban on YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and many other apps on the Ground of Internet governance as a sovereignty issue.\n\nUSA, European Union, and Australia already put a ban or restrict Chinese apps and other software.\n\nEuropean Union restricted some Chinese apps on the ground of national security and critical infrastructure like health, emergency services, etc.\n\nThe USA recently banned Huawei on the issue of data theft and Australia also used the national security clause on Chinese investments.\n\n**Consequences of Ban on Indian economy:**\n\nPeople who depended on the Chinese apps for their income sources are badly affected and Companies like bytedance in the near future plan for large investments which again a bad sign for the Indian economy for the short term. \n\nThese apps are a great source of entertainment and many people were dependent on these apps like TikTok has more than 600 million users. All these users affected for the short term.\n\n**Positive Aspects:** \n\nRecently India ‚Äì China Lac Standoff are continuing and our 20 Jawan‚Äôs martyred. India always takes a soft step to tackle the situation at the international stage. A border dispute between India ‚Äì China is continuing from the 1960s and still in the vague situation and border disputes can be solved by both consensuses.\n\nBut India as an emerging power is using both soft and hard steps to tackle any situation.\n\nBan on Chinese apps and new FDI rules are hard steps taken by India. These steps hurt India for the short-term but Now India can easily handle it.\n\nBesides these, This is an issue of Data sovereignty of every Indian, and data protection is duty of our government.'<br />Author: 'Mr-MPSS'  id: 'hmcw7o'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hmcw7o/ban_on_chinese_apps/</li>

But all it did was galvanize the public to side with the PM and be wary of China.\n2. **Take their chances** \\- There's no better time than now to do whatever geopolitical maneuvers in their best interest because all other countries are still reeling from the effects of the pandemic on their economy, while China's economy rebounded quickly.\n3. **Desperation** \\- Perhaps China is worried about a possible backlash against them after the world gets back to its feet.

      <li>Title::: 'Why are more and more Indians becoming so insecure about our traditions?'<br />Body: 'This video [science behind popular Indian traditions](https://youtu.be/RJK-X-qH2Yc) on YouTube  is shared by many insecure "educated" Indian and that video is full of BS. No there is no science behind most Indian traditions, but so what? We follow traditions because they are beautiful and make us feel good, one can say that applying tilak on forehead is unscientific because it doesn\'t benefit our bodies in any way and that\'s right but doing makeup is also unscientific as it doesn\'t benefit our bodies in any way.\n\nBut then why do people do those things? Because it makes them feel happy and that\'s good enough reason to do it. Going to temples is same as going to a music concert. But what more and more Indians are doing nowadays is coming up with pseudoscience to explain why we follow traditions, like if someone says "applying tilak on forehead is unscientific and you shouldn\'t do it" instead of saying "yes it\'s unscientific but it makes me feel happy so fuck you I\'ll do it anyway" we come up with pseudoscience to explain how applying tilak presses some nerves and shit, it\'s so insecure. \n\nThe video explains "science" behind some traditions like\n\nWhy do we visit temples?\n\nReal reason: It makes us happy when we visit temples.\n\nThe reason given in video: \n\n&gt;All temples are\rconstructed in zones by positive\rvibrations from the Earth\'s magnetic and\relectric fields can be tapped in\rabundance the peak of this energy is\rfelt at the garbha Griha or the sanctum\rsanctorum\rwhere the deity is installed\rpeople are asked to walk barefoot in\rtemples so that the radiation is easily\rabsorbed men are advice to visit temples\rbare chested as the human hair has the\rcapacity to absorb positive energy women\rare asked to wear gold ornaments when\rthey visit the temples as gold is one of\rthe best absorbers and radiators of positive energy\n\nWhat a load of BS, what the heck is "positive vibrations", pro tip: you hear something like "it emits positive energy" it\'s a scam.\n\nWhy do womens unable to have children visit genesha under the peppal tree?\n\nReal reason: It gives them hope\n\nThe reason given in video:\n\n&gt;the Ganesha sitting beneath the people\rtree or the RS amara vinegar is a widely\rpopular deity of worship among women\rthere is a common belief that women who\rare unable to conceive will be able to\rdo so if they visit this vinegar every\rday in the early hours of the morning\rwith wet clothes after a shower and walk in circles around the tree the secret\rbehind the miraculous success of this\rpractice is the people tree this tree is\rknown to give out high amounts of oxygen\rand very minimal amounts of carbon\rdioxide through the day\roxygen is said to be the best cure for hormonal imbalances in the body and\rnaturally brings undernourished organs\rback to normalcy gradually the hormones\rin the uterus start functioning\rroutinely and the woman is able to\rconceive wet clothes help in better\rabsorption of oxygen thus ensuring\rmaximum benefit of the ritual the motive\n\nNo peppal tree doesn\'t give more oxygen and less carbon dioxide than normal trees, harmonal inbalance is only one of many reaseons which cause infertility, we have more than enough oxygen in air to satisfy our needs any more oxygen concentration won\'t have any benefit at all, we\'ll get same amount of oxygen underneath a tree and out in open because trees produce oxygen slowly and arcoss a wide area not a single point so oxygen concentration beneath a tree is no different than in house. We aren\'t frogs, we can\'t absord oxygen through skin.\r\n\nComing up with pseudoscience like this makes us look like a clown.

      <li>Title::: "If Nehru were alive he wouldn't let Rahul or Priyanka become PM of India just because they are born from foreigner mother. Here is why."<br />Body: "Here is a glaring historical example of Nehru's thoughts regarding similar case. Yashwant Rao Holkar II became ruler of Indore in 1926 after his father, Tukoji III's scandal (bawla murder case) &amp; subsequent abdication. \n\nYashwant Rao's 1st wife died early and he married an American divorcee, later he married another American lady. In 1961 when Yashwant Rao died, he was only titular head of Indore. After his death, his eldest son Richard Holkar (full title: Maharajkumar Shrimant Richard Shivajirao Yeshwant Rao Holkar Bahadur) born from his American wife was to become titular head. But Jawahar Lal Nehru intervened and refuse to acknowledge son of foreigner lady as head of Indore. Usha Devi Holkar, daughter of Yashwant Rao from his first marriage, a woman, was made the titular head of Indore just bcz his brother was half American. \n\nAlthough at that time there was no real power in the hand of ertswhile rulers, the title was still recognised by Indian Govt and they were paid privy purse. So even a titular ruler without any real power wasnt accepted by Nehru  because he was born of foreigner lady.\n\nThen what would have Nehru thought for someone who is born of foreigner woman and try to wield a real power like PM of India.\n\nHere are some sources: \n\n[A short synopsis in the week News article](https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/bygone-grandeur.html)\n\n[A book source which talks about Indore royal family of modern period in detail](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EeUvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Troubles+in+indore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQ1bi0q7PqAhUL63MBHQ1sBEgQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Troubles%20in%20indore&amp;f=false)"<br />Author: 'sajaypal007'  id: 'hl1vnv'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hl1vnv/if_nehru_were_alive_he_wouldnt_let_rahul_or/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How the British destroyed the Indian weaving industry'<br />Body: 'How the British impoverished weavers and destroyed a thriving free market economy in India\n\nThe cotton industry pre British was a multifold industry. The flow was, Foreign buyers (Arabs, Europeans, Chinese etc) were based in ports and contracted banias to supply Cotton textiles. Banias would assign this subcontract to their agents who would finally subcontract it to the weavers.\n\nThe producers (weavers) dictated pricing, sourced their own raw materials and were free to supply to multiple agents of various banias. \nIn a classical Marxist sense the labour controlled the tools of labour and income was generated on the basis of to each to his her own. This was also strangely textbook free-market economics at play. However it all changed with the arrival of the Europeans.\n\nThese "free market" loving progeny of Adam Smith though didn\'t like the total lack of control on pricing this process had and took to establishing a top down control with an iron hand. First they started bypassing the Banias and started seeding their own agents in the hinterland but after they took control of territory by conquest it changed entirely.\n\nThey took physical charge. According to Historian Sinnappah Arasaratnam (Weavers, Merchants &amp;, Company) weavers lost the ability to produce for any customer they chose, part payment was in cotton yarn (whose price and quality they could not fix) and eventually strict supervision by agents of the British.\n\nThe next level of control was assigning by the Comp, EIC approved banias,\xa0EIC eventually appointed comp approved overseers who controlled all aspects of the weavers life, produce and commerical value. It legally bound weavers to contracts that tied them only to EIC banias and started with fines but soon after took to physical punishment\n\n(Hossain - Alienation of weavers and Mitra - the cotton weavers of Bengal)\n\nCommon punishment if a weaver dared work independently or for other merchants was flogging (sometimes of minor children to send a message), blacking of face with coal and being paraded on a donkey. The impact was devastating!\n\nPre Europeans, 1/3rd of the revenue from the sale of textiles went to the producer (weaver) but by the early 18th century, this was down to 6%. Precipitous 80% fall in income.\n\nAs income declined, so did living standards and mortality rates of weavers saw a massive uptick. (Om Prakash - Textile manufacturing with and without consent, an LSE paper avbl online).\n\nBy the mid 18th century the EIC was paying the weavers 70% in Yarn and 30% cash, when weavers protested that they could not even make a living, they were predictably flogged, jailed and dispersed. Things came to a head in TN and in 1778, 1,000+ weavers in 2 villages stopped work, and finally forced the EIC to relent a bit. Yet these weavers also said that from 1769-1778 their incomes had fallen 30%.\xa0\n\nBy 1790 EIC was not even covering costs of production (Arasaratnam), one trade body complained that to produce 12 yards of cloth the cost was Rs 8, but the now monopoly driven EIC paid only Rs 7.5\n\nThis was in the South where things were "better", in Bengal it was orders of magnitude worse as the EIC worked on the Gumastha system. Basically the region was divided into 19 residencies, subdivided into "aurangs" and a EIC salaried employee, the Indian Gumastha ran the business of cotton production on behalf of the white masters\n\nLike in South India conditions were so poor that Bengali weavers sent a petition to the head of the trade mission in Calcutta (one John Bathoe), he...agreed to the terms and then promptly reneged because he never had an intention to keep up his word.\n\nThen the British not content with driving weavers into beggary came up with a new method to extract money, they classified finished goods in order of quality. There were 5 levels of quality with the lowest being called "flirty". The problem was that this was entirely subjective. So what the EIC deemed 3rd grade and paid lower prices was deemed 1st grade by the Dutch and French. Even the "worst quality" that the British didn\'t pay for had a large market.\n\nThe EIC retained the rejected pieces &amp; then sold them on the side at a full profit\n\nso as an example, in 1767, the same Bathoe rejected 900 pieces as "flirty". He then used his gumasthas to sell these "rejected" pieces at 7-8 INR / piece of which he retained Rs 3/piece. Rs 2,700 in 1767 was an absolute fortune.\n\nBy the 1815\'s and on, weavers were a destitute, bankrupt lot who died in famines by the millions. A mere 100 years ago they were a prosperous group. Their downfall was not caused by the Indian bania but the insidious British and their blind robbery of India.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'hl00de'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hl00de/how_the_british_destroyed_the_indian_weaving/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Glitch in the matrix.'<br />Body: '\n\nIt has happened many times. \n\nAnd perhaps to many of you as well. \n\n"You look just like someone I know" \n\nSome times its their friend or a cousin or even a nephew. But the question is has it escalated beyond this?\n\nA complete stranger giving you a high five? Someone you have never seen in your life talking to you like they have known you for years? \n\nThe first time it happened to me, that I can remember of, was when I was around fourteen years old. I was at a bicycle shop when this guy greeted me warmly. Couple of years older, he talked to me like he held me in high regard. I was thoroughly confused, an older guy was talking to me with such respect and familiarity. He recalled the last time he had met me. I had never seen him in my life. \n\nThis happened again, in exactly same fashion, when I was in college. I was at a restaurant a complete stranger came to me and started talking to me like he had known me for years. When I admitted, "sorry I dont recognize you", the guy simply turned away and left like a robot, no explanation of how he confused me with someone he knew or even a sheepish apology. I wonder if he had attended a seminar where they told him to approach 50 people that day.\n\nSurprisingly whenever this happened I was always alone. Having no alibi it was hard to convince someone that this happens to me often. \n\nI was visiting a cousin in a city I had never been to. So I was out with him doing some purchasing, discussing how this happens to me and he was giving me the all too familiar sceptical face.\n\nWe were discussing this as we entered a shop, the shopkeeper with an amused face said, didnt you just leave the shop?'<br />Author: 'Illustrious__enticer'  id: 'hkm3y4'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hkm3y4/glitch_in_the_matrix/</li>
      <li>Title::: "[Series] India's China Policies - The two roads that weren't"<br />Body: "*I will write some series of how the  previous governments have dealt with China, to start of with I will write something that happened not so long ago during the UPA regime. Check source for link to the last series*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2007-2008 BRO decided to construct 2 roads 1 summer to Daulat Beg Oldi, 1 winter and 1 summer road. Reason for 2, during winter lake freezes. summer snow melts, cant cross via motor. \n\nSomething about BRO, The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) develops and maintains road networks in India's border areas and friendly neighboring countries. Officers from the Border Roads Engineering Service (BRES) and personnel from the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) form the parent cadre of the Border Roads Organisation. One is a civilian component and one from military. Both are always at loggerheads and never agree to each others decisions.\n\nThey dont even attend each other's events, even events like dinner , anniversary and celebrations of a difficult project.\n\nAnyways with a lot of difficulty the project started. Then came on Ghasi Ram around 2010,He went on inspection of the roads\n\nThese were built by Task force of the  General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) by Military Ghasi was from Civilian unit. He started finding faults. This is wrong that is wrong, so the work was stopped. Enquiry was commissioned to look into the matters.\n\nWork was stopped until 2013.\n\nMeanwhile Ghasi was moved to Rajasthan, he was later removed due to imcompetence, now he lives in Tripura not sure what he is doing there.\n\nAnd the road work resumed the final date was moved from 2012 to 2016/2017 for road finishing. But ground workers said it wont happen even before 2022\n\nNow this is the same road or one of those roads that is still under construction. It is these roads that the Chinese are protesting against\n\nRemember the project started in 2007, meanwhile Chinese build all infra on their side by now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nSham Saran was asked to tour Ladakh and Siachen area and identify places where roads and infra is needed in 2005. He was a good trekker. He was ex Foreign Secretary , he was appointed Prime Minister‚Äôs Special Envoy and also in National Security Advisory Board under .\n\nHe identified 75 roads that could be build to help out our troops and for other strategical purposes.\n\nSaran had reported that the Chinese have built a motorable kutcha road to a sensitive Track Junction area in the DBO sector, thus changing the position on ground and in violation of the 2005 protocol.\n\nSaran is also concerned with the situation in Chumar where the PLA is making frequent transgressions, claiming 85 sq km of Indian territory despite the international border defining the two countries.\n\nIn 2013 , after the Daulat Beg incident, Public was angry and there was a lot pressure on govt. So they setup a committee to check on the Saran report\n\nThe committe could never get their hands on the report. Can you believe this ? How could a report not be found!\n\nThe April 15, 2013, Depsang incursion at Raki Nullah was designed to prevent the Indian patrols from reaching Points 10, 11, 11A and 13 with Point 12 outside the patrol line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tardy pace of road work along China border raod**\n\nIn brazen slackness on the part of the Indian establishment vis-√†-vis China, work on the strategically vital roads in the Himalayas is tottering way behind schedule and in some cases, has totally stopped. As a result, only 25 per cent of the road-building work that was allocated for this financial year has been completed so far, even as half the fiscal is over.\n\nWith winter having set in as far as the Himalayas are concerned, progress on the road-building will be even slower than in the first half of the fiscal that ended on September 30. So far, only Rs 1337 crore have been spent by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) out of its budget of Rs 4962 crore for the year 2011-12.\n\nSources said at this rate, work will suffer badly. They also estimate that the lag this year will be worse than last year, when the BRO could not utilise its Rs 5427 crore budget and returned Rs 946 crore that was meant for building strategic roads.\n\nA reported clash of egos and divergence of priorities between two groups of officials within the BRO, who have put their ‚Äòfalse prestige‚Äô ahead of national interest, is one of the prime reasons for the scenario, sources across the BRO and the Ministry of Defence said.\n\nSome of the roads are of such strategic importance that the Army is paying out of its own budget and some roads had been recommended by the all-powerful China Study Group (CSG) headed by the Cabinet Secretary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chinese Aggression**\n\nChina has a set of fuzzy claims all along its boundary with India, and the American scholar M Taylor Fravel has found that China historically has escalated militarily when it perceives steps taken by others erode the likelihood of China ever securing its territorial claims. In this case, Indian road- and bridge-building in the area, especially combined with Ladakh‚Äôs change to union territory status, may have led China to conclude a sharp signal might be necessary to arrest developments weakening its hold on disputed areas in eastern Ladakh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is India Starting to Flex Its Military Muscles? - Doklam Incdient**\n\nA new willingness to use force beyond its borders suggests that a sleeping giant may be awakening.\n\nIndia deployed troops to prevent China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) from constructing a road on the Doklam plateau near the contested Bhutan-China-India border. Indian forces stood in the path of the construction crews, blocking their work and at times even tussling with Chinese troops. Despite increasingly harsh warnings from Beijing, including the threat of ‚Äúall-out confrontation,‚Äù the Indians held fast. After a nearly two-month standoff, both sides disengaged and the PLA stopped its road-building activity, though China made clear that it would ‚Äúcontinue fulfilling its sovereign rights‚Äù by stationing troops and patrolling in the area.\n\nIt is tempting to dismiss Doklam as yet another inconsequential Sino-Indian spat in a long-disputed border region. But that would be a mistake. The standoff suggests that changes may be afoot in India ‚Äî changes that could significantly alter India‚Äôs strategic character.\n\nIndia, in its 70-year history, has rarely sought to employ force beyond its borders. When it has done so, it has generally faced relatively weak adversaries, such as the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka during the late 1980s, and potential coup-makers in the Maldives in 1988. In the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, India confronted an able adversary, and it attacked well into enemy territory, nearly reaching the border city of Lahore. But India did not seek this conflict, which began when Pakistan attempted to seize Kashmir with irregular and conventional forces. India‚Äôs most ambitious military operation occurred in 1971, when it launched a large-scale armored thrust into East Pakistan, severing Pakistan‚Äôs Eastern and Western wings and helping to create the new state of Bangladesh. India acted only after an influx into West Bengal of refugees fleeing Pakistan‚Äôs civil war had forced its hand, however. Unable to absorb the flow of new arrivals, it had little choice but to attack East Pakistan and put an end to the crisis. So is China afraid of losing Aksai Chin ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[*https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/17/is-india-starting-to-flex-its-military-muscles/*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/17/is-india-starting-to-flex-its-military-muscles/)\n\n[*https://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20111018/main5.htm*](https://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20111018/main5.htm)\n\n[*www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-china-trying-to-achieve-5-experts-weigh-in/story-Jai6IGvvk7l3HrOSeVeN6O.html*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-china-trying-to-achieve-5-experts-weigh-in/story-Jai6IGvvk7l3HrOSeVeN6O.html)\n\n[*https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/china-army-not-letting-indian-troops-patrol-lac/story-S6yWrX4AR28uH7KUFluVnM.html*](https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/china-army-not-letting-indian-troops-patrol-lac/story-S6yWrX4AR28uH7KUFluVnM.html)\n\n[*\\[Series\\] India's China Policies - UPA Govt's reaction to 2 events - 2008 Beijing Olympics - Tibetan Protests and Incursion of China in the strategic Daulat Beig Oldie ( April 2013)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc2ncj/series_indias_china_policies_upa_govts_reaction/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Inspiration:***\n\n*Self-Deception: India's China Policies - Arun Shourie*"<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'hklgf4'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hklgf4/series_indias_china_policies_the_two_roads_that/</li>
