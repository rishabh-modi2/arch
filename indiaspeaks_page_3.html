In this thread, I am happy to to share the fifth in a series on the history of the Arabian Peninsula. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Gota declares new emergency in Sri Lanka](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/asia/sri-lanka-president-rajapaksa-state-of-emergency-hnk-intl/index.html)\n\nSri Lanka\'s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced a new emergency in the island country, allowing him to use the army to break up protests and a general strike that has crippled his administration. Protesters are demanding the resignation of him and his entire family, while opposition political parties are calling for radical constitutional amendments that would abolish the executive presidency and restore substantial powers to Parliament. Finance Minister Ali Sabry meanwhile admitted that the country\'s forex reserves are almost zero despite massive aid from India, meaning no relief is expected soon. Negotiations with the IMF continue.\n\n2. [Lula launches bid for presidency in Brazil](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/7/lula-launches-official-campaign-for-brazil-presidency)\n\nBrazil’s former President and leftist icon Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ("Lula") launched an official bid to unseat incumbent right wing President Jair Bolsanaro in the country\'s presidential election scheduled for October. Lula, who used an oil price boom to lift 30 million Brazilians out of poverty in the 2000s, has been in the wilderness since being jailed for corruption charges in 2012. The country\'s Supreme Court eventually overturned the conviction years later, calling the original case judge biased (that judge eventually became Bolsanaro\'s justice minister), and clearing the way for Lula\'s return. Although he has a cult following with the country\'s mostly young leftists, the margin between the two candidates is actually quite narrow according to opinion polls. \n\n3. [Taliban orders all women to cover up head to toe](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/07/1097382550/taliban-women-burqa-decree)\n\nThe Taliban regime in Afghanistan, further showing that it is no different from its previous avatar, ordered all women and girls in the country to wear a full-body burqa, with nothing but their eyes showing. This comes in the wake of the regime effectively banning all female education above class 6.  "We want our sisters to live with dignity and safety," said Khalid Hanafi, acting minister for the Taliban\'s vice and virtue ministry. This move further shows US President Joe Biden\'s failed idea of using economic carrots and sticks to coerce the Taliban to respect women\'s rights after they defeated NATO forces.\n\n4. [China makes former cop new leader of Hong Kong](https://apnews.com/article/china-elections-asia-beijing-hong-kong-fb874ec5055f776715cc68d88a86d933)\n\nIn the final deathblow to democracy in Hong Kong, the Special Autonomous Region\'s legislature is all set to elect  John Lee, a former police chief, as the chief executive. He is the *only* candidate that was cleared by Beijing, and therefore the election is more of a show for propaganda value than an genuine competition. According to Beijing\'s National Security Law, only "patriotic" candidates with pre-clearance from Beijing are eligible to hold any office in the city. Lee is currently under US sanctions for his role in crushing protests against the law.\n\n5. [Putin apologizes to Israel for Lavrov\'s bizarre comments](https://news.yahoo.com/putin-apologizes-to-israel-for-bizarre-nazi-comments-170121084.html)\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made a bizarre comment in a TV interview. When asked how Ukraine could support Nazis when Ukrainian President Zalensky himself was Jewish, Lavrov joked that even Hitler had some Jewish blood. This is a common, anti-Semitic trope used in many Slavic countries to deny or downplay the Holocaust, and is not true. His comments however, led to a huge protest from Israel. Lavrov\'s Ministry followed it up with a statement accusing Israel of supporting Nazis in Ukraine (!), even though Israel has remained neutral and refused to implement Western sanctions despite intense pressure. The matter was finally ended in a direct call between Putin and Israeli PM Bennett, where the former apologized and the apology was accepted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Children of Sykes-Picot Part 5: The Small but Big Gulf States\n\n *This is the fifth part of a series discussing the history of the countries in the Middle East that were born of the Sykes-Picot pact.*\n\n[Part 1: Background](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sg001q/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_nato/)\n\n[Part 2: The Arab Revolt](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srsrha/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_canada/)\n\n[Part 3: The Partition](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/tpn239/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_sri/) \n\n[Part 4: Saudi Arabia](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/u03fth/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_new/)\n\nUp until now, this series has focused on the happenings on the western side of the Arab peninsula, around the Red and Mediterranean Seas. These are the areas that are the most densely populated and were part of the Ottoman Empire. But it\'s not as if the eastern coast, along the Persian Gulf, was empty either. Those areas, though far from the influence of the Ottomans, had a crucial geopolitical location since they sat right next to two great Asian civilizations: Persia and India. These two traded with Europe for millennia (indeed, their English names are Latinized versions of geographical features - the Pars plateau and the Indus river, respectively), but Persia usually traded by land and India by sea. \n\nSea trade is a funny affair. We like to think of it as just ships going about their business, but they\'re manned by real people in what is basically a **lawless** environment. On the east were the extraordinarily rich civilizations of Persia and India, to the west were the industrializing nations of Europe. In the middle were poor, nomadic tribes that lived near oases in the desert. Naturally, there was piracy. The Portuguese, operating out of Goa and the Bombay islands, were the first to attempt to fight it, by building forts and sending patrols to the area. But once the British East India Company won a presence in India, the Royal Navy got involved. In 1809 and then again in 1819, they invaded the small oases near the coast, forcing them to sign an **Agreement of Truce**. These seven little kingdoms - Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah - were collectively called the **Trucial States**. Separately, the British signed a similar agreement with the island kingdom of Bahrain. These kingdoms agreed to become British protectorates, ceding their foreign relations, currency, and communications to Britain, in exchange for guaranteed military protection, primarily from Persia. The Trucial States were administered by the Governor-General of British India from Bombay, which by then had gone from the Portuguese to the British as dowry.\n\nThe Trucial States and Bahrain, in general, remained impoverished desert outposts for much of the 19th century. A major export for them was natural pearls, with a major patron being the Nizam of Hyderabad, another protectorate of British India. They had their own kings and legal codes, but there wasn\'t much to enforce. It was boring, especially compared to the hectic activities going on in the western side of the Arabian peninsula. Being British protectorates, they survived Ibn Saud\'s conquest of the Arabian peninsula that saw the Hashemites driven out of Mecca - even the religious fanatic was not foolish enough to challenge the Royal Navy. \n\nFrom the 1930s onward, as oil began to be discovered in the region, the British secured exclusive exploration rights for their own companies and sure enough, they eventually found it - huge reserves of oil (and later natural gas) in the waters off Abu Dhabi. However, this was in the 1950s. In between, Britain has been severely weakened by WW2, and India had gained independence. The net result was that the British could not afford to keep protecting the Trucial States and Bahrain, although some responsibilities like currency were adopted by the new Government of India. By 1971, things had reached a head - the Indian government had stopped supporting the currency of the Trucial States, and Britain itself fell into economic decline. The decision was made - Britain would leave the Gulf by December, 1971 over the objections and pleas of the kingdoms. Those states had no functioning army or navy, and their oil and territory was coveted by Persia (now called Iran) and Saudi Arabia. The kingdoms had a year to figure out their affairs. \n\nIn mid-1971, Iran attacked and annexed two oil-rich islands in the Gulf even as a British destroyer watched on. This incident forced the kingdoms to stop bickering with each other: days before the Agreement of Truce was to terminate, six of them (later joined by Ras Al Khaimah) joined to form a new country, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Bahrain declined to join and declared independence instead. **Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nayhan**, the emir of Abu Dhabi, became the first president. After the spook of the Iranian annexation of its islands, the country formed alliances with the west and built a strong military. While Abu Dhabi still had all the oil, each emirate was free to have its own economic policy. Most of them decided to stay around the traditional occupations of pearls and fishing, but Dubai chose a radically different route - opening up to global trade and capital and investing heavily in infrastructure, including the massive Port of Jebel Ali. In this mass hysteria of construction, Dubai rekindled the emirates\' old relationship with India - millions of workers from the subcontinent gave their sweat and blood to build those projects. \n\nToday, the UAE is the most diversified economy in the entire Gulf, with the largest number of expatriates who face an extremely friendly business environment, particularly in Dubai. Bahrain, meanwhile, has tried to emulate Dubai\'s strategy but with limited success, being better known as a holiday destination for not-very-conservative Saudi elites and home of the US Navy\'s Sixth Fleet. And to think, it all began with some pirates. In Part 6, we\'ll go further south and look at two countries that could not be more different: Yemen and Oman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have any interesting stories from around the world?

      <li>Title::: 'The Purpose of Distributing Freebies and Striking A Balance'<br />Body: " Many of us use the word freebies because we hear the word “free” often. In this post, I will be discussing.\n\n**What are freebies?**\n\nWell, in economic terms, we often put together the term freebies and subsidises. Subsidies too come along with freebies.\n\nFreebies are the things that are promised in the elections. Most famous items are “FREE ELECTRICITY” &amp; “FREE WATER”. \n\nWell, the thing is I tried to search Google to find out which country provides its citizens with free electricity. I found one but it isn’t close to what is happening in India. That is Germany. ([https://www.buzzworthy.com/germany-free-electricity-excess/](https://www.buzzworthy.com/germany-free-electricity-excess/))\n\nElectricity is something that can be misued by many people. Let’s just say that if we don’t charge consumers, they can get careless. Now, in Delhi, if you use electricity beyond a certain limit, you would need to pay. But hold on a second, I found another article. \n\n([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/power-dept-asks-for-rs-3200cr-subsidy-for-zero-bill-scheme/articleshow/90278106.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/power-dept-asks-for-rs-3200cr-subsidy-for-zero-bill-scheme/articleshow/90278106.cms))\n\nPower Department of Delhi asked for Rs 3,200 crores subsisdy. Out of 54.5 lakh , 15.5 lakh consume 201-400 units every month. 27.7 lakhs pay Rs 0 for consumption upto 200 units. I mean, this is a bit ridiculous.\n\nYou ask for Rs 3,200 subsidy which can allow you to invest in better infrastructure, better law and order but no.\n\n**So what is the purpose of giving the freebies?**\n\nWell, you need to understand that every government has to ensure that its citizens are employed (of course full employment is impossible and impractical) and ensure that there is a sustainable growth for economy and sustainable inflation.\n\nElectricity is not something that should be given for free. Many state governments try to uplift the citizens life by providing with freebies and subsidies. However, there is a need to strike a balance between whom you need to uplift and whom do you need not uplift.\n\nSenior Minister of Singapore, Tharman SHANMUGARATNAM once said this :\n\n“Almost every country today faces an acute challenge of preserving a fair social compact. In the advanced world, it is made more difficult by prolonged sub-normal growth and the need for fiscal consolidation. Tough choices have to be made – choices over how the sacrifices needed today should be borne and by whom, in order that society emerges better tomorrow.”\n\n“The emerging economies too face an increasing challenge of achieving inclusive growth - with China on the one hand facing the prospect of an ageing population that is still largely poor, and India and most other developing countries on the other having to create more and better jobs for a rapidly growing young workforce.”\n\n“The basic concerns however are common. Almost everywhere, people’s hopes and the key tasks of government  are focused on three  issues:\n\nFirst,  enabling people to have jobs and better incomes over time;\n\nSecond, preserving a sense of social equity, and especially giving people with humble beginnings the opportunities to see their lives improve and move up;\n\nThird, ensuring a fair deal between generations. In the advanced countries especially, there is the growing challenge of providing a fair deal for today’s generation of young people.  “\n\nIn the case of the freebies, the second one would be more relevant. We do wish to see poverty being removed. But in that case, why do we still need to give freebies.\n\n**Example 1: AAP ruled states**\n\nLet’s look at AAP ruled states:\n\nUnemployment is :\n\nDelhi at 11.2 and Punjab is at 7.2%. \n\nQuestion is should we give more freebies to uplift these people? Or to bring new investments to provide employment to these people?\n\nLiteracy Rate for the Delhi and Punjab are at 88.7% and 83.7%. How is it possible that the unemployment is high?\n\nI think the state governments for both need to find out how to strike a balance between freebies, unemployment and generating jobs.\n\nDelhi is a union territory which means it can provide services and provide a place for businesses to have their businesses to have their India address registered in Delhi. The state government should come up with an idea to generate jobs through these means. An idea would be to make Delhi one of the places to have MICE events.\n\nPunjab has abundant resources and has potential for tourism. The Punjab Government should consider diversifying their sources to generate jobs for the people to ensure that they have enough incomes.\n\n**Example 2: Singapore Example**\n\nMany are aware of how Singapore runs a successful economy. Being separated from Malaysia in 1965, the city state has come a long way to become a bustling city state with myriad of activities. Singapore has a unique problem. The problem is that they did not have natural resources. The defence sector was booming until the British left the defence to the Singapore Government. Defence contributed heavily to the Singapore GDP. The former late Lee Kuan Yew decided to make a metropolis which will be bustling. Fast forward, Singapore, despite not having any natural resources decided to be one of the financial hubs in the world and for Asia, after Mumbai and Hong Kong , aviation hub and also shipping hubs. \n\nMany corporations also come to Singapore to set up headquarters for the city state so that they can function out from Singapore. This is no thanks to the tax structure the Singapore Government has. Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong decided to convert the Marina Bay area which was a reclaimed land from 1970s into what is known for the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens By The Bay. He knew that Singapore had to diversify its sources of income and jobs generation. Now MBS holds [MICE](https://www.cvent.com/uk/blog/hospitality/what-is-mice) events every year. \n\n([Corporate Income Tax](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax) )\n\n[Marina Bay Before and After \\(https:\\/\\/www.marinabaysands.com\\/museum\\/exhibition-archive\\/singapore-stories\\/about-exhibition.html\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ndnmj6yo9zx81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1045c0bea170168ed7df6213c84b628d160df9a5)\n\nBesides, Singapore Government has an interesting concept of providing freebies. Singapore gives freebies based on the household’s income and whether they are lower, lower-middle or middle income households. This concept is a unique concept and is also applied for India. However, in India context, we do it on the basis of ST/SC , OBC and etc.\n\nSome useful websites :\n\n[Singapore's Healthcare System](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/resources-statistics/educational-resources/3m_updated_engwebver77d4b49ef2a145d7b242894738b8c835.pdf) , [CHAS](https://www.chas.sg/content.aspx?id=306)\n\nMoreover, healthcare is not free and Singaporeans pay 50% and the Government takes 50%. This is the total opposite of how things are in India. There are some places which offer free healthcare. But if we were to pay from our pockets and if that is used to enhance the infrastructure, that would be great. But the systemic corruption will ruin it. Therefore, the mentality must change where government employees should be given reasonable renumeration to motivate them to do their job.\n\nSo if you are wondering what has this to do with freebies? We must not allow everything to be free. The governments who are elected should have thought through carefully, do some careful financial analysis and decide on what should be given for free if they wish or provide things at small fee like ration or what should not be free.\n\nPublic goods like education and transport should not be free if they wish to have their state folks to benefit from good maintenance.

      <li>Title::: 'Just want to vent about the tragic condition of stray dogs in our country.'<br />Body: "[Posting here because my post keeps getting banned for some reason on the other sub]\n\nI'm making this post mainly because I'm extremely sad and I want to talk about some really tragic events I witnessed in the last few days.\n\nAbout five months ago, a random stray puppy came inside our house's compound and was sleeping under the stairs. I thought she might die if left alone and decided to raise her. [Here's a pic](https://imgur.com/a/Yknt6u4) I took on the first day and here's a more [recent pic](https://imgur.com/kxbGAbw). She's very happy and healthy now and this post isn't about her. A few days after I started raising her, I learnt from some neighbors that she was born to a stray dog which used to live in the street behind my house and that she was the only puppy from the litter who had survived and that all the other puppies had died.\n\nAround March 4th, that same stray dog gave birth to another litter of seven puppies. She had them in an open ground in front of an apartment which is used as a parking area. It was very dangerous there because it gets very dark at night and there are cars constantly coming and going and people walking around who could've accidentally crushed the puppies. There are also some kids (less than 10 years old probably) who were borderline torturing the puppies. They were picking them up and dropping them on the ground really hard and they were also separating them from their mother and making them unable to drink milk when she came to feed them by taking them inside their homes to play and then bringing them back an hour or so later. The puppies were literally just 3-4 days old and extremely fragile and not even able to open their eyes yet. I told the kids to leave them alone but they didn't care and neither did their parents who are apparently okay with their children torturing puppies.\n\nSo I put them all in a box and relocated them to a different spot in front of my house which was very safe. It's an empty isolated spot behind a shed and nobody every goes there. [Here's a pic of them in the box](https://imgur.com/a/91Xh2i2). Their mother also followed me and started living in the new spot. I and a few neighbors were feeding the mother and the puppies were growing up fine and healthy. [Here's a video of them playing](https://vimeo.com/707208554) and [an adorable pic of them sleeping](https://imgur.com/a/dpDbMZs).\n\nThen suddenly on April 15th one of them died (one of the black puppies). I don't know how it happened. It was fine the previous day and it was laying dead the next morning. Then in the last three days, two more puppies died. One of them (the brown puppy with the bent tail) was sleeping under a parked car and died when the car was moved and another puppy (the grey one) got ran over by a car on the road. It was very graphic. I was watching them run, play and grow up every day and it was absolutely horrible to see them like that. I feel totally devastated and frustrated that I couldn't do anything. I couldn't take them inside my house and raise them there because my mother and other tenants wouldn't allow it and I was already raising a dog. There are no animal shelters or anything like that in my town. Maybe I should've posted on social media and asked if somebody wanted to adopt but I don't use social media at all and that idea didn't even come to my mind.\n\nI've decided to get the mother dog spayed because I don't want to see any more puppies dying gruesome deaths. It's the government's responsibility to control the population of stray animals by spaying or neutering them but I have to do their job because they don't bother to fucking do it despite collecting plenty of municipal tax. I read that they do have birth control programs in some places but they're rarely executed correctly. In some places they just catch the dogs, cut their ears as a mark pretending that they've been neutered and then just let them go because they're too fucking lazy to actually do the surgery and in some places they do such a half-assed job that the stitches open up and the dogs are left bleeding on the streets. In most places, they just let their population get out of control. Then they just catch them with ropes, round them all up in a truck and kill them cruelly by beating them to death with sticks. \n\nAlmost none of the government servants give a single fuck about doing their job properly. The only thing most of them care about is whether they're getting paid at the end of the month or not. They don't care at all about whether they've actually earned that paycheck. Government jobs have become a convenient way to sit on your ass and collect paychecks and bribes with no risk of getting fired for being lazy or incompetent.\n\nAnyway, a total of 7 puppies were born and within two months, 3 are dead, 2 got adopted by locals and 2 are still living on the street. They're both female and after they grow up, I'm going to get the spayed too. If anybody's interested in adopting them, please let me know. I live in a town in Andhra Pradesh and can DM more details if you want to know.\n\nAlso, to those who are reading this, I know it's not an easy and simple thing to do but if you are able to, please get the stray dogs in your local area spayed. One female stray dog can give birth to dozens of puppies in her life time and at least half of those puppies will die and even the one who survive struggle a lot due to lack of proper food, shelter and medical aid. They should be spared of this misery."<br />Author: 'PixelPotat'  id: 'uk85hd'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uk85hd/just_want_to_vent_about_the_tragic_condition_of/</li>

Telangana had a GDP growth of 11.2% compared to Kerala's GDP growth of 6.8%.  With high literacy and HDI, it would be a lot easier for Kerala to industrialize compared to other states.

Don’t follow the news like it is religion because it will poison your mind. At the end of the day, no politician is going to come save you and building the model samaj takes time, just one act getting passed or repealed doesn’t make/break the nation overnight. You only got you and your community to look out for. Choose wisely who you surround yourself with in terms of friends and tell everyone else against you to bhad mein jaa. There is one lesson I learnt from going to shaka and it is that we have to be proactive in our work rather than reactive. I’ll give you a few examples:\n\n* You see news of Khalistanis or Islamists pelting stones and brandishing swords, giving threats towards people who speak out against them. Your rage is justified but don’t seethe behind a screen. Hit the gym, do some cardio, learn arms training and self-defense so that if you get into an uncomfortable situation like that, you will be able to defend yourself if authorities fail to act in time.\n* You see bullshit claims about our community or faith online, rebut if you want to but I would suggest you drop arguing with internet strangers. Internet makes all the filters go off allowing the uneducated to speak like they are scholars. Instead losing brain cells over pseudoliberals pulling shit out of their asses, go read our vast literary collection and take counsel of scholars to help guide you. Then teach your community/family.\n* You see some new development that may be good/bad economy wise. Congratulate/loathe it, but the nation’s affairs move on and so should you. Focus on your career or whatever you do and strive for excellence in it so that the people see you as an example. People will do anything for success and once they see kattar bhakts getting to the top, they will connect the dots. Get out and earn big bucks for you, your family, and your community.\n\nThe Indic Wing is known for doing shit in real life. Talk is cheap, especially online.

It is *your* decision who you want to spend the rest of your life with and no one can say otherwise.\n\nNow, with that ground rule, let\'s go with the assumption that you and your spouse have mutually decided that one of you will stay at home and the other will bring home money for the family. \n\nThere are many parts to a relationship and sharing the running of a household. Tasks need to be given to each contributing party. Ideally, *a 50-50 split* is what people are going for. And if the household\'s split is that one person earns and the other person takes care of the house, they are still contributing to the house. Without the person taking care of the house, the breadwinner would not be able to put all their time into working at their salaried job.\n\nI see so many complaints about divorce in this country. And yes, I will admit that they are made to give the woman more power during a divorce, which is bad. I want to see equality in the legal system and I will always support the idea of giving men and women equal child support rights and equal marriage laws. But alimony resulting in a 50% loss in assets is not a power women have over men. That is what is owed to them when they first got married and that is what is being given to them. Please do not try to argue that it\'s somehow only the husband\'s money when he earned it from splitting the household\'s chores into breadwinning and homemaking. And I would say the same if a woman complained about a SAHD "stealing" 50% of her money in alimony during a divorce.'<br />Author: 'Mathsu_1217'  id: 'ujq4qh'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ujq4qh/hot_take_homemakers_are_owed_50_of_assets_in_a/</li>

Or worked out?\n\n\nDoesn't necessarily have to be the gym. Sports? Yoga? Anything?\n\n\nOkay let me take a look at your body. Are you in shape? Do you try to be?\n\n\nMy mother always thought gym is for 'goondas' and people who fight, and not for us 'ghar ke bachhe' who should focus on studying and be nice and good people who go to jobs and eat oily junk and come back with a pot belly that gets larger by the day and a posture that gets worse by the night. \n\n\nIn schools, we used to have only 1 PT period which also used to get cancelled often due to . Sports used to be looked down upon because 'cricket ke alawa koi aur sport karne me kaha hai paisa' and you miss out on the good habits too. Our pseudo-national sport is Cricket which is honestly the laziest sport in existence, unless you're the one bowling the average running and activity you do is minimal.\n\n\n\nYou look at a Hritik Roshan and think to yourself the guy is a 'Greek God' and the body just isn't doable, the only ones you know who are in shape are Haryanvi wrestlers who you think will only end up as 'bodyguards' so why bother right?\n\n\nThis is the small town/middle class growing up people usually have. Let me tell you I was the same, I arrived in Europe last year and during this match between my city's team and another 'football' team, we defeated them and everyone in the bar had their shirts out. Granted it's a beach city but all the guys had abs, and looked pretty much in shape. The life expectancy in my city is big, and these guys go to the gym like they brush the teeth, exercise culture is BIG and that got me in the mood as well.\n\n\nI got mine in 4 months because I asked around and got obsessed (Y'know, you being the average of 5 people you hang around and all that?) and I got in a pretty good shape. Granted I used to play football back in Delhi too but now I was in the BEST shape of my life. The benefits:\n\n\n1. and the biggest motivator for guys. Does getting in shape helps with girls? Oh yes it does. I was on a rampage in bars and clubs when it comes to the ladies. They'll want to feel your newly formed biceps and will have broad eyes while talking to you, and you feel awesome anyway because of working out. Win-win!\n\n\n2. This doesn't need to be stated but you'll stay healthy and any fitness related activity has an added benefit that your diet will automatically get fixed (because, well, you'd want to get better at the activity and you will suck if you've only consumed calories).\n\n\n3. You won't feel depressed 24/7, because guess what? Working out releases serotonin which is the 'happy chemical' and combined with a fuller more nutritious diet, you'll feel like smiling all day long.\n\n\n4. Reddit's favorite two rules: Be attractive and don't be unattractive? You'll get to live them. The shirts will fit better, you'll look fuller and you'll get way more compliments than ever.\n\n\n5. You'll be able to make quality friends who will call you out on your bad habits and who're as positive as you are.\n\n\n\nSo if you can, get a cheap gym membership or better yet do anything that gets you up on your ass.

I currently live in an empty flat in Delhi which is owned by my elder sister's husband, so I have not really considered talking about the relationship to my parents, only my elder brother who lives in Hyderabad knows that I am dating a girl but he doesn't know anything else (like her religion and education and all). We were talking yesterday and he told me some guy got killed yesterday for some interfaith marriage issue and I decided to look more into that case and now I am scared as shit. But should I do? Should we both tell our parents about our relationship? I don't think anyone in her family knows about the relationship except her younger sister who once came to watch movie with our office friend circle. I don't know about her family but I don't think my mother will approve of our relationship. Should I tell my parents about it?"<br />Author: 'bonk_time'  id: 'ujjnn8'<br />Score:98<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ujjnn8/worried_about_my_interfaith_relationship_i_am/</li>

As for the non-Muslims, use your discretion to see who is a bad Muslim and who isn\'t... the bad ones will be those with a patriarchal mindset and who in general refuse to accept the progress of society where Islam\'s reservations against things like the LGBTQ+ community, and certain parts of its law will not work.\n\n2) Islam is not the perfect religion but all arguments aside the only thing I can assure you as a fact is that Quran does not ask us to kill people of other religions... the war like references you see are in context to ancient times when followers of Islam were tortured to death so the prophets had to retaliate... and as for the "kill non - Muslims" verses that you find, please read a few lines before them to understand the context because either they did it first, or it is the description of what happens in Hell. We are told to retaliate when attacked... and Muslims who attacks first have taken those same verses out of context.\n\n3) As for the incident in question, we are not allowed to marry anyone who is not one of the [People of the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_Book), so even if the man was or was not one of them, what they did was absolutely disgusting and no punishment is too light for them.'<br />Author: 'f_stred'  id: 'uj1bxa'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uj1bxa/my_thoughts_on_islam_and_muslims_final_post/</li>

First, it was a rickshaw driver in Puri who gave me a 50  Rupee note which was darkish blue in comparison to the real one and second, a shopkeeper in my locality who handed me a 20 rupee bill which was pretty well made except for the paper, which was rather coarse in texture and the borders were misaligned with the ink of serial number clearly visible on the backside and was a dead giveaway. Both of these fellas were fairly nonchalant after I asked them to exchange it and promptly swapped it with a real one without any query, which made their scam pretty clear. Next time I'm coming across fake bills I'm gonna  take some action. Watch out for all the notes you hand out, and especially for the ones you take."<br />Author: 'kingjames1992'  id: 'ui8zfo'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ui8zfo/beware_of_the_fake_banknotes_in_circulation/</li>

Like a good divide-and-conquer strategy, when enough states (which may include states other than just the BJP rules ones) have completed their implementation of UCC, the central government can simply implement it nationally, reducing the risk of opposition (like the opposition to CAA). Although, this is a much slower process than "ek jhatke me UCC la diya".\n\nI feel like every major law that may potentially spark riots on implementation (and thereby increasing the risk of being painted as the oppressors by the western media), must be enacted state-by-state first, and then turn it a nationwide law.'<br />Author: 'Cyberpsychic'  id: 'ui2ph8'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ui2ph8/a_statewise_imposition_of_ucc_may_be_better_than/</li>

Every phone call, every financial transaction you made with a credit card, every webpage you have viewed is now part of this file. Every Facebook post.... every tweet... every Tumblr post... even your e-mails are laid out in this file. Even if you are fine with this, many people are not. Do you want all your sensitive information laid bare to the government for the small chance that it actually helps?\n\nThe possibility of innocent lives bein ruined is just too great. The government is not infallible. They make mistakes and our constitutionally protected civil liberties are intended to protect us from those mistakes. For example in the USA The [HUAC hearings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee) destroyed peoples lives. Imagine that level of paranoia applied with modern electronic surveillance. The proximity of your cell-phone to a terrorist at a mall might have been enough information to ruin your life.\n\nIt would be naïve to pretend that any government is unbiased and impartial. All governments are partisan, and in India, doubly so. This could be used as an excuse to detain protestors or dissidents, labeling them as anti nationals and threats to national security. This could be the road to internet censorship and thought policing.\n\nAnother argument that I find lacking is "If you have nothing to hide, the you have nothing to worry about"\n\nLet\'s follow these sequence of events:\n\n1. Government introduces more and more monitoring. You\'re doing nothing illegal, you have nothing to hide, you don\'t protest, the majority of the public either do nothing, or vote in favor.\n2. Government then begins making more and more activities illegal; now you do have something to hide, yet no way to hide it.\n\nThis is the scenario I worry about when Governments continue to introduce ways to monitor what their citizens do.\n\nA poem titled [First They Came](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came...) by Martin Niemöller perfectly summarizes what is wrong with this argument .\n\nLastly I would like to say one thing. If you support this law because today your government is in power, what will you do when tomorrow, the government you oppose, is in power and uses this same precedent to attack you?'<br />Author: 'Yobro_49'  id: 'ui181h'<br />Score:203<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ui181h/why_regardless_of_you_political_leanings_you/</li>

This is why making people to learn more language seems like a pointless exercise. You might be well off learning C++/ Python etc.\n\nTo tackle this I propose a simple reform. Remove Optional subjects in UPSC and replace them with two compulsory Indian languages. Assess the students at Class X level. The split may be done this way: Divide the languages into the major categories: Indo-European, Dravidian, Languages of NE and so on. Aspirants must choose two languages from groups not belonging to their mother tongue.\n\nSince every year lakhs of students appear for this exam and the civil services hold high prestige, will motivate more people to learn more languages on their own. So in total 4 language papers (mother tongue, English, two optional languages) and make the marks part of final scoring so that people genuinely study. \n\nAdditionally would make it easier to serve the people if local language is spoken by higher authorities.'<br />Author: 'ragavsn01'  id: 'uhbbcf'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uhbbcf/a_way_to_make_people_learn_more_languages/</li>

What things, what energies, what type of facilities, services, gov etc. Here is the sub [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\nYou can do this with anything. You can do this for your life, for your self image, for your family, for your marriage, for your community, for your business. Or for the Earth. Learn to connect within (or in your heart) and find out what you really want and learn to talk about it and create it more and more. It happens!\n\nOr learn to think outside of the box! Or think in a Higher, clearer, more joyful way!\n\nPlease read the post below. This is how the idea for this sub came about! (This will only take 5 mins to read. So please read it fully! )\n\n**Do you Love Bharat, India and Sanatani, Please read this post! This is a Must Read post for all Hindus and others who really Love and care about Bharat and our future! Please Help Make this post go viral!**\n\nNamaskaram,\n\nMost people here may know who Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi is. He had done ghar wapsi to Hinduism - he was previously the chairman of Shia Waqf Board and held a very high post in Shia muslim religion. His muslim name was Wasim Rizvi. He is currently in jail. Because he has done more for Hinduism, Hindutva and Bharat in current times than I think anyone else I know of, to awaken us all and to warn us about what he feels is coming in Bharat. And a very powerful lobby of Muslim politicians, the D gang and foreign money want him locked up forever or dead. His chances of getting out of jail anytime soon are very slim due to this lobby and politicians.\n\nAfter seeing many videos about him on Youtube, I was feeling very sad because no one was doing anything for him. I wanted to do something. I was thinking of a way to spread his story, to educate many people about who this amazing person is and what he was trying to do for us. I was thinking, is there a way for this to go viral so it can reach ??? maybe Vivek Agnihotri, Kangana Renaut, maybe wealthy Indians in other countries who care and want to do something.\n\nI sincerely believe that a renaissance or Spiritual awakening is happening and is very essential in Bharat. People need to wake up now and get involved (which is happening due to Kashmir Files movie, etc). We have got to wake up the Hindu masses and the national and spiritual consciousness. Because if we don't, I sincerely believe that we are heading towards civil war in this country. And a lot of hardship, misery or suffering for tons of people.\n\nI also wanted to share a few words about myself. My name is Bobby Luthra. I love Bharat and I thank God that I was born in a Hindu family. I am so, so grateful. I have been Spiritually minded since a young age (although not religious). I have lived outside of India since a young age, mostly in the US. Now I am in Delhi, taking care of my 92yo mother. I don't know and have never been involved with Jitendra Tyagi or the Hindu saints (Swami Yeti Narasimhanand, and Swami Amritanand) who appear with him in his videos. I have only been watching the videos online.\n\nI also know that a major shift in consciousness is happening in humanity in current times. All these accelerated global events that are happening since 2019 (pandemic, Ukraine war, being on brink of ww3, etc). Then all these events happening in Bharat such as Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots, the attacks on Hindu processions in 7 states and I have heard in over 100+ locations. And so so much more. What the heck is happening? I believe this is all part of the Spiritual awakening of humanity. The awakening is happening and so needed! I will talk more about this further down below.\n\nI am providing some must see videos about Jitendar Tyagi below. I believe Mr Tyagi has done everything out of Love, Truth and morality, to awaken all of us to the truth about Islam and Mohammed. He wrote a book about Mohammed when he was still Wasim Rizvi, by pulling together all the facts about Mohammed from authentic muslim sources such as Hadith, etc. Then he called all the Muslim religious leaders to debate with him about what was written in the book. Not one person came forward. He has never done anything out of malicious intent, only for the sake of truth. And for true caring and compassion and brotherly Love for everyone in Bharat.\n\nI also think that most Hindus and Sanatanis are asleep. We have little power left. No one in Bharat knows about Mr. Tyagi or cares to do anything about it. The Uttarakhand AAIMS doctors have said he is suffering from heart disease and needs to be out of jail because they can’t operate on him in jail. There is very good chance he may die in jail. He is still very young, I think in his late 40s. If no Sanatani comes forward and helps him, I think this will be a great injustice. And great shame on us! The 2 Swamis who are trying to help him have almost run out of money. We need people to step forward and act - and fight for justice!\n\nI am not involved with Mr Tyagi or any of these people. But I am a Spiritual person and I felt I had to do something. That is why I started working on a plan and writing this post. I did this only out of Love for Hinduism and Bharat. I received a Spiritual plan which I believe is magnificent. It will change tons of people’s consciousness in a massive way in Bharat. It’s an enormous vision! That’s why I urge everyone to read what I have written here totally. Especially if you are open to Spirituality or are being called to do something. Do not skip over anything I have written here. I believe this can reach a lot of people, and cause massive awakening in people. If you like this, please help this post and message to go viral! I am creating a blog, FB groups, Reddit groups, Twitter, Youtube channel, Instagram, etc, etc. I sincerely believe we all need to do something, otherwise Bharat is in trouble. I went within and asked for a solution, and this is what I received from Spirit!\n\nIf you are not too familiar with Jitendra Narayan Tyagi's story, then please watch these videos below. Please take the time to see them. Then please read below the videos about the powerful vision that I received for Bharat.\n\n**FIRST PLEASE WATCH THESE VIDEOS**\n\nWasim Rizvi becomes Jitendra Tyagi - What made him convert (10 mins)[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg)\n\nWasim Rizvi sharing his views on Mohammad and talking about his book to a Muslim anchor named Amber Zaidi.

Please take the time - your future depends upon it!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04)\n\nI sincerely believe that 99% of the Sanatani or Hindu community are asleep. Because no one pays attention to what is really important that is happening. We have lost our true Power. Because we have lost our innate Spirituality. Spirituality is the essence of Bharat. All the great discoveries of mankind came from Bharat! Without the number 0, there could be no science, technology, engineering. Do you know that? Now I believe this country may go down the drain or be engulfed in civil war. That is why I am writing this and will be involved with this mission and to fully create this vision. To awaken as many people as possible! Please follow what I am doing and like my post!\n\nPlease join my Subreddit - Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0 (link is at bottom of this post)! I see New Bharat or Bharat 2.0 as Full of Love and Spirit! Our Power will come from that!\n\nI believe All the problems in our world and in Bharat stem from the fact that there is not enough Love in our country and world. Humanity has forgotten how to live in Love! Look at everything that is happening - the Pandemic, all the war and destruction. It has one root cause - not enough Love. Not enough Love. Can you see that? In my Subreddit on Bharat 2.0 we will impart simple ways all of us can restore Love or Divine Love back into our lives! I urge everyone to spend some part of every day focusing on something, anything you really Love! Something you can work on selflessly from your Heart because you truly Love it! Soon your life will start flowing with Divine Love! And our communities and nation also will start flowing with Divine Love like a massive river!\n\n(This is exactly how I started working on this mission to help free Jitendar Tyagi and wake up the masses! I am also a very busy guy. I initially hesitated. I felt what can I do? How can I do anything? But I felt I need to do this out of my pure selfless Love for Bharat and for Hinduism. This is like the Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Arjun and Krishna happened inside me. And I eventually surrendered to Krishna’s play or Divine Will.)\n\nWe are born out of Love and we are returning back to Love! Love is who we are! Love is our true nature! God is Love! Have you heard people say my religion is Love! This is what Bharat and our world is returning back to more and more now. All the chaos you are seeing currently will soon be gone! But we’ve got to do our part. And fill our lives and mind and heart with Love! We have to do this daily! Work on something daily selflessly. Please, please do that! (If you can’t think of anything to work on selflessly from your heart, just spread this post! This can spread the Love and Light!)\n\nI urge you now to do 3 things (please do 1 and if you have more time do 2 and 3 also)\n\n**1** Spread my post to others - Everyone, please do this! This is the only part that I want everyone to do. Because we need everyone to start waking up now and start understanding what's really going on in Bharat! #2 and #3 are optional. Do them if you have the time.\n\nDon't worry if you don't understand anything right now. Just read it a few times and you will start getting it very soon.\n\n**2** If you have time, start going through more of what I am writing in my Subreddit “Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0” Just start reading more and seeing the videos. Then you can learn more. Here is my Sub: [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\n**3** Start learning more of the methods I am teaching. They are very simple and powerful Spiritual methods. Like the 4 min meditation. This meditation is only 4 mins and it has changed my life! And I know this will change your life also if you learn it! (This helps in all areas of life - relationships, work, job, money, health.)\n\nPlease help the Swamiji’s to help Jitendra Tyagi! Just see the videos in this post above about how they can be reached! Please help them in any ways you can!\n\nI will soon be having zoom calls weekly also! And start talking about this type of stuff.I am feeling that currently we in Bharat have 2 choices. Either we move forwards towards total Love. Or total chaos and destruction. It’s our choice! My mission is to help people understand how we can move forwards towards total Love! (And joy and happiness and all good things!)\n\nIn my Subreddit, we also focus on spreading Sadhguru’s SaveSoil movement! That is also very essential! So please spread this post so more and more people join our Subreddit!\n\nThank you!\n\nPranam!\n\nBobby\n\n[r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)"<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'uh6e79'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uh6e79/new_sub_lets_create_new_bharat_bharat_20_a_wish/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Language Issue'<br />Body: "I am here to present an argument on the hindi vs south indian languages debate\n\nMy first point.\n\nIn India  we have the peculiar issue that 1 language is spoken in one way or the other by almost 60% of her people (this includes those who speak hindi as first language , second language and third language). If i take the understanding aspect ie people who dont speak hindi but can understand a conversation in hindi it will defo be a higher value. So to give a small explanation we can say that except the 5 southern states hindi is understood by a majority of our population.\n\n This brings me to my second point.\n\nLanguage is something that cannot , will not and should not be imposed on any crowd. People should never tell let south indians learn hindi we will learn tamil or telugu ig. Because thats unofficially making hindi our national language. This then brings us to our language disconnect between north and south. It would be shameful if north indians and south indians use english to communicate with each other (which ig is the most popular way). \n\nPoint 3.\n\nThe language system as it is currently is flawed. I've studied in Bangalore and here initially i had English, Hindi, Kannada. As the languages i had to study. Later on it became English, Hindi, Sanskrit and finally in my 10th grade it was English and Sanskrit. English being a constant here is not something i am a fan of but i'll let that slide. If u see i have technically learnt 4 languages in school but i can only hold conversation in 2 English and Tamil. Yes that means 3 of the languages i have learnt are almost of no use to me as i cant even speak in them for more than 2 minutes. So here we should have a new language system something on the lines of English, Common Language, Mother Tongue(at least for a few years). But lo and behold me learning my mother tongue is not possible everywhere right ? Also the way i speak tamil at home is wayyy different than that taught in school so it still makes no sense(here i am referring to dialects that impact the way one assimilates a language).   Where does this finally leave us ??? I am thinking of Eng + common Lang + the states language + families encouraging reading of great works in your mother tongue. This sounds like a layout that could work and not break the society further. Now the most awaited common language debate well my personal understanding is sanskrit is the mother of all languages in india (honestly idk about the deal of tamil being older and all ) so theoretically we can go ahead with sanskrit as common language. Yes it is not spoken widely, yes its very tough to get people to start speaking a language they barely know about but with time change is possible. The brits made so many of us learn english in just 200-300 years sanskrit is in our blood why cant we revive this language? \n\nSorry if the argument structure is not that great \n\npls comment your thoughts down below \n\nJai Hind Vande Mataram"<br />Author: 'ajn8304'  id: 'uh6drp'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uh6drp/the_language_issue/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Stop using sugar. Start using stevia: the safest plant-based sweetener available'<br />Body: "Guys, use stevia instead of sugar. It's the safest sweetener in the market. Unlike aspartame, a super dangerous substance which the FDA objected to multiple times but was finally allowed due to pressure from Donald Rumsfeld (yes that guy), stevia comes from a plant and is not dangerous at all. Aspartame is sold in India with the photo of a famous Indian chef. He should be ashamed of himself for promoting such a product. Just google aspartame side effects. You will never touch it again. Aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and probably a lot deadly, too. It is used in soft drinks and energy drinks.\n\nCoffee doesn't taste as good with stevia, so you can use 3 stevia tablets and 1 teaspoon of sugar. I find that tea with stevia is amazing, almost no change from sugar-sweetened tea.\n\n&gt;What foods contain aspartame\n\nProducts with aspartame\nWhenever a product is labeled “sugar-free,” that usually means it has an artificial sweetener in place of sugar. While not all sugar-free products contain aspartame, it’s still one of the most popular sweeteners. It’s widely available in a number of packaged goods.\n\nSome examples of aspartame-containing products include:\n\ndiet soda\n\nsugar-free ice cream\n\nreduced-calorie fruit juice\ngum\n\nyogurt\n\nsugarless candy\n\nUsing other sweeteners can help you limit your aspartame intake. However, if you want to avoid aspartame altogether, you’ll also need to make sure to look out for it in packaged goods. Aspartame is most often labeled as containing phenylalanine.\n\n&gt;Phenylketonuria\nPeople with PKU have too much phenylalanine in their blood. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid found in protein sources such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. It’s also one of the two ingredients of aspartame.\n\nPeople with this condition aren’t able to properly process phenylalanine. If you have this condition, aspartame is highly toxic.\n\n&gt;Tardive dyskinesia\n\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) is thought to be a side effect of some schizophrenia medications. The phenylalanine in aspartame may precipitate the uncontrolled muscle movements of TD.\n\n&gt;Other\n&gt;Anti-aspartame activists claim there’s a link between aspartame and a multitude of ailments, including:\n\ncancer\n\nseizures\n\nheadaches\n\ndepression\n\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\ndizziness\n\nweight gain\n\nbirth defects\n\nlupus\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nmultiple sclerosis (MS)\n\nResearch is ongoing to confirm or invalidate connections between these ailments and aspartame, but currently there is still inconsistent outcomes in studies.\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/aspartame-side-effects#side-effects\n\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322266#side-effects\n\n&gt;Aspartame (α-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine-o-methyl ester), an artificial sweetener, has been linked to behavioral and cognitive problems. Possible neurophysiological symptoms include learning problems, headache, seizure, migraines, irritable moods, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The consumption of aspartame, unlike dietary protein, can elevate the levels of phenylalanine and aspartic acid in the brain. These compounds can inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which are known regulators of neurophysiological activity. Aspartame acts as a chemical stressor by elevating plasma cortisol levels and causing the production of excess free radicals. High cortisol levels and excess free radicals may increase the brains vulnerability to oxidative stress which may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral health. We reviewed studies linking neurophysiological symptoms to aspartame usage and conclude that aspartame may be responsible for adverse neurobehavioral health outcomes. Aspartame consumption needs to be approached with caution due to the possible effects on neurobehavioral health. Whether aspartame and its metabolites are safe for general consumption is still debatable due to a lack of consistent data. More research evaluating the neurobehavioral effects of aspartame are required.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28198207/\n\nScience Says Aspartame Is Worse Than Sugar\n\nhttps://www.eatthis.com/aspartame-side-effects/\n\nhttps://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-health/dangerous-aspartame-side-effects-in-children-zbcz1404/"<br />Author: 'Cute-Beat-98'  id: 'uh686c'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uh686c/stop_using_sugar_start_using_stevia_the_safest/</li>

Let's learn to think in a different way!"<br />Body: "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cax9q3x0u5x81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57305d10a9466d01c6d0318ef806bbc3f4e2b1e5\n\nWe created this Sub to talk about what we would like to see more of in New Bharat! Or Bharat 2.0! What things, what energies, what type of facilities, services, gov etc. Here is the sub [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\nYou can do this with anything. You can do this for your life, for your self image, for your family, for your marriage, for your community, for your business. Or for the Earth. Learn to connect within (or in your heart) and find out what you really want and learn to talk about it and create it more and more. It happens!\n\nOr learn to think outside of the box! Or think in a Higher, clearer, more joyful way!\n\nPlease read the post below. This is how the idea for this sub came about! (This will only take 5 mins to read. So please read it fully! )\n\n**Do you Love Bharat, India and Sanatani, Please read this post! This is a Must Read post for all Hindus and others who really Love and care about Bharat and our future! Please Help Make this post go viral!**\n\nNamaskaram,\n\nMost people here may know who Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi is. He had done ghar wapsi to Hinduism - he was previously the chairman of Shia Waqf Board and held a very high post in Shia muslim religion. His muslim name was Wasim Rizvi. He is currently in jail. Because he has done more for Hinduism, Hindutva and Bharat in current times than I think anyone else I know of, to awaken us all and to warn us about what he feels is coming in Bharat. And a very powerful lobby of Muslim politicians, the D gang and foreign money want him locked up forever or dead. His chances of getting out of jail anytime soon are very slim due to this lobby and politicians.\n\nAfter seeing many videos about him on Youtube, I was feeling very sad because no one was doing anything for him. I wanted to do something. I was thinking of a way to spread his story, to educate many people about who this amazing person is and what he was trying to do for us. I was thinking, is there a way for this to go viral so it can reach ??? maybe Vivek Agnihotri, Kangana Renaut, maybe wealthy Indians in other countries who care and want to do something.\n\nI sincerely believe that a renaissance or Spiritual awakening is happening and is very essential in Bharat. People need to wake up now and get involved (which is happening due to Kashmir Files movie, etc). We have got to wake up the Hindu masses and the national and spiritual consciousness. Because if we don't, I sincerely believe that we are heading towards civil war in this country. And a lot of hardship, misery or suffering for tons of people.\n\nI also wanted to share a few words about myself. My name is Bobby Luthra. I love Bharat and I thank God that I was born in a Hindu family. I am so, so grateful. I have been Spiritually minded since a young age (although not religious). I have lived outside of India since a young age, mostly in the US. Now I am in Delhi, taking care of my 92yo mother. I don't know and have never been involved with Jitendra Tyagi or the Hindu saints (Swami Yeti Narasimhanand, and Swami Amritanand) who appear with him in his videos. I have only been watching the videos online.\n\nI also know that a major shift in consciousness is happening in humanity in current times. All these accelerated global events that are happening since 2019 (pandemic, Ukraine war, being on brink of ww3, etc). Then all these events happening in Bharat such as Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots, the attacks on Hindu processions in 7 states and I have heard in over 100+ locations. And so so much more. What the heck is happening? I believe this is all part of the Spiritual awakening of humanity. The awakening is happening and so needed! I will talk more about this further down below.\n\nI am providing some must see videos about Jitendar Tyagi below. I believe Mr Tyagi has done everything out of Love, Truth and morality, to awaken all of us to the truth about Islam and Mohammed. He wrote a book about Mohammed when he was still Wasim Rizvi, by pulling together all the facts about Mohammed from authentic muslim sources such as Hadith, etc. Then he called all the Muslim religious leaders to debate with him about what was written in the book. Not one person came forward. He has never done anything out of malicious intent, only for the sake of truth. And for true caring and compassion and brotherly Love for everyone in Bharat.\n\nI also think that most Hindus and Sanatanis are asleep. We have little power left. No one in Bharat knows about Mr. Tyagi or cares to do anything about it. The Uttarakhand AAIMS doctors have said he is suffering from heart disease and needs to be out of jail because they can’t operate on him in jail. There is very good chance he may die in jail. He is still very young, I think in his late 40s. If no Sanatani comes forward and helps him, I think this will be a great injustice. And great shame on us! The 2 Swamis who are trying to help him have almost run out of money. We need people to step forward and act - and fight for justice!\n\nI am not involved with Mr Tyagi or any of these people. But I am a Spiritual person and I felt I had to do something. That is why I started working on a plan and writing this post. I did this only out of Love for Hinduism and Bharat. I received a Spiritual plan which I believe is magnificent. It will change tons of people’s consciousness in a massive way in Bharat. It’s an enormous vision! That’s why I urge everyone to read what I have written here totally. Especially if you are open to Spirituality or are being called to do something. Do not skip over anything I have written here. I believe this can reach a lot of people, and cause massive awakening in people. If you like this, please help this post and message to go viral! I am creating a blog, FB groups, Reddit groups, Twitter, Youtube channel, Instagram, etc, etc. I sincerely believe we all need to do something, otherwise Bharat is in trouble. I went within and asked for a solution, and this is what I received from Spirit!\n\nIf you are not too familiar with Jitendra Narayan Tyagi's story, then please watch these videos below. Please take the time to see them. Then please read below the videos about the powerful vision that I received for Bharat.\n\n**FIRST PLEASE WATCH THESE VIDEOS**\n\nWasim Rizvi becomes Jitendra Tyagi - What made him convert (10 mins)[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg)\n\nWasim Rizvi sharing his views on Mohammad and talking about his book to a Muslim anchor named Amber Zaidi. (55 mins) Every person including non-Muslims need to read this book by Wasim Rizvi about the truth about Islam and Mohammed. Wasim Rizvi wrote this book to awaken all of us in this great land! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls)\n\nHelpless is a wonderful movie made by Wasim Rizvi on Pakistani Hindus (if you like Kashmiri Files movie, you must see this film too! Absolutely Must See!)[ (1.13 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4)\n\nManushi India about most recent news about Jitendra Tyagi and how difficult it is to get him out of jail due to the powerful lobby.

These are letters being received by Swamiji from Jitendra Tyagi from jail. This video touched me so much and this is the reason I was motivated that I had to do something about it. That is how I started working on this post and my full vision. (1.12 min) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4)\n\nThis video is an interview with Swami Yeti Narasinghanand ji. How he sees the situation of Hindus in India &amp; globally. (55 mins) This is a must see video of the Swami who was responsible for Jitendra Tyagi’s ghar wapsi. Every Hindu needs to see this video! Please take the time - your future depends upon it!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04)\n\nI sincerely believe that 99% of the Sanatani or Hindu community are asleep. Because no one pays attention to what is really important that is happening. We have lost our true Power. Because we have lost our innate Spirituality. Spirituality is the essence of Bharat. All the great discoveries of mankind came from Bharat! Without the number 0, there could be no science, technology, engineering. Do you know that? Now I believe this country may go down the drain or be engulfed in civil war. That is why I am writing this and will be involved with this mission and to fully create this vision. To awaken as many people as possible! Please follow what I am doing and like my post!\n\nPlease join my Subreddit - Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0 (link is at bottom of this post)! I see New Bharat or Bharat 2.0 as Full of Love and Spirit! Our Power will come from that!\n\nI believe All the problems in our world and in Bharat stem from the fact that there is not enough Love in our country and world. Humanity has forgotten how to live in Love! Look at everything that is happening - the Pandemic, all the war and destruction. It has one root cause - not enough Love. Not enough Love. Can you see that? In my Subreddit on Bharat 2.0 we will impart simple ways all of us can restore Love or Divine Love back into our lives! I urge everyone to spend some part of every day focusing on something, anything you really Love! Something you can work on selflessly from your Heart because you truly Love it! Soon your life will start flowing with Divine Love! And our communities and nation also will start flowing with Divine Love like a massive river!\n\n(This is exactly how I started working on this mission to help free Jitendar Tyagi and wake up the masses! I am also a very busy guy. I initially hesitated. I felt what can I do? How can I do anything? But I felt I need to do this out of my pure selfless Love for Bharat and for Hinduism. This is like the Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Arjun and Krishna happened inside me. And I eventually surrendered to Krishna’s play or Divine Will.)\n\nWe are born out of Love and we are returning back to Love! Love is who we are! Love is our true nature! God is Love! Have you heard people say my religion is Love! This is what Bharat and our world is returning back to more and more now. All the chaos you are seeing currently will soon be gone! But we’ve got to do our part. And fill our lives and mind and heart with Love! We have to do this daily! Work on something daily selflessly. Please, please do that! (If you can’t think of anything to work on selflessly from your heart, just spread this post! This can spread the Love and Light!)\n\nI urge you now to do 3 things (please do 1 and if you have more time do 2 and 3 also)\n\n**1** Spread my post to others - Everyone, please do this! This is the only part that I want everyone to do. Because we need everyone to start waking up now and start understanding what's really going on in Bharat! #2 and #3 are optional. Do them if you have the time.\n\nDon't worry if you don't understand anything right now. Just read it a few times and you will start getting it very soon.\n\n**2** If you have time, start going through more of what I am writing in my Subreddit “Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0” Just start reading more and seeing the videos. Then you can learn more. Here is my Sub: [r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)\n\n**3** Start learning more of the methods I am teaching. They are very simple and powerful Spiritual methods. Like the 4 min meditation. This meditation is only 4 mins and it has changed my life! And I know this will change your life also if you learn it! (This helps in all areas of life - relationships, work, job, money, health.)\n\nPlease help the Swamiji’s to help Jitendra Tyagi! Just see the videos in this post above about how they can be reached! Please help them in any ways you can!\n\nI will soon be having zoom calls weekly also! And start talking about this type of stuff.I am feeling that currently we in Bharat have 2 choices. Either we move forwards towards total Love. Or total chaos and destruction. It’s our choice! My mission is to help people understand how we can move forwards towards total Love! (And joy and happiness and all good things!)\n\nIn my Subreddit, we also focus on spreading Sadhguru’s SaveSoil movement! That is also very essential! So please spread this post so more and more people join our Subreddit!\n\nThank you!\n\nPranam!\n\nBobby\n\n[r/LetsCreateBharat2\\_0](https://np.reddit.com/r/LetsCreateBharat2_0/)"<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'uh4jbq'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uh4jbq/lets_create_new_bharat_bharat_20_lets_learn_to/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A Short Chronology of the Modern Human in Indian Prehistory'<br />Body: '~ 300,000 years: The age of the earliest remains of a modern human, Homo sapiens, ever found– in a cave in Jebel Irhoud, about fifty kilometres from the city of Safi in Morocco. \n\n~ 180,000 years: The age of the earliest modern human fossil found outside of Africa– at a rock shelter in Misliya in north Israel. \n\n~ 70,000 years ago: Geneticists calculate that the earliest successful Out of Africa (OoA) migration happened around this time. This migration was termed ‘successful’ because these migrants are the ancestors of all of today’s non-African populations. (Earlier modern humans outside of Africa have not left a lineage that is detectable today.) The OoA migrants 70,000 years ago are likely to have taken the Southern Route that would have brought them from Africa (specifically, from modern-day Eritrea and Djibouti) into Asia (modern-day Yemen) through Bab el Mandeb at the southern tip of the Red Sea. \n\n~ 65,000 years ago: The OoA migrants reach India and are faced with a robust population of archaic humans. They perhaps take both an inland sub-Himalayan route and a coastal route, to keep themselves out of the way of other Homo species in the subcontinent who dominated central and southern India, and then move across the Indian subcontinent into south-east Asia, east Asia and Australia. \n\n60,000–40,000 years ago: The descendants of the OoA migrants populate central Asia and Europe over this period. \n\n~ 40,000 years ago: Neanderthals go extinct in Europe, with the Iberian peninsula in south-western Europe (modern-day Portugal and Spain) being their last refuge and stand. \n\n45,000–20,000 years ago: The First Indians, the descendants of the OoA migrants in the subcontinent, start using Microlithic technology, and their population increases dramatically in central and eastern India. South Asia becomes the place where ‘most of humanity’ lives. Modern humans move into what would have been long-established refuges of other Homo species in southern and central India. \n\n~ 16,000 years ago (14,000 BCE): Modern humans reach the Americas, the last major continent to be settled in by modern humans, after crossing Beringia, the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska. \n\n~ 7000 BCE: In a village that is today called Mehrgarh, at the foot of the Bolan Hills in Balochistan, a new agricultural settlement begins that would ultimately become one of the largest habitations of its period between the Indus and the Mediterranean. \n\n7000–3000 BCE: Migration of Iranian agriculturists from the Zagros region to south Asia leads to their mixing with the descendants of the First Indians sometime during this period. Geneticists estimate the mixing to have taken place at least by 4700 BCE to 3000 BCE. \n\n7000–2600 BCE: The Mehrgarh site shows evidence for cultivation of barley and wheat, and increasing consumption of domesticated animals. The site was abandoned somewhere between 2600 BCE and 2000 BCE. By then agricultural settlements had spread all across north-western India– in the Indus and Ghaggar–Hakra river valleys and in Gujarat. \n\n7000 BCE: From around this period there is evidence for rice harvesting and sedentary settlement at Lahuradewa in the Sant Kabir Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh in the Upper Ganga plain. The chronology of transition from harvesting wild rice to cultivating domesticated rice is not yet certain, but there is no doubt that Lahuradewa indicates experiments in agriculture were taking place at several places in south Asia around the same time and that Mehrgarh was not an isolated case. \n\n5500–2600 BCE: The Early Harappan era, which witnesses early agricultural settlements growing into towns with their own unique styles, such as Kalibangan and Rakhigarhi in India and Banawali and Rahman Dheri in Pakistan. \n\n3700–1500 BCE: Evidence of early agriculture starts to appear in different parts of India– eastern Rajasthan, southern India, the Vindhya region of central India, eastern India and the Swat valley of Kashmir. \n\n2600–1900 BCE: The Mature Harappan period, which sees many sites being newly built or rebuilt, and many existing sites being abandoned. There is also a visible and higher level of standardization across the region, with a common script, seals, motifs and weights. The transition from the Early Harappan to the Mature Harappan phase happened over four or five generations, or 100 to 150 years. \n\n2300–1700 BCE: The period of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC), a civilization centred on the Oxus river (also called Amu Darya) and covering today’s northern Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan. The BMAC had close trade and cultural relations with the Harappan Civilization. \n\n2100 BCE: A southward migration of pastoralists from the Kazakh Steppe, towards the southern central Asian regions that would today be called Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The migrants make an impact on the BMAC, but mostly bypass it and move towards south Asia throughout the second millennium BCE, as listed below (2000–1000 BCE). \n\n2000 BCE: Two major waves of migrations with their origin in China– after it had gone through the farming revolution and the resultant population surgereshape south-east Asia. The first one brings Austroasiatic languages, new plants and a new variety of rice to India after 2000 BCE. \n\n2000–1000 BCE: Multiple waves of Steppe pastoralist migrants from central Asia into south Asia, bringing Indo-European languages and new religious and cultural practices. \n\n1900–1300 BCE: The Late Harappan period that sees the decline and eventual disappearance of the Harappan Civilization, primarily due to the effects of a long drought that affected civilizations in west Asia, Egypt and China as well.'<br />Author: 'PhysicistAmar'  id: 'ugjxu1'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ugjxu1/a_short_chronology_of_the_modern_human_in_indian/</li>

India is an old civilization which is converting into a new nation state. This is highly exothermic. This heat is necessary because this leads to amalgamation.But the process makes fault lines fluid. **India has got all the fault lines -- ethnic, religious, cultural, linguistic and caste.**\n\n**Which is the most prominent issue threatening India\'s internal security?**\n\n**I consider infiltration of Bangladeshis the biggest internal security problem**. **It\'s the biggest because the government feels that it can do nothing about it** **.** **There is no military response, diplomatic responses have failed, border management is not effective and the legal response is not doable because two crore illegal people\'s adjudication will take 200 years**. Even then, you can take those adjudicated outsiders to the border, Bangladesh may not accept them. And even when they are accepted they come back after 15 days to a new destination in India.

But in a large number of cases the Bangladesh Rifles refuse to accept India\'s evidence.

It was noon. The journey ended at Jammu,” he says. Hussain is among the first Rohingya to have settled in Jammu’s Bhatindi 10 years ago.\n\n**Later, a senior officer in the intelligence wing of Jammu and Kashmir Police laughs off this explanation. “By all accounts, they boarded the Sealdah Express that crosses Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab before reaching Jammu. It’s an arduous two-day journey. Why did they not alight at any of the stations in between?”**\n\n**The new home of these runaways, ironically, is always Hindu-majority Jammu and never Muslim-majority Kashmir, the officer observes with a smirk as he produces a break-up of Rohingya settlements in the region. The Rohingya are scattered over 42 sites, Muslim-populated Bhatindi a home to the largest and oldest camp, housing 192 of the 1,548 Rohingya families in Jammu, as of January 2018.“You see a pattern?” . I pore over the list in reply. “They are being settled all over the region. Some areas have just two Rohingya families****. Many Army camps in Jammu city are now surrounded by them.”**\n\n**“It has come to our notice that some of them helped Pakistani militants trespass the Jammu border. You see, Rohingyas are experts in infiltration, they are deft in cutting the fence, they know tunneling, they are skilled in camouflage.”**\n\n**Security forces are increasingly noticing the use of the word ‘Burmi’ in conversations between militants. “Rakhine militants are known to have direct links with ISI \\[Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence\\] and we are not ruling this connection out. They have a victimhood narrative of being wronged by non-Muslims. There are definitive leads that Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba is trying to exploit them for carrying out terror activities in India and Bangladesh,” the officer says.**\n\n**X----------------------------------------------------------------X-------------------------------------------------------X-----------------------------------X-------------**\n\n[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-cases-of-infiltration-reported-along-bangladesh-border-mha-101638894853120.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-cases-of-infiltration-reported-along-bangladesh-border-mha-101638894853120.html)\n\n[https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-told-to-probe-illegal-rohingya-immigration-101642013090605.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-told-to-probe-illegal-rohingya-immigration-101642013090605.html)\n\n[https://swarajyamag.com/politics/union-home-ministry-uncovers-trans-border-illegal-immigration-racket-to-change-indias-demography-orders-nia-probe](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/union-home-ministry-uncovers-trans-border-illegal-immigration-racket-to-change-indias-demography-orders-nia-probe)\n\nX-------------------------------------------------------------------X------------------------------------------------X--------------------------------------X--------------\n\n[https://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/-chittagong-screening-cancelled-in-bangladesh\\_122759.html/amp](https://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/-chittagong-screening-cancelled-in-bangladesh_122759.html/amp)\n\n**(OLD 2003)**\n\n**The order came on a PIL filed by a city-based advocate in 2001 alleging that 28 lakh Bangladeshis were unauthorisedly living in Delhi and taking all the benefits of government schemes meant for bonafide citizens.**  \n \n\n**Alleging that lakhs of Bangladeshis were enrolled as voters here, the petitioner sought direction to the Centre and Delhi government and city police to detect and deport them.**  \n \n\n**DCP (HQ) T N Mohan submitted an affidavit explaining the problems faced by police in identifying Bangladeshis.

      <li>Title::: 'Some things to share'<br />Body: " \n\nHi. Recently due to all the incidents happening right now and the Hindu-Muslim dogfight going on, I as a Muslim, would like to clear things a few things up.\n\n1. We Muslims want to live in peace. We did not intend to offend any person/religion through the loudspeakers in our mosques.\n2. What you are seeing on news feeds is a small minority of our populace. Muslim population in India is 200+ million. The riots and stonings you are seeing are being done by a couple hundred or thousand people in total. That makes up, about 0.0023% of our total populace, and this is assuming the worst case scenario of 5000 such people exist, which is a number way off the mark considering the number of muslim-hindu fights in recent times are not more than the tens. The same story is for the other side as well\n3. For the azzan problems, I will clarify 2 things:\n4. The sentence “Allah is the greatest and no one is worthy of worship other than Him”, it is not a message to other religions to belittle their faith, but to the Muslims to always remember their God and not to defect away from him. We are not saying “Shiva is lesser than Allah”, but rather telling Muslims to continue believing in Allah.\n5. A better solution to the loudspeaker problem, rather than banning them, would be to take a survey of mosques in India, find the area of the muslim locality around them, and then set their volumes accordingly so that the speaker is heard only till where the muslim area is dense. If there are very few muslims living around a mosque then yes, prohibit them from using loudspeakers. And no loudspeakers near a hotel or commercial area. I think this solution will keep both sides satisfied.\n6. If you see a subreddit with the name “Islamists” in any part of their name, then please refrain from using their points for reference in an argument. Islamism is politicisation of the religion, something which disregards modern civilization’s outlook on society as well as a whole lot of manipulation of facts in the Quran. And if there's a subreddit of the name excluding “Islamist”, even then please ignore any kind of comments that make Islam look like it is based on war and hatred which it is not. This also bodes well for the Muslims as well. Do not take Hindu hate comments seriously, because you can go outside take a 5 min stroll and you will find that for that 1 hindu who is hating on Islam, there will be 10 more who will be very friendly with you.\n7. As for the Hijab situation, I would like everyone to know that they are to us, what the raksha sutra on the wrists are to Hindus, a religious garment worn due to religious obligation and nothing more. Make of this statement as you would like\n8. In this entire skirmish, both sides are equally at fault for instigating/provoking the other side into a fight. The things to watch out for, are the media and politicians. I would sincerely hope everyone gets to the bottom of every news report by doing their own research and understanding who is in the right and wrong. It is best if we do not jump to conclusions and spread misinformation.\n9. I sincerely request everyone to not generalise the entire populace of a religion based on the acts of a few fools. We should hope that this back and forth between the 2 communities does not end in irreversible damage or massacre of both sides.\n\nThat is all I would like to say. Not every religion is perfect and not every person is perfect. Yes, our religion has some laws that might look backdated to you or outrageous in their design, but please ask someone well versed in Islam and they will be able to tell you the true meaning behind each law. For example, the Triple Talaq method, which was banned in India, was actually a way to sort out things a lot more peacefully than it seemed. It was supposed to extend over a 3 month period where the Husband and Wife would try to find a solution to their problem before having a divorce, hence ‘Triple’ Talaq. But the uneducated masses just said ‘Talaq’ 3 times and left their wives, that too for the pettiest of things.

You are born in a state that lies south of the tropic of cancer. In one of the four states that people think are South India. You first learn your mother tongue, let\'s say its Kannada.   \nYou are not even three years old before which you are exposed to two more languages, say Telugu and Tamil. You pick up a few works when you play at their place and get a jist of what is being said even if you can\'t speak the tongue. You also listen to people speaking Malayalam and Tulu. \n\nBy age 5 you would have learnt around 3 languages as a necessity to speak to friends or make fun of them. Then comes school and you are force fed English and Hindi. (English is usually started at age 2 but parents don\'t stress out much once you get your A to Z and can say apple and mango.)  \nSome people (actually majority in each state) studying in schools are only exposed to their mother tongue with English around but not as important. Hindi is a pass subject, just get enough answers right and you pass sometimes with grace marks. \n\nBy the time you are in college or working age, you hear Hindi every now and then. Hindi is an alien or foreign language for many South Indians. Everyone knows it exists but not many know who speaks it (in non-urban areas). \n\nNow you are mixing with other states for college or work. One speaks Malayalam and one Tamil. You do understand some of what they are saying but not all. Its your office and you need to communicate, so you decide on the one language that is a neutral one, that though alien is commercial and advantageous &amp; future proof. English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish is the "Hindi" of Southern belt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish is the means of communication for educated South Indians. Ironically uneducated South Indians tend to learn all languages needed. A bus driver here might be more fluent and can even read atleast 3 to 4 languages. Lack of formal education pushes people to speak multiple tongues. I frequently encounter people who speak Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam fluently and I am amazed how are they good at all of them; compared to my toddler level expertise in half of those. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HINDI**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHindi is used differently by south Indians than in the upper parts of the country. I will talk about the latter in a different thread.   \n\nHindi is just one of 4 or 5 or 6 languages we encounter. It is not necessary nor is it a waste. It simply exists like the 50 buck note in the secret pocket of your wallet. You might need it some day but it is not today. \n\n**An Indian from one of the southern states when he/she speaks in Hindi is usually to low wage workers.** Construction workers, security guards, factory workers, farm labourers, cooks and waiters etc. They can\'t be expected to learn English to communicate so they are given benefit of doubt. Also the only instructions you need to give them are simple and work related, "kaam pe jao" "doctor ke paas jao" "khanana khao" " paise kal milenge" etc. You are not exactly going to sit with them and talk about your life over tea. I know it\'s harsh but it is the bitter elitist truth. \n\nNow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEducated Indians from the Northern belt when they come here, they tend to speak in Hindi which first of all confuses people here. Because you look educated but you are not talking in English. It takes some time to process that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It could also be the source of the widespread misnomer than they can never speak good English)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut like I said a lot of people here have some exposure to Hindi and some do more than minimal. You are the one they have saved that 50 buck note in their wallet and now they give you that. They see you struggle but they give you the benefit of doubt that you are educated so you will be able to belt out passable English and learn the local language in no time (basic level, not asking you to write novels).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeeks and months pass and people realize that you only know one Indian language, Hindi (also English) and it surprises them that you can\'t speak any other languages. They are also confused about your excuse that you are temporarily here, after 5 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is South Indians learn languages much faster, some even speak Bengali and Marathi. So it perplexes them that fellow Indians are struggling to learn the language of the state they are residing in, when will they move on to learn the neighboring states. Never. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis context is missed by many North of India Indians, that no one likes or hates Hindi, it\'s just another language. And it comes much lower in importance here.

You are born in a state that lies north of the tropic of cancer. You learn your mother tongue be it Gujurati, Rajasthani, Haryanvi, Bhojpuri etc but also Hindi since everyone speaks that.  \n\n\nBy the time you are three you are speaking both your mother tongue and Hindi. In some cases Hindi is your mother tongue but it sounds different from the one spoken in Delhi and Mumbai. A different dialect and accent. \n\nYour entire childhood requires only Hindi or a different dialect of it along or not with your mother tongue. But almost everyone speaks Hindi for hundreds of kilometres. \n\nBy the time you are in college or working age, you hear Hindi everywhere. You do hear some other languages but those are usually rare. Everyone knows it exists but not many know who speaks it or what they are saying.\n\nNow you are mixing with other states for college or work. One speaks Malayalam and one Tamil. You do understand some of what they are saying but not all. Its your office and you need to communicate, so you decide on the one language that is a neutral one, one that has stood the test to time for you, Hindi.   \nYour colleagues are confused and respond in kind with passable Hindi but you are back at square one with poor communication. You realize they speak in English and you know English too but you have never used it much apart from in exams and such. \n\nYou try to continue to speak in Hindi with English words but all they see is you speak Hindi and after a few weeks start to become a little less engaged with you. \n\nAlso you can't make out which language they are speaking. You won't be able to tell the difference between Tamil, Telugu, Tulu, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya etc for a good many years. Most south Indians even if they can't speak the language will be able to recognize it and shift to an alternative language, usually English. This leaves you isolated in the beginning. \n\nYou start to find other Hindi speaking people and get into closed groups with them, interacting mostly with them. Since most companies are global or national companies some boss would be based in Mumbai or Delhi and Hindi speaking. You are able to better communicate with them despite being new to the office and thus again feel some heat for stifling other colleagues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HINDI**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHindi is spoken in Southern India. You know it. It just confuses you as to why can't every one speak it and why is it not all the time. \n\nIn North people always greet each other in Hindi and then based on the nuances of your speech recognize you as a fellow Gujurati or Punjabi and shift to local language. \n\nThis new phenomenon of not being able to understand the local language or even other state languages is really confusing. \n\nMost north Indians realize they will have to learn more than one language to survive here and they just give up. You learn Kannada and now you meet people who speak only Tamil or Telugu and again you are back to square one. You drive your car 5 hours in any direction and you need to learn a new language. \n\nIt is highly stressful for individuals from North who have already learnt a second base language, Hindi for this exact reason, but it is not useful here anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoint to note : Not everyone who speaks Hindi is a native Hindi speaker. Most south Indians don't even ask a Hindi speaking person, what their own mother tongue is.\n\nAlso the Hindi we hear is a very different form of Hindi, that is more polished and commercial you can say. Hindi itself has so many dialects that you wouldn't understand it even if you learnt Hindi. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people form all parts of India now speak good English, so this is not as big an issue now, as it was 10 or 20 years ago.\n\nAlso now the number of migrants has gone significantly up and thus you no longer need to speak in any other language other than Hindi anymore especially in Bengaluru. \n\nI have noticed, my watchman, dhobi, swiggy/zomato guy, waiter, salesperson etc, all touch points outside, everyone speaks Hindi well or in some form. \n\nThus the incentive to learn the local language has gone down even more. This is the truth and the organic way of most cities. The people choose the language not the other way round. \n\nI am not saying Bangalore will become a Hindi speaking city. There will always be a metropolitan mix of cultures here, but Hindi has started to find its place in between English, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu here. Sorry if I missed any locally spoken languages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will be good for people from North to partake in a little more of our Indian culture and speak another ancient language like Tamil if they are in Chennai, Kannada if in Bengaluru etc but it can't be done by force. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nAll in all , every Indian language needs to be respected and it is futile to fight over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJai Hind"<br />Author: 'Maddoc_71'  id: 'ufxkqd'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ufxkqd/hindi_usage_in_south_of_india_part_2_northern/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A reminder that thousands of women are molested and sexually harassed during the Hajj pilgrimage to the Mecca every year - many of them underage girls and nothing is done about it despite Mecca being the holiest place for Muslims in the world'<br />Body: 'She was just 21 years old and wanted to touch the kabah – understandably, but she was corralled by molesters and she could not move out of the circle. Someone touched her buttocks and even after she was alarmed, someone grabbed her breasts. \n\nFor people who do not know, the Hajj pilgrimage is prescribed to every Muslim who can monetarily afford it, at least once in his/her lifetime. Over 40% of Hajj’s pilgrims consist of women every year. Devout Muslims perform the tawaf, where they walk counter-clockwise around the Kaaba – the holiest site for Muslims in the world. \n\nThis makes the ritual of the tawaf the holiest ritual in Islam.\n\nAnd in this holiest ritual is where thousands of devout Muslim women and underage girls have been a subject of molestation and sexual harassment – in the holiest place for Muslims in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# In 2018, hundreds of Muslim women around the world came out during the MeToo movement and spoke about their stories of sexual harassment and molestation they faced while doing the tawaf –\n\nThese stories are nothing but absolutely horrifying because many of the accounts are from women who were molested when they were less than 16 years of age. Some women recall being molested when they were just 12 years old.\n\n**The problem is so rife that female pilgrims are warned before they reach Mecca that they might get molested and groped while performing the tawaf.** They are asked to stand beside their relatives and not go into the crowded places during the tawaf.\n\nHere are some accounts. I have to give a trigger warning here. Please do not read if you are sensitive to such incidents –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A woman was persistently molested during the tawaf THRICE in a day and eventually had to leave because of the molestation –\n\nWhile performing the tawaf, she was grabbed by her waist which she ignored because she was in shock. \n\nThe second time she felt something poking her butt from behind.\n\nThe third time, someone grabbed and pinched her butt, but the crowd around her was too thick and she could not move.\n\nShe posted this on Facebook, but then deleted her account citing pressure from radical elements.\n\nShe has no intention of going back to Mecca again because she is in shock that people would behave like this in the holiest place for Muslims in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A Pakistani woman was molested in every way possible when she was performing the tawaf in the circle closest to the kabah – the circle where any pilgrim can touch the holiest structure –\n\nShe was just 21 years old and wanted to touch the kabah – understandably, but she was corralled by molestors and she could not move out of the circle. Someone touched her buttocks and even after she was alarmed, someone grabbed her breasts. \n\nThe shocking thing is that when she turned to see who was doing it, the man who had molested her was smiling at her and the rest of the men told her to hurry up and move on while molesting her.\n\nShe was helpless and could do nothing.\n\nShe never went back to the Hajj.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A woman was just 15 when she was groped by the crowd while performing the tawaf. The molestor did not remover “his hand from her ass” even when she squirmed in agony –\n\nHer ordeal did not end until she moved away from the circle performing the tawaf. She was essentially molested the entire time she performed the holiest rite in Islam.\n\nNot just this, the most shocking part she writes is that she was even molested by a policeman who stands at guard near the kabah. The same policeman who is supposed to protect the pilgrims grabbed her breast and molested the woman.\n\nShe was molested and assaulted both the times she visited Mecca, and has never been there after that. \n\nBoth the times she was underage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A 17 year old girl from Indonesia was poked by a man with his penis while doing the tawaf around the Kabah –\n\nShe was also catcalled and harassed in the hotel lobby she was living in during the pilgrimage.\n\nWhen she complained, she was asked –\n\n***"Why you are not using a black abaya?"***\n\nShe has not been back for the Hajj pilgrimage after that incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A Pakistani woman who was just 10 years old was molested twice in a single pilgrimage to Mecca –\n\nThe first time it happened during the tawaf – no surprise there. She was groped aggressively but somehow she managed to move ahead and walk with her mother.\n\nThe next time when she was in the bus in the holy city, she was molested by the bus conductor where he grabbed her thigh for a long time – while pretending to fix her seat.\n\nLike most of the victims, even she expresses surprise that people whould behave like this in the holiest place for Muslims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A woman recalls being molested and harassed twice – when she was just 13 and once when she was 17 during her Hajj pilgrimage –\n\nThe first time it happened when a man leeched on her during the Umrah. **She was just 13 then.** He beckoned her over in the presence of her mother and sister.\n\nThe second time someone grabbed her breasts during the stoning ritual, east of Mecca. She looked to see that the man grabbing her breasts stood with his wife beside him. Her mother nor the molestor’s wife minded this disgusting act in the holiest city in the world for Muslims.\n\nShe also has no intentions to go back to Mecca again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are thousands of such accounts of being groped, molested and harassed by women and underage girls during their pilgrimage to the Mecca.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Even today, you can find thousands of tweets relating to molestation in mosques under the hashtag #MosqueMeToo on twitter.**\n\nI would urge people to go and read some of the tweets over there to get a handle on how women are subjected to such degradation in Mecca of all places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Some tweets I will note here to give you an idea of what goes on in Mecca during the Tawaf –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;young guy touched my body just next to Al-Masjid Al-Nabawi in Medina, Saudi Arabia.

      <li>Title::: 'Have Hindus lost our power &amp; become extremely weak as a race?'<br />Body: 'Are we broken (psychologically) and in need of healing?\n\nI am Hindu and I love Sanatan Dharma and Bharat. I know when Hindus go abroad we do extremely well as we can see in the US and Western countries.. This is because we work hard. And focus on excelling and making money. And we have great family values.\n\nBut what I am referring to when I say "weak" is\n\n1. Millions of people in Bharat still have a colonized mindset. Do you know that caged birds sometimes refuse to fly out even if the cage door is open. This is because they have developed certain habits of thinking. Or certain comfort zones.\n2. Are you aware that one of the biggest holocausts in the world happened here in Bharat? Millions and millions of us were butchered and our entire cultures, knowledge and libraries were wiped out. These experiences are still deeply ingrained in us. And millions were enslaved and taken over the Hindu Kush mountains to be sold in the markets of the middle east. Do you know that Hindu Kush means Hindu killer, because many died on the way.\n3. Since independence, the leftists have made sure that we don\'t know who we are. Because they have wrangled our history. And kept our true history hidden from us.\n4. I know that it\'s very important to work hard and make money. Money is important to make sure our families have a good life. But the problem is that Hindus have many blind spots. Because if there are large numbers of people who live within our borders who want our destruction, who want civil unrest and civil war, what are we going to do about it?\n\nI believe that Hindus need to develop mental strength and fortitude. And a greater awareness of what is happening. I have created a subreddit where we are going to talk about these things. I have very powerful methods I want to teach people totally for free. I don\'t charge. I just want everyone to learn these things because its very essential. It will create enormous benefit in all areas of your life and create a stronger society.\n\nA couple days ago, I wrote a post in the IndiaSpeaks sub. I would like everyone to read it. Many people are liking it. Just go to my profile and search for "Do You Love Bharat, India and Sanatani ...". It\'s in this IndiaSpeaks sub.

      <li>Title::: 'This is what happens when you try to raise your voice.'<br />Body: '*Mods please don\'t remove this post. I need to get my voice heard for the sake of myself and rest of the Indian community.*\n\n**Quick Backstory:** I got frustrated seeing huge surge in racist comments on any post regarding to India. So yesterday, I decided to vent it out on r//TrueOffMyChest using a throwaway account. The post initially got OK attention followed by racists comments specifically which I didn\'t mind since it further consolidated my point.\n\nIt wasn\'t even a day when the moderators of that sub removed my post for no reason. They gave me no warning or messages. Nothing. You might wonder why the post then got removed? Yes, they silenced/oppress everyone who speaks out against oppression particularly against White. I wasn\'t surprised since I was expecting that they would do mass downvoting or something like that. But never in my life had I thought they would outright remove the post for no reason. If this isn\'t suppression then what is it?\n\nNow, I\'m not saying to personally attack the mods of that subs or vote brigade or anything like that. Even I despise that. I just want everyone to be acknowledged of the drama that just happened, it\'s shocking how blatant the racism is out here on this very website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Original thread:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Reddit is particularly rac!st when it comes to Indians. Just go to any thread about something even slightly negative regarding to India on Reddit. It\'s OK to call all of us street shitters and rapists and hoping we die but if anyone says 1% of that about any other race, they\'d be outright slap banned from that subreddit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Like I still remember that one AITA thread where some white girl asked if she was the asshole for saying she\'d never date an Indian guy. As you would expect, all the top comments were "NTA All Indian men are rapists" or something along the lines of that. It had thousands of upvotes and mods did nothing about it. They\'d never say anything so generalizing about any other race though.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why is it that whenever there\'s any post about India you immediately have absolute degenerates in the comments saying shit like scammers, shitting streets, rape, trash can of world, etc. That is literally the definition of racism. Looking at only the negatives of any society or country and stereotyping the entire country the same way. A large fraction of Westerners harbor feelings of racism against Indians. Reddit gives them an anonymous and safe environment to express their racism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why is it that no one comments about Yoga? One of the greatest forms of exercise ever invented is that it combines mind, body &amp; spirit and has the power to change lives. No one comments about India\'s booming IT hub. Literally one of the biggest sectors in the world. No one comments about India\'s arts. We have incredibly beautiful, complex and layered musical styles like classical music, folk music, Carnatic, and Sufi music to name just a few.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;India is where musical instruments like the Sitar, Tabla, and Santoor originated from, to just name a few. The heavenly sounds emanating from these instruments are truly magical. Even western artists like the Beatles and Bob Dylan were heavily influenced by Indian music.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But no, these neckbeard Redditors don\'t have the mental capacity to even consider that a country of 1.3 billion people, hundreds of languages, and a civilizational existence since thousands of years could be anything more than the stereotypes, they spout to sound edgy. It is a pathetic, narrow-minded and maliciously ignorant mindset to have.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They do it because they know we won\'t retaliate. If they try that shit against an Afr!can-Amer!can they know B1M would fuck them up and they\'d lose their jobs, so they have to pick on people who won\'t retaliate. It\'s really fucking pathetic. Racism against Indians is not only tolerated but also encouraged. An easy metric is: Ask such people to replace Indians with "b!ack people" and "Lat!n-Amer!cans" and see if they\'d be comfortable saying the same things about them. Indians are really at the bottom of the pecking order when it comes to racism. 100% sure that these comments would not be removed from the forum because in the eyes of those "it\'s just valid criticism" and not "racism".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;World news sub has been littered with anti-Indian racism for the past few weeks. TBF, anti-Indian racism is always rampant there but it has recently reached an overdrive because of Russ!a-Ukra!ne war and India\'s stance on it. There were comments that upvoted by thousands on that sub calling for Indian immigrants to be deported from America and making fun of Indian accent and calling Indians savages and animals. But according to the mods of r//worldnews these comments don\'t exist apparently. Reddit on the whole is controlled by white supremac!sts and if you even try to counter anti-Indian racism, you will be silenced by the same.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The sad thing is that a lot of Indians especially younger teenagers start to develop an inferiority complex due to this blatant racism and start self-loathing to White validation. And when these people agree with other rac!sts on the internet, they get bombed with upvotes and people start believing that Indians are really absolute crap. This mindset is a direct result of over 300 years of colonization, and the blatant racism on the internet. If you call out to someone they\'ll just say "It\'s a joke bro, chill". Sometimes I see posts from people who try to hide that they are Indian because of this and heck even I feared sometimes to reveal my identity online because of sudden change in behavior towards me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Call me whatever you want, blame me for sweeping over-generalizing or looking into wrong places. Come with thousands of isolated examples to defend your views that "We are the most welcoming people". Or still continue to be rac!st against me. I don\'t care. I just simply don\'t care. I had seen enough of it. Time to leave this site already. I\'m pretty sure this post will also be silenced since it has now become the norm to suppress such uprisings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Edit: I\'m loving the fact that some of ya consistently proving my point by making racist comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal thread at: [Link](https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/uer13j/im_tired_of_casual_racism_particularly_against/)\n\nScreenshot of comments: [Link](https://imgur.com/a/nUqRbdx)\n\nThere were literally racist comments but they didn\'t remove that instead they removed my post.

      <li>Title::: 'Communal relations between Hindus and Muslims in Medieval India.'<br />Body: 'The most outstanding fact in the social and religious life of the age is the impact of Islam. The followers of that faith settled in India in large numbers, but, generally speaking, kept themselves severely aloof from the normal current of the social and religious life of the country. Many times, since the advent of the Aryans, more than three thousand years ago, diverse types of culture met in India, but with the exception of a very small Parsi enclave, were all fused together in a common cultural pattern. The Muslims, however, did not merge themselves into this pattern, and form with the Hindus a single type of homogeneous culture. So, for the first time in Indian history, two distinct but important communities and cultures stood face to face, and India was permanently divided into two powerful units, each with marked individuality of its own, which did not prove to be amenable to a fusion or even any close permanent co-ordination. The problem which then faced India has proved to be the most knotty one in its chequered history during the next six hundred years, and has not entirely been solved by the partition or bifurcation of India. The genesis of the problem has therefore been dealt with in some detail in Chapter XVII-C. It is a delicate and difficult task, but could not be avoided in a history whose avowed object is to give a real picture of the history and culture of the Indian people. Islam touched Hindu life, and was itself touched by Hinduism, at many points. The reaction produced by the one upon the other is not always easy to determine, and the task has been rendered more difficult by passions and prejudices, and pressure of extraneous considerations. \n\nPolitical necessities of the Indians during the last phase of British rule underlined the importance of alliance between the two communities, and this was sought to be smoothly brought about by glossing over the differences and creating an imaginary history of the past in order to depict the relations between the two in a much more favourable light than it actually was. Eminent Hindu political leaders even went so far as to proclaim that the Hindus were not at all a subject race during the Muslim rule. These absurd notions, which would have been laughed at by Indian leaders at the beginning of the nineteenth century, passed current as history owing to the exigencies of the political complications at the end of that century. Unfortunately slogans and beliefs die hard, and even today, for more or less the same reasons as before, many Indians, specially Hindus, are peculiarly sensitive to any comments or observations even made in course of historical writings, touching upon the communal relations in any way. A fear of wounding the susceptibilities of the sister community haunts the minds of Hindu politicians and historians, and not only prevents them from speaking out the truth, but also brings down their wrath upon those who have the courage to do so. But history is no respecter of persons or communities, and must always strive to tell the truth, so far as it can be deduced from reliable evidence. This great academic principle has a bearing upon actual life, for ignorance seldom proves to be a real bliss either to an individual or to a nation. In the particular case under consideration, ignorance of the actual relation between the Hindus and the Muslims throughout the course of history,—an ignorance deliberately encouraged by some,—may ultimately be found to have been the most important single factor which led to the partition of India. The real and effective means of solving a problem is to know and understand the facts that gave rise to it, and not to ignore them by hiding the head, ostrich-like, into sands of fiction. \n\nIt is thus quite clear that both from purely academic and practical standpoints, the plain duty of a historian of India is to reveal the truth about the communal relations in the past, without being influenced in any way by any extraneous factor. This conclusion is fortified by other considerations. It is now a well-known fact that a few powerful dictators who dominated Europe in the recent past emphasized the need of re-writing the history of their countries to suit their political actions and ideals. This is undoubted^ a great tribute paid to history for its formative influence upon mankind, but cuts at the very root of all that makes history an intellectual discipline of the highest value. There are ominous signs that the same idea is slowly invading democratic countries also, not excluding India. This world tendency to make history the vehicle of certain definite political, social and economic ideas, which reign supreme in each country for the time being, is like a cloud, at present no bigger than a man’s hand, but which may soon grow in volume, and overcast the sky, covering the light of the world by an impenetrable gloom. The question is therefore of paramount importance, and it is the bounden duty of every historian to guard himself against the tendency, and fight it by the only weapon available to him, namely by holding fast to truth in all his writings irrespective of all consequences. A historian should not trim his sail according to the prevailing wind, but ever go straight, keeping in view the only goal of his voyage—the discovery of truth. \nThese elaborate observations are specially intended to explain the editorial policy of the present series. The first five volumes, dealing with the history of the ancient Hindus, were, comparatively speaking, free from what would be regarded as serious controversial issues at the present day. The present volume, dealing with the beginnings of the Muslim settlement in India on a permanent basis, naturally has to deal with topics which have a direct or indirect bearing on many live issues of today. The number of such issues would go on increasing with each succeeding volume, and volumes IX and X, which deal with the British rule in India, will be full of them, evoking strong sympathies and antipathies which are likely to blur the clear vision of both writers and readers of Indian history. It would be the endeavour of the present editor to follow the three fundamental principles enunciated above: firstly, that history is no respecter of persons or communities; secondly, that its sole aim is to find out the truth by following the canons commonly accepted as sound by all historians; and thirdly, to express the truth, without fear, envy, malice, passion, or prejudice, and irrespective of all extraneous considerations, both political and humane. In judging any remark or opinion expressed in such a history, the question to be asked is not whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, mild or strong, impolitic or imprudent, but simply whether it is true or false, just or \nunjust, and above all, whether it is or is not supported by the evidence at our disposal. \n\nThis editorial policy is responsible for clearly bringing out in detail those points of difference which stood as barriers between the Hindus and Muslims and served to keep them effectively as two separate units in their common motherland. These are primarily the religious bigotry on the side of the Muslims and social bigotry on the part of the Hindus. These differences are generally sought to be explained away or minimised, and even eminent scholars demur to pointed references to the oppressive acts of bigoted Muslim rulers like Firuz Tughluq and Sikandar Lodi even though proved by the unimpeachable testimony of their own confessions. Such an attitude may be due to praiseworthy motives, but is entirely out of place in historical writings. \nThe same attitude is far more strikingly illustrated in another sphere. The end of Hindu ruling dynasties, followed by almost wholesale destruction of temples and monasteries by the Muslim invaders and rulers, very nearly extinguished the Hindu culture by destroying the sources which fed and nourished it. Its further growth was arrested and an almost impenetrable gloom settled over it. It seemed as if the whole course of its development came to a sudden halt. It is not a mere accident that the lamp of the past glory and culture of Brahmanical Hinduism was kept burning only in the Hindu principalities—particularly the tiny State of Mithila in the north and the kingdom of Vijayanagara in the south. Modern Hindu India is indebted to these Hindu kingdoms for having preserved the continuity of Brahmanical culture and traditions, from the Vedic age downwards, which was in imminent danger of being altogether snapped. For it is impossible to deny that India was saved from this irretrievable disaster by the patronage of the rulers of Vijayanagara and Mithila. While the Brahmanical culture was submerged under the sea of Islam from one end of India to the other, it found its last refuge in the two islands at the northern and southern extremities. This plain truth is not fully realized by many historians. \n\nThe patronage of literature in spoken languages by a few Muslim rulers is the only redeeming feature in the general Muslim attitude to the Hindu culture. But its nature has been misunderstood and its effect much exaggerated. The Muslim hatred to the Brahmans, to which Ihn Batutah bears eloquent testimony, made the Muslim rulers more favourablv inclined to such literature which was looked upon by the Brahmans as a mortal blow to their power and prestige, and hence strongly disliked by them as a class. The period of Husain Shah and his son in Bengal is usually held out as one of \nthe most glowing examples of the Muslim patronage of Hindu culture. The high development of literature and philosophy of the Chaitanya school of Vaishnavism during the period under review is regarded as a sign of Hindu revival during the Medieval Age. It is, however, to be remembered that out of hundreds of Muslim rulers and officers in Bengal only three—Husain Shah, his son Nusrat Shah and his general Paragal Khan—are known to have patronized Bengali poets whose obsequious flattery to their Muslim patrons is disgusting to modern taste. As regards Chaitanya and his followers, their persecution in the hands of the officers of Husain Shah, the most enlightened and liberal Muslim Sultan, has been described in some detail on pp. 632-635. One significant feature of the Chaitanya movement is often ignored. Of the twenty-four years he remained in his mortal frame after he renounced the world and was initiated as a scinyasin, he hardly spent even a year in the dominion of Husain Shah and his Muslim successors, but lived for twenty years in the Hindu kingdom of Orissa. The Vaishnava followers of Chaitanya were persecuted in their homeland during the regime of Husain Shah, and Chaitanya spent practically his whole life as a sanydsin under the patronage of the Hindu ruler of Orissa who became his devoted disciple. By connecting these two facts it will not probably be wrong to surmise that though Chaitanya began his religious life in the Muslim kingdom of Bengal, it did not evidently prove a congenial home to him or to his cult, and both found a safe refuge only in the neighbouring Hindu kingdom. In any case the fact remains that the chief credit for the rise and growth of Chaitanya’s Vaishnavism must go to the Hindu kingdom of Orissa and not to the Muslim kingdom of Bengal. This is a very significant fact in the history of Hindu culture in India during the period under review. It may also be noted in this connection that Hindu art practically went out of existence in Muslim States, though in a few places like Gujarat, its influence may be traced in Muslim architecture. After the thirteenth century, notable specimens of Hindu art are to be found only in the Hindu States of Vijayanagara and Mewar. Hindu culture did not flourish under Islam, and the few facts brought forward to prove the contrary may at best be likened to a few tiny oases which merely serve to bring into greater relief the barren desolation of the long stretch of arid desert. \nIn the face of all these difficult and delicate problems the task of maintaining the correct standard in a co-operative historical work, is not an easy one. As originally planned, the different chapters in this volume were to be written by different scholars who have specialised on the particular topics. But even the best efforts of the editor failed to secure a reasonable degree of objective and impartial treatment in certain chapters.\n\n-Vol. 6: The Delhi Sultanate, R.

India has always been the land of a vibrant culture. Languages and dialects, irrespective of their family of origin have added more colour to it and we must celebrate that. \n\nLanguage was meant for communication, to bridge the gap between humans, to interact but today the war of language supremacy across the country is creating more divide than bridging the gap. Yes Hindi is more often than not the bridge between pan India speakers but it does not mean we can or should try and post it as the language of the people of India. If Mahatma Gandhi himself was opposed a century ago when he proposed the idea of Hindi being promoted to national language status then there must be no debates today as to why we must debate it again and again.\n\nBeing a proud Hindi speaker it brings me more joy when others feel proud of their heritage too. Hindi can be the unofficial bridge to the people of India but should never be the only bridge amongst the speakers of this country.

      <li>Title::: "I admit this is a whatsapp forward, excluding tge specific examples, can the more learned here shed light on these fixers? Is it simply money in the end? We're shafted huh..."<br />Body: "A few months ago, there was a program on a TV channel featuring former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, who was then a Rajya Sabha MP, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and many others.\n\nWhen the anchor questioned former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi about the Indian judiciary, former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that although I wanted to, I could not reform the Indian judiciary because our judicial system is under the control of some big brokers (fixers). And these big fixers run their justice system the way they want it to.\n\nAt the event, Justice Ranjan Gogoi raised even bigger questions on the judiciary, such as, if India wants to build a 5 trillion economy, it cannot have a 5 trillion economy unless India changes the justice system because India's judiciary is so fragile and crumbling. It is weakening not only the country but also the economy and the fabric of this country.\n\nHe further said that India's justice system can never do justice to the middle class or the poor and it is a bitter truth that if you are a billionaire with a lot of money then you will get justice and your lawyers will tell the judges what to do. Lawyers decide what you want to decide Some of the country's top lawyers have become the biggest fixers in the Supreme Court today.\n\nJustice Ranjan Gogoi's statement has not been acted upon by the Supreme Court as every Supreme Court judge knows that he is in the clutches of big fixers like Dushyant Dave, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Prashant Bhushan and these people run the Supreme Court of India as they please.\n\nHow bitter Justice Ranjan Gogoi was, I think it would have been better if he had given some examples and some names.\n\nThere are two cases, both are very similar\n\nBJP leader Kirit Somaiya was accused by the Maharashtra government of accepting donations from the people to save INS Virat and did not give any account of those donations to the government. He applied for pre-arrest bail in three courts, but all three courts did not grant him pre-arrest bail.\n\nNow look at another example, Teesta Javed Sitalwad, who was baking bread during the Gujarat riots, received donations of around Rs 100 crore from various countries including Gulf countries, US and UK. She used the trust's money to buy gold jewelry at Dubai airport or duty-free liquor at the UK airport, while another trustee of the same trust, Sabrang, lodged a complaint with the police.\n\nThe police initially investigated for 6 months, collected all the evidence, after which the police went to Mumbai to arrest Teesta Javed.\n\nTeesta Javed did not open the door of his house for 10 minutes, a police station in the area received a Supreme Court decision in the mail that Teesta had been ordered to stop his arrest.\n\n It is learned that Kapil Sibal passed the order over the phone to a Supreme Court judge, meaning it was the first time in India's history that the Supreme Court had ordered a telephone hearing and ordered a telephone hearing in just 3 minutes.\n\nExactly the same happened in the case of Rana Ayub, who also did not audit the donations collected in the name of Gujarat riots and made a term deposit of Rs 5 crore in the name of his father. While she was going abroad, there was all the evidence against her and while stopping her from going abroad, the Mumbai High Court said that the amount of Rs 5 crore was not such a big amount that it should be considered as a big fraud.\n\nI remember when a bus conductor had to fight for 40 years because he did not pay 20 paise, then our court system did not say that 20 paise is not a big amount.\n\nNow look at the example of yesterday's Jahangirpuri.\n\nAfter the bulldozer reached Jahangirpuri at 10.30 am, Ulema's lawyers Kapil Sibal, Dushyant Dave and Prashant Bhushan went straight to the Supreme Court at 10.31 am and at 10:45 am the Supreme Court granted stay.\nI was surprised. How could such a case be heard and ordered so quickly when the judiciary of India, i.e. the lower court, the high court and even the apex court were not taken into consideration?\n\nIn other words, Justice Ranjan Gogoi rightly said that the Indian judiciary is in the hands of every court fixer in India.\n\n- Jaisingh Mohan"<br />Author: 'Turbulent_Ad_862'  id: 'uep2h1'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uep2h1/i_admit_this_is_a_whatsapp_forward_excluding_tge/</li>

The worst is yet to come."<br />Body: '**Climate Change**\n\nThe severe heat waves are expected to stretch into early next month, meaning millions of people will have to endure more days of dangerous temperatures and hours-long blackouts.\n\n“Why is it exceptionally warm this year? The only reason is global warming," said Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “We have looked at data for seventy years and at the intensity, the number of heatwaves is directly in response to global warming."\n\nIndia is expected to suffer more frequent and intense heat waves, extreme rainfall and erratic monsoons in the coming decades as the planet warms, according to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. McKinsey estimates that work hours lost to heat waves could cause losses of as much as $250 billion, or 4.5% of gross domestic product, by the end of the decade.\n\nThe disasters underscore how countries like India, which are responsible for relatively little of the greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere, often bear the brunt of climate impacts. That means spending billions to protect themselves instead of investing in economic development that could lift millions out of poverty.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the meteorological department issued an orange alert for the next five days for northwest and central India. The region, home to some of the world’s most polluted air, hasn’t received the light summer rain that usually comes in April and May to lower temperatures and wash away dirty particulate matter.“IPCC projections clearly show that the heat intensity is increasing and encroaching on our daily lives, and the impact is on vulnerable people who have little resources in regions where we don’t even have observations," said Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “We need higher resolution data and, more importantly, we need long-term policies."

A landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in February that with just 1.5C of warming, temperatures could expect an annual repeat of the 2015 heatwave, in which temperatures hit 44C and thousands of people died.This March was the hottest in over 100 years of record-taking in India, and April has been similar.

Wheat is very sensitive to heat, especially during the final stage when its kernels mature and ripen. Indian farmers time their planting so that this stage coincides with India\'s usually cooler spring.\n\nIn Punjab, government assessments predict lower yields for wheat and rice this year. Devinder Sharma, an agriculture policy expert in northern Chandigarh city said he expected to get 25% less. The story is the same in other major wheat-producing states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe government must maintains a tricky balance between demand and supply. It needs about 25 million tons (27.5 million U.S. tons) of wheat for the vast food welfare program that usually feeds more than 80 million people.

If I remember the concept right, such a sample from a large population is called representative sample if it can show the properties of the entire population. For example, if we have a "representative sample" of 100 people, then instead of taking a survey covering 100k people, you could just survey this 100 and get very good idea of what the entire population thinks. This precisely is the reason why I think this video is very important. IMO, this momina is a representative sample i.e. if you see their behavior on streets and try to guess what are the conditions in their homes are like, this is the answer.\n\nI\'ve downloaded a copy of this video.\n\nShe i.e. momina taunts Praveen for interacting with non-mehram men on internet showing face, neck and hair. And then she also mentions that they\'ve ruled India for hundreds of years, made Hindus eat dust and then asserts that they\'ll raise again.\n\n[Why are you wearing Tee Shirt](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=565)? Don\'t you know how wrong it is? You are enticing men. You are attracting men with your \'adaye\'. Your behavior is not in tune with your age.\n\nShe i.e. momina talks about [religious education](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=699) in Rampur madarsa. When asked if her sole education is only religious or did she attend any school, the reply comes with spit \'thu, thu thu, thu\' because it\'s shameful to study in a school. And then she says that \'you\' people have encroached on our privilege of ruling the state and threw us out. We\'ll have to take it all and in complete. And then, we\'ll take revenge on \'treatment\' you are meting to us.\n\nShe [talks about her childhood](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=837) life. She learnt making rotis at the age of 5. And was taught all Kitchen and religious activities which she follows to the T regularly to this day. Her nikah was decided when she was 14 and marriage at 16. She hails patience of her husband for waiting 2 years for her before consummating the marriage. And then the conversation drifts and she tells that she finds no use in regular schooling  when you are born to serve Allah and serve religion. And she\'d participate in war, jang-e-jihad.\n\nShe talks about[ role of women](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1004). By grace of God she has 14 children until now. The youngest one is 6 months old and they are twins by grace of god. She heaps praises on her eldest son because he can throw stones very far and also make gulel (catapult/slingshot). And when asked why do you [need to throw stones](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1063), she responds back with answer \'to break your heads\'.\n\nHow many women[ did her husband marry](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1130)? Her husband married 6. And she is the eldest, apparently, being first wife is an honor. She and her cousin are married to him. The next two are Hindu women and the next two are Christian women. She heaps praises on her husband that he is able to manage the large family, and even with little difficulties they are able to live together well. Apparently the Hindu woman has taught her a bit of English.\n\nHer husband didn\'t tell the Christian woman[ that he is already married](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1311) with multiple wives. When she bought the woman home, and she discovered the truth, she didn\'t like it. So this lady, and others try to convince her that its in her best interest to convert because its the best \'deen\'. But the way \'momina\' narrated it, it definitely looks like the christian woman is an captivity and other women are guarding her so that she doesn\'t slip away.\n\n[What are your children doing now?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1414). She tells that they are all being educated in a madarsa.  And then she goes into an epic rant on how muslims are being ill treated everywhere in the world, not just in India. In her words -" in hinduon ne hamara jeena mushkil kar diya". We don\'t have weapons so we\'ll pick up stones.\n\n[What do you think about Kafirs?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=1691).  I don\'t have to write anything here. You will need to listen to few minutes of the video. She says every muslim has a right to convert two or three in his life. The more number of muslims you convert you\'ll get that much of sawab(?), I am assuming bonus points in Jannat. (DO LISTEN TO THIS ~ 5 mins )\n\n[Does your husband beat you?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2087).  One or two slaps or a lash or two by a belt doesn\'t mean that husband has stopped loving you. Worth listening!\n\n[Do you leave home and go anywhere?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2362) . We go out once in an year and her husband books a mini bus for the entire family.\n\n[What do you expect from me?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2394) \n\n[Are you with a half a brain that of a man as mentioned in Quran?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2507) \n\nOur prophet has [waited until Aisha turned 9](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2736), and she says it with pride\n\n[On Hijab](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2826)\n\n[Do you have any daughters?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2841) \n\n[Her views on Hindu/Kafir women]( https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=2892)\n\n[Are you going to get your daughter married off at young age?](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=3207) \n\nI am going to marry the daughter [if she gets to be the first wife of the husband](https://youtu.be/Brvue4G8SXI?t=3325  ) because the second one will be a cousin and third and fourth ones will be a kafir who will do hosehold chores'<br />Author: 'blackrock-orange'  id: 'ueiu2i'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ueiu2i/praveen_pooja_upadhyaya_an_exmuslim_invites_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Institutional Conversion at an all time high?'<br />Body: "To my misfortune, I go to a christian missionary school in Assam. Here's something that happened recently: It was P.E. period, and the students were just messing around in the playground and there wasn't any physical training or anything going on. So, I thought, instead of wasting time, I should probably try reading the Gita I carry around. While I was reading it quietly, some sister suddenly came around and reprimanded me for doing so. She said, 'There's no Gita period, why did you bring this to school?' in a very rude and angry tone. This came as a surprise to me because she had nothing to do with the P.E. period, and the P.E. teacher himself did not care much about what I was doing. I would usually not have a problem with such institutional rules, but it strikes me as absolutely hypocritical, when one of the senior teachers was harping about how christianity is the greatest religious practice. He invited me to church and even offered me a bible. Well, there isn't a bible period at school is there? What's more concerning is I've seen people around me convert to this cult. Even my own family members consider it now, because apparently it comes with 'benefits'. It is scary how so many have already made the change but seemingly are not converted. I'm afraid the same thing is happening all around the country, and I don't know what to do."<br />Author: 'EkaSaffronGaruda'  id: 'uei2zb'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uei2zb/institutional_conversion_at_an_all_time_high/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[OC] Padma, Don’t Preach !'<br />Body: 'Since self promo isn’t allowed - I am not including the link to my blog. But I hope you guys enjoy it ! \n\n————— \n\nOn the brink of a move to NYC, My friend Lavanya from South Delhi was looking for advice that would make her American adventure easier. In response, I told her go to any village in nearby Haryana, find out who the Sarpanch is and ask him for some tips.\n\nBewildered, she asked me how his advice‘d be relevant? How a villager would know anything at all about the snazzy NYC lifestyle? In response, I stated that if Padam Lakshmi from NYC can comment on the state of Hindus in India, then why can’t Devendra Gujjar from Hissar comment on the way of life in NYC ?\n\nIn seriousness, there is a section of the urban populace of India that approves of Padma Lakshmi’s remarks that there is absolutely no threat to Hinduism at all. Zilch. Zero. Nada. Instead, she orders us filthy ignorant masses to focus on the violence against muslims in India. If her remarks perplex you then congratulations – you are smarter than most.\n\nComing in the wake of organised violence against Hindus, effected by the muslims of India, her comments fall flatter than a Milanese Fashion model. While the fake news media won’t report on this anti-hindu violence (to preserve national integrity I suppose) there has been plenty of brou-ha raised on social media. Am I to assume, that Padma in her all knowing ‘slay-queen’ self, did not come across any ?\n\nSome people blamed her triggered remarks on a mid-life crisis, for after all Padma has slid from ‘desirable 40 year old’ to ‘Namaste Aunty’ rather quickly and that is bound to have an adverse mental effect. On the other hand, many who are told of these comments ask “Padma who ?” – Yet, there is a minuscule group who are in agreement with Padma aunty and would’ve nodded in agreement, as they double tapped her post and continued down the feed.\n\nPadma aunty has build her career riding the coat talis of Salman Rushdie, a man who had a death warrant issued on his head for ’insulting Islam’. This is a woman who has a first hand experience of the tyrannical nature of Islam and yet, it is her own people, the Hindus, that she chooses to admonish.\n\nSo we can tell Padma not to preach, but preach she will. Because that is her job. You see, Padma is a puppet, propped up by the deep state, the CIA, the Marxists, the Soros Gang – whatever you wanna call the powers that be. And she is not the only one. \n\nFrom Malala, to Greta, to the Ranas &amp; the Fayes . The deep state has its puppets in all spheres and when needed, they (like a sleeper cell) can be activated and made to parrot in favour of whatever narrative the deep state wants to push.\n\nThe nonsensical ”anti-muslim India” faultline is one, that bears fruits of narrative that pay rich dividends and is exploited by everyone from 10 Downing to GHQ Rawalpindi. Padma is towing this very same line.\n\nThis train of mis-thought by Padma aunty, boarded hours later by washed out footballer Mesut Ozil, should leave no doubts in our minds that the Cold War that has been brewing against Modi &amp; by association, the Hindus of India, is about to shift into third gear.\n\nHave no doubts, that from now until 2024, there will be manufactured riots &amp; attacks on Hindu festivals. Once Hindu blood has been shed, the useful idiots will come out of their sinkholes to white-wash the perpetrators. From WaPo Op-eds, to late night shows – all the talk will be about the poor state of muslims in India and the “atrocities” committed by the Hindutva ‘fascists’.\n\nAs the mullahs push the muslim masses into committing violence, the Padmas will preach &amp; blame the victims.

Bereft of an eco-system or any support from the ‘pro-hindu’ government, it is going to take a herculean effort by individual Hindus, online and off it, to even come close to defeating this toxic narrative.\n\nBut these antics are not without hope.

Please Help Make this post go viral!'<br />Body: "Namaskaram,  \n\n\nMost people here may know who Jitendar Narayan Singh Tyagi is.  He had done ghar wapsi to Hinduism - he was previously the chairman of Shia Waqf Board and held a very high post in Shia muslim religion.  His muslim name was Wasim Rizvi. He is currently in jail. Because he has done more for Hinduism, Hindutva and Bharat in current times than I think anyone else I know of, to awaken us all and to warn us about what he feels is coming in Bharat.  And a very powerful lobby of Muslim politicians, the D gang and foreign money want him locked up forever or dead.  His chances of getting out of jail anytime soon are very slim due to this lobby and politicians.  \n\nAfter seeing many videos about him on Youtube, I was feeling very sad because no one was doing anything for him.  I wanted to do something.  I was thinking of a way to spread his story, to educate many people about who this amazing person is and what he was trying to do for us.  I was thinking, is there a way for this to go viral so it can reach ??? maybe Vivek Agnihotri, Kangana Renaut, maybe wealthy Indians in other countries who care and want to do something.  \n\nI sincerely believe that a renaissance or Spiritual awakening is happening and is very essential in Bharat. People need to wake up now and get involved (which is happening due to Kashmir Files movie, etc). We have got to wake up the Hindu masses and the national and spiritual consciousness. Because if we don't, I sincerely believe that we are heading towards civil war in this country. And a lot of hardship, misery or suffering for tons of people.\n\nI also wanted to share a few words about myself.  My name is Bobby Luthra. I love Bharat and I thank God that I was born in a Hindu family. I am so, so grateful. I have been Spiritually minded since a young age (although not religious).  I have lived outside of India since a young age, mostly in the US. Now I am in Delhi, taking care of my 92yo mother. I don't know and have never been involved with Jitendra Tyagi or the Hindu saints (Swami Yeti Narasimhanand, and Swami Amritanand) who appear with him in his videos. I have only been watching the videos online.   \nI also know that a major shift in consciousness is happening in humanity in current times.  All these accelerated global events that are happening since 2019 (pandemic, Ukraine war, being on brink of ww3, etc).  Then all these events happening in Bharat such as Shaheen Bagh, Delhi riots, the attacks on Hindu processions in 7 states and I have heard in over 100+ locations.  And so so much more.   What the heck is happening?  I believe this is all part of the Spiritual awakening of humanity.  The awakening is happening and so needed!  I will talk more about this further down below.\n\nI am providing some must see videos about Jitendar Tyagi below.  I believe Mr Tyagi has done everything out of Love, Truth and morality, to awaken all of us to the truth about Islam and Mohammed.  He wrote a book about Mohammed when he was still Wasim Rizvi, by pulling together all the facts about Mohammed from authentic muslim sources such as Hadith, etc.  Then he called all the Muslim religious leaders to debate with him about what was written in the book.  Not one person came forward.  He has never done anything out of malicious intent, only for the sake of truth.  And for true caring and compassion and brotherly Love for everyone in Bharat.  \nI also think that most Hindus and Sanatanis are asleep.  We have little power left.  No one in Bharat knows about Mr. Tyagi or cares to do anything about it.  The Uttarakhand AAIMS doctors have said he is suffering from heart disease and needs to be out of jail because they can’t operate on him in jail.  There is very good chance he may die in jail.  He is still very young, I think in his late 40s.  If no Sanatani comes forward and helps him, I think this will be a great injustice.  And great shame on us!   The 2 Swamis who are trying to help him have almost run out of money.  We need people to step forward and act - and fight for justice!  \n\nI am not involved with Mr Tyagi or any of these people.  But I am a Spiritual person and I felt I had to do something. That is why I started working on a plan and writing this post.  I did this only out of Love for Hinduism and Bharat.  I received a Spiritual plan which I believe is magnificent.  It will change tons of people’s consciousness in a massive way in Bharat.  It’s an enormous vision!  That’s why I urge everyone to read what I have written here totally.  Especially if you are open to Spirituality or are being called to do something.  Do not skip over anything I have written here.  I believe this can reach a lot of people, and cause massive awakening in people.  If you like this, please help this post and message to go viral!  I am creating a blog, FB groups, Reddit groups, Twitter, Youtube channel, Instagram, etc, etc.  I sincerely believe we all need to do something, otherwise Bharat is in trouble.  I went within and asked for a solution, and this is what I received from Spirit!   \n\n\nIf you are not too familiar with Jitendra Narayan Tyagi's story, then please watch these videos below. Please take the time to see them. Then please read below the videos about the powerful vision that I received for Bharat.    \n\n\n**FIRST PLEASE WATCH THESE VIDEOS**\n\nWasim Rizvi becomes Jitendra Tyagi - What made him convert (10 mins)[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGxPwvnLEg)\n\nWasim Rizvi sharing his views on Mohammad and talking about his book to a Muslim anchor named Amber Zaidi. (55 mins) Every person including non-Muslims need to read this book by Wasim Rizvi about the truth about Islam and Mohammed.  Wasim Rizvi wrote this book to awaken all of us in this great land!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCzJ7pk8ls)\n\nHelpless is a wonderful movie made by Wasim Rizvi on Pakistani Hindus (if you like Kashmiri Files movie, you must see this film too! Absolutely Must See!)[ (1.13 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRf7fqhmbT4)  \nManushi India about most recent news about Jitendra Tyagi and how difficult it is to get him out of jail due to the powerful lobby.

These are letters being received by Swamiji from Jitendra Tyagi from jail.  This video touched me so much and this is the reason I was motivated that I had to do something about it.  That is how I started working on this post and my full vision.  (1.12 min)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzJnNc9EED4)  \nThis video is an interview with Swami Yeti Narasinghanand ji. How he sees the situation of Hindus in India &amp; globally.  (55 mins)  This is a must see video of the Swami who was responsible for Jitendra Tyagi’s ghar wapsi.  Every Hindu needs to see this video!  Please take the time - your future depends upon it!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZL9MX8tq04)\n\nI sincerely believe that 99% of the Sanatani or Hindu community are asleep. Because no one pays attention to what is really important that is happening. We have lost our true Power. Because we have lost our innate Spirituality. Spirituality is the essence of Bharat. All the great discoveries of mankind came from Bharat!  Without the number 0, there could be no science, technology, engineering.  Do you know that?  Now I believe this country may go down the drain or be engulfed in civil war. That is why I am writing this and will be involved with this mission and to fully create this vision. To awaken as many people as possible!  Please follow what I am doing and like my post!  \nPlease join my Subreddit - Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0 (link is at bottom of this post)!  I see New Bharat or Bharat 2.0 as Full of Love and Spirit!  Our Power will come from that!  \nI believe All the problems in our world and in Bharat stem from the fact that there is not enough Love in our country and world.  Humanity has forgotten how to live in Love!  Look at everything that is happening - the Pandemic, all the war and destruction.  It has one root cause - not enough Love.  Not enough Love. Can you see that?   \nIn my Subreddit on Bharat 2.0 we will impart simple ways all of us can restore Love or Divine Love back into our lives!  I urge everyone to spend some part of every day focusing on something, anything you really Love!  Something you can work on selflessly from your Heart because you truly Love it!  Soon your life will start flowing with Divine Love!  And our communities and nation also will start flowing with Divine Love like a massive river!  \n\n\n(This is exactly how I started working on this mission to help free Jitendar Tyagi and wake up the masses!  I am also a very busy guy.  I initially hesitated. I felt what can I do?  How can I do anything?  But I felt I need to do this out of my pure selfless Love for Bharat and for Hinduism. This is like the Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Arjun and Krishna happened inside me. And I eventually surrendered to Krishna’s play or Divine Will.) \n\nWe are born out of Love and we are returning back to Love!  Love is who we are!  Love is our true nature!  God is Love!  Have you heard people say my religion is Love!  This is what Bharat and our world is returning back to more and more now.  All the chaos you are seeing currently will soon be gone!  But we’ve got to do our part.  And fill our lives and mind and heart with Love!  We have to do this daily!   Work on something daily selflessly. Please, please do that!   (If you can’t think of anything to work on selflessly from your heart, just spread this post!  This can spread the Love and Light!)  \nI urge you now to do 3 things (please do 1 and if you have more time do 2 and 3 also)  \n1.  Spread my post to others - Everyone, please do this!  This is the only part that I want everyone to do.  Because we need everyone to start waking up now and start understanding what's really going on in Bharat!   #2 and #3 are optional.  Do them if you have the time.\n\nDon't worry if you don't understand anything right now. Just read it a few times and you will start getting it very soon.  \n2.  If you have time, start going through more of what I am writing in my Subreddit “Let’s Create New Bharat - Bharat 2.0”  Just start reading more and seeing the videos.  Then you can learn more.  Here is my Sub:  r/LetsCreateBharat2_0  \n3.  Start learning more of the methods I am teaching.  They are very simple and powerful Spiritual methods.  Like the 4 min meditation.  This meditation is only 4 mins and it has changed my life!  And I know this will change your life also if you learn it!  (This helps in all areas of life - relationships, work, job, money, health.)  \nPlease help the Swamiji’s to help Jitendra Tyagi!  Just see the videos in this post above about how they can be reached!  Please help them in any ways you can!  \nI will soon be having zoom calls weekly also!  And start talking about this type of stuff.   \nI am feeling that currently we in Bharat have 2 choices.  Either we move forwards towards total Love.  Or total chaos and destruction.  It’s our choice!  My mission is to help people understand how we can move forwards towards total Love!  (And joy and happiness and all good things!)  \nIn my Subreddit, we also focus on spreading Sadhguru’s SaveSoil movement!  That is also very essential!  So please spread this post so more and more people join our Subreddit!  \nThank you!  Pranam!  \nBobby  \nr/LetsCreateBharat2_0"<br />Author: 'bluthra'  id: 'udjjgc'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/udjjgc/do_you_love_bharat_india_and_sanatani_and_want_to/</li>

Kindly send an email to the official contact email ID of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt of India [**jspna-moib@gov.in**](mailto:jspna-moib@gov.in) and feel free to use the following template to send the email. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Dear Sir / Madam,   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We wish to bring this issue to your kind attention with regards to a YouTube Channel named “U2Brutus” (Channel link: [https://www.youtube.com/c/U2Brutus](https://www.youtube.com/c/U2Brutus))  which has published a video on 26th April 2022 regarding Chidambaram  Natarajar Temple and its history, in which he spoke about “Lord Nataraj  and Thilai Kali” as its main content for around 11 minutes and 58  seconds . In this video, he presented false information which hurts the  religious belief of Hindus.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;He used inappropriate words about  the Hindu god “Lord Nataraj” and wanted to spread false information  among the public. This channel has recorded many untrue things about  Hindu beliefs. There are many Hindus who follow SAIVAM Samayam. This  video has been recorded with the intention of offending the religious  beliefs of Hindus who live the life of “Lord Shiva’’. This video has  been released with the intention of creating communal violence in the  society. In this video, He commented about Natarajar dance performance  in a filthy language stating why Lord Natarajar is standing in this  position and \xa0has not worn Underwear and wanted to impress "Thilai  Kalli" and also stated that Lord Natarajar as a Womanizer and a male  chauvinist. He stated about the dance performance in an unethical manner  with intention to create ruckus in society in the name of religion. He  stated all this information is quoted in the Book “Hindu Matam Enge  Selkiratu”.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is evident in this video that he used derogatory  words against Hindu gods and has tried to\xa0 hurt the sentiments of  Hindus. This video was made with malicious intent and to malign the  sanctity of Hindu gods. Hindus can no longer tolerate such ‘slanders’  against their god and religion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We immediately urge you to take  necessary action on this matter and to put\xa0 an end to this wrong  interpretations and the misuse of freedom of speech. There are other  videos too in which he gave derogatory comments about Lord Rama and Lord  Shiva\'s Caste.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are enclosing the channel link in this below for your reference.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  on behalf of all the Hindus.

They even tried to persuade the activists to stop their march but the latter paid no heed and broke through the first barricade, prompting the police to use water cannons against them. The protesters later sat on a dharna on the road against the police action.\n  \n\n&lt;div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25%)'&gt;&lt;iframe src='https://rumble.com/embed/v1014uj/?pub=12ag4r' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&gt;“The state government and police are trying to snatch away our democratic right to protest.

Our constitutional right is being snatched.”\n\n&gt;Majumdar said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has killed democracy in West Bengal. “We asked police to arrest or detain us but not resort to lathi-charge. But they did not listen to us. This police action will not help hide the corruption in recruitment of school teachers. Recommendations made by several MLAs in their official letter pads were taken into consideration for appointment of teachers. We have a list of such names,” he said.\n\n&gt;State education minister Bratya Basu said, “Those involved in the Vyapam scam have come here to protest. Fresh recruitments will be held with full transparency. When we are in the process of hiring, what’s the point of a protest like this? If anyone is found guilty they will be punished.”Also, some Congress workers staged a protest outside Raj Bhawan to protest against the arrest of Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani.\n\nSource : https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-cops-use-water-cannons-on-protesting-bjym-workers-7889009/"<br />Author: 'zaccarin'  id: 'ud7h6b'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ud7h6b/west_bengal_cops_use_water_cannons_on_protesting/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is your opinion on crypto currencies and why is our government against this while other nations are promoting them.'<br />Body: 'Lately finance minister and few other Bjp leaders had been against cryptocurrency and they think that these are associated with buying illegal stuff from dark-net, terrorism funding and money laundering.my personal opinion on crypto is it will replace cash in the future, I had read few books on history of money, and few research papers as well, and it is common that money had been replaced from time to time, first it was barter system, then people used wives, monuments and landmarks to trade, then came the metal coins which was later replaced with paper money which we used today, so now let’s go a bit back in time to the medival age where metal coins were used, metal coins were having direct connection and were directly backed by the metal prices, and were used globally, the coins were widely accepted even with international trade, how ever metal was scarce and making coins out of these metals was expensive so paper money was introduced, now imagine you are in those times when this announcement was made, you would think it’s crazy cause paper literally won’t have same value as gold coin which is made out of gold, and notes made out of paper, which were backed by metals, but a common man would think this idea is crazy,and if you ask an economist he would say money is actually piece of paper which is worthless, it’s only worth cause people believe in it and use it, therefore transactions happen. Same thing is observed in cryptos recently, year by year many people are becoming crypto users, now it’s 6 trillion dollar market cap, coming to the point why I believe cryptos will replace normal currencies cause, first the transactions are cheaper and faster comparing to the traditional banking, second cost associated with cryptos are low, third faster international money transfers even comparing to swift method, finally producing currencies require paper,cotton and a lot of ink which are not sustainable and are not eco friendly. And now let’s talk about money laundering, terrorism funding and drugs, I am just going to keep it short a drug dealer and a prostitute only accepts cash and money laundering is majorly done by using traditional banking system, creating shell  companies and few other methods, which is even happening now without cryptos. Does it mean traditional banking should be banned as well?

      <li>Title::: 'Liberal Democracy is just rule by special interest (NGOs, Lobbys etc)'<br />Body: 'Ranting because I have been watching/ reading too much main stream opinion pieces for UPSC PSIR optional prep. Fuck you the Hindu (newspaper).\n\nLets start with the basics. What is liberal democracy? It means people have guaranteed rights, there are limits to powers of government and rule of law. Since it is not practical for people in large countries to rule directly (like Greece in the past), representatives are elected by popular vote and they make decisions on people\'s behalf. Basic Civics/ Political Science.\n\nBut today, lets say you want to change something, you need to create a large consensus with different groups of people and then get them to elect the representatives who will then make laws to reduce taxes. For individuals this is almost impossible to do. Very few people have the time, skill or money/ other resources to pull this off. So you need to form an organization of people and get them to voice in support of your cause - through media especially - and gather support. Where things go bad is when a few people, instead of doing the hard work and generate consensus, try to buy influence through money power, nepotism, influence etc. This leads to elite capture of institutions. \n\nThese "elites" are not actually elite in anything but rather pliant people who will say and do things for money/ influence/ stable job. But that is not enough because in liberal democracy people have freedom of speech and others can oppose you. So to neutralize this, you have two choices: clamp down on free speech - but this is a bad idea as the people might revolt. The other way is by labeling people who disagree with you as X-ist or X-phobe. Once you give the labels, the "other" side is radioactive. Meaning if anyone takes one single viewpoint that does not agree with "The Message ^(TM)" they will be made an outcaste - no one will hire them or give them a platform. By doing this slowly, over a long enough period you can simply create a bunch of "diverse" people saying the same exact bullshit. Sometimes they do allow a little bit of opposing view when people complain but once things quiet down, they start clamping down again hard.\n\nThis is why you see English language media (both Indian and Foreign) publish crap that simply do not match reality - like the strike in which 250 Million people participated. Why? Because their viewership/ readership numbers are so low and the only way for them to survive is by playing a good doggie to these Lobbys who have lots of money. Their audience is not you. It is their masters who pay them. This is also the reason why there are Gender Neutral toilets in elite colleges in India before we have 100% toilet in every home. The issues close to elites jump the queue.\n\nAnything that supports their cause is done through "wide consensus of diverse groups" while anything that opposes it but has large support is "majoritarian or populist". This is also why when NGOs are not able to freely ply their trade, the "Liberal Democracy Index" shows that you are way down. And that is a good thing. I wish I can write this in the UPSC mains exam but I can\'t. \n\nEnd Rant.'<br />Author: 'ragavsn01'  id: 'ucetgg'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ucetgg/liberal_democracy_is_just_rule_by_special/</li>

If you do a survey of Mumbai, you will find tea, breakfast, omelette, water etc. on all the beaches and streets of Mumbai city, all belong to the Muslim community, and all of them are either from other states or Bangladesh or Rohingya. Even the cocoanuts sold on the side of the road or the vegetable carts, gradually these have been occupied by the Muslim community. The vast majority of businesses in Manish Market, Crawford Market, Grant Road were once occupied by Marathis and Marwaris. \nToday, you will hardly find any Hindu merchant in this entire area. This change of demography did not happen suddenly. Leaders like Abu Azmi, Aslam Shaikh and Nawab Malik with Islamic organisations have worked very hard for this to happen. NCP and Shiv Sena extended them full support! These people have formed an organization! When a Muslim from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Bangla Desh or any Rohingya comes to Mumbai, he goes to the nearest mosque. From there he is taken to the NGO's office of Nawab Malik or Aslam Shaikh or Abu Azmi. \nHis people do a complete survey of all the areas of Mumbai and the suburbs, in which area, whose business will run. Then that person is sent to do business at one place by giving him a handcart and complete equipment. That person keeps on giving money to the NGO from his business earnings. This way, lakhs of Muslims are being shifted into Mumbai! The demographics change of Mumbai is in full swing. Mira Road, Nalasopara, Bhiwandi, Mumbra, Bandra East, Khar, Grant Road, Byculla, Abdul Rehman Street, Mohammd Ali Road, Bombay Central, Crawford Market Santacruz, Andheri West, Jogeshwari, Oshiwara, Ram Mandir Station, Goregaon West, Malad West, Malwani, Charkop, and many other areas have gradually become a stronghold of the Muslim community. \n\nToday, there are many such areas in Mumbai where no Hindu person can hope to win an election! Nawab Malik, Aslam Shaikh and Abu Azmi have run a special drive under the leadership of NCP to recruit Muslims in Mumbai Police. Location coaching in Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli, Raigad, Ahmdnagar, Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai Central have been opened so that the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal can learn Marathi well, because the police recruitment paper is in Marathi. They have been given free accommodation and coaching facilities in all the cities, besides ₹8,000 Stipends were also given every month and a letter revealed that Nawab Malik wants that more than 30% of Muslims recruited in Maharashtra Police before 2023! \nPoor Aam Marathi manoos is roaming on the streets, raising slogans, unaware of how slowly the entire demography is very changed! *Shocking!* 🙄"<br />Author: 'Aaang-'  id: 'ucbutw'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ucbutw/islamisation_of_mumbai/</li>

It is your responsibility to understand that when you are fully yourself, in full authority, speaking your fullest truth, and being your fullest YOU... Even if some people aren\'t prepared to meet you there, you\'ll arrive at a powerful, no-nonsense place where only those who are worthy of being the magnificent, crazy, complex woman you are will stay with you and hold space for you. Those who weren\'t meant to meet you in the first place will simply fade away. And it hurts, but as someone who has gone through this exact same experience, I can assure you that it\'s the best thing that could happen to you. Be a little more totally you every day and watch what happens. When you\'re worried of being \'too much\', nudge or blast through the resistance you\'re experiencing. You owe it to yourself, and you deserve to be fully loved and witnessed in all of your intensity and depth. I, too, am theatrical, overthinking, and overly emotional at times. But I wasn\'t created with the goal of \'being as little, quiet, convenient, and accommodating as possible in order to be viewed as a decent lady.\' \n\nEvery person has their own shadows, traumas, good-bad duality, and sensitive triggers.

Muslims and Islam are not the same, islam and Judaism are not that different in terms of how violent they are(we too have castist scriptures which we denounce readily which called for violence) but today Jews are not just ahead of us Hindus but everyone in terms of science and technology, many Jews today eat pork today even though it's against Judaism because they have recontextualized those practices into their faith does it mean Judaism is okay with eating pork? No it just means Jews have changed, so can Muslims, we know that so much of radicalization in madarsas and mosques was happening due to salafi and Wahhabi money that Saudi was pushing to gain influence, today Saudi itself is reforming itself celebrating and practicing yoga, they have banned hijab and they are curtailing salafis and Wahhabi influence in their drive to modernize, there are many critical thinking clerics within countries like Indonesia who are trying to become mainstream voice who call for critical thinking regarding practices that only made sense in 7th century middle East and not a multi cultural multi religious society, why don't we try to promote these voices as opposed to act like a giant war needs to be fought to solve this? When I read posts here it seems like most of you have never talked with a Muslim family in your life, that certainty explains your imagination and hate, it's way easier to create fantasies when you haven't talked with them, you'll be surprised at how similar they are to you, most Muslim parents and grandparents do express the same sentiment of their children not being into religious activities and only doing it for appreance, nobody chooses to be born into the religion they were born Ito, why are you acting like being a Muslim is some original sin that can't be repented lol"<br />Author: 'yash_blue'  id: 'uc1une'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uc1une/why_is_this_this_subreddit_so_hateful_towards/</li>

      <li>Title::: "I lost my mother, my grandfather (maternal), and my grandmother (paternal) between November 2019 and April 2021. I feel empty. I still haven't recovered."<br />Body: "I know, I never will recover. I am only left with my father and my two sisters. The span of one and half years took everything from me. My mother's passing hurt me the most. It wasn't time for her to leave me. She used to smile all the time. I have so many regrets that I just can’t express. I wanted to do so many things for her.\n\nMy parents' life had been full of struggles. They worked hard and spent their sweat and tears to raise us. In 2019, I started doing freelance work and started to earn enough to start making their quality of life better. My mother and father were very happy. Although my father was a bit miffed because he thought that I was wasting my time on earning money and not focusing on studies, but he was proud as well. My parents loved each other as well. I had seen them fight seriously many times. But I also had seen them be lovey dovey and seriously flirt with each other (the way Indian parents do). Once my mother passed away, we all felt broken. My sisters were the most broken after my father.\n\nI, for myself, don't even know what I felt. For some reason, I haven't been able to cry for the past few years. It's like I have become a man of stone. But, often times in solitude, I remember all that I lost and I feel heavy. I want to cry. I seriously want to cry. But I am not able to. I also want to let out all my pain. I want to vent it out. But I just can't. There is just this heavy feeling and it makes me think and remember things. I feel absolutely powerless in front of these feelings. I have slowly got myself on track and tried to start working again and start focusing on studying again. I had lost all motivation for doing anything when my mother passed away. I still just can't gather all my motivation. I feel hopeless and just feel like it's all worthless and pointless. I then convince myself and start working back, but it is always there in the back of my mind. I have no friends. I myself left whatever friend circle of two or three friends I had. I felt a bit demeaned then, so I thought I should better leave.\n\nMy sisters are both graduating and preparing for masters. I just don't know what I can do. I try to motivate them, but feel hollow for saying things I don't myself not follow up on. My father is so lonely. He is a man of principles, so as a result has no friends. I just look at my family and feel heavy again. I just don't know what I can do to get myself on track. Most of the time, I get lost in fantasies of how I have turned back time and changed all the unfavorable things and that my parents and sisters are living happily. I just can't get myself out of those daydreams. I am wishing for a miracle, while being fully aware they won't ever come true. My family is supportive of me too, but I just don't know how to support them and make them smile from inside once more. I have a girlfriend too, who has been really supportive. However, she is living in a different city because of studies.\n\nI just don't know what to do!"<br />Author: 'forprofitkiss'  id: 'ubsw10'<br />Score:80<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ubsw10/i_lost_my_mother_my_grandfather_maternal_and_my/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'RRR has been an absolutely exhilarating experience. Most entertaining movie this year hands down (NWH included)'<br />Body: "I went into the theatre half-convinced and a little sceptical after watching KGF. No insults to KGF, but just hero elevation does little for me. \nAnyway, the hope that I did have from RRR was that the comments from people saying that if you liked Bahubali, you will like RRR. I was definitely hoping to see good fight choreography and adrenaline-inducing moments. But once the movie started, it gave me everything as a viewer and more. \n\nMAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n* The moment ram gets dragged into the crowd and is overwhelmed by a mob, I was already cringing in expectation for him to now show his strength and toss away 20 people at once, but the movie revealed a much more realistic, much more believable approach.\n\n* The CGI and VFX were astounding, to say the least. Sophisticated, rarely over the top, and used in the perfect amount.\n\n* Sound Design was tailored for the theatre experience and hit all the right notes(no pun intended).\n\n* The story kept on giving. I swear that just the first half can be produced as a separate movie in itself. The latter is just tonnes of cherries on top.\n\n* As I said before, I went in expecting a fight fest filled with over-the-top masculinity, instead what I got was an emotional roller coaster of wholesome bromance. The story so engaging, with many layers, yet neatly packaged for the viewer to clearly understand.\n\n* The use of Bollywood celebrities was done less to cash in on their face values (which is extremely rare). The presence of Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan could've easily been hyper glamorised. Instead what we got were two actors, straight to their script and honest to their characters. They were neither special nor lame. They were perfectly what they needed to be. \n\n* I am from North India so I understand that Telugu/Kannada/Tamil action and dance sequences are generally a little too much for a lot of us. But damn if this wasn't way more dignified. Even the Naacho dance sequence that I initially cringed at, left me with my jaw dropped. A dance sequence....left me speechless. Has never happened before with me at least. \n\n* The seamless merging of fantasy, mythology, history, and divinity was unforeseen, even by the standards of Bahubali. \n\n* Religious harmony is depicted almost to perfection.\n\n* One thing that unfortunately I had to constantly do was to wonder the kind of reaction by the world if the same sort of movie was made by the US or the UK. If a similar story was written by a westerner. Would we perceive it to be better? Would we cringe at it less? If the same actions were done in a marvel movie, would we revel in its glory? Would it be more believable? \nExercising this constantly throughout the movie surely highlighted the depth of colonization that each and every one of us still has in our minds. I am deeply indebted to Rajamouli for raising the bar this high for moviemakers. The masterpiece speaks for itself. \n\nThere are a hundred more things that I would like to type out here, but the key point would be\n\n&gt; Go and watch the damn movie. It is brilliant!\n\nFor all my North Indians out there, a piece of general advice is to get used to Marathi, Telugu, Malayali, Tamil cinema (I'm not familiar with Kannadiga, so not commenting) It is leagues above Bollywood in every sense, and all of them have their own flavours and motifs that are extremely fun.\n\nI will definitely rewatch this movie whenever I get time, no doubt about it."<br />Author: 'kking4'  id: 'ubqj3f'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ubqj3f/rrr_has_been_an_absolutely_exhilarating/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why we commit tactical blunders in academic discourses?'<br />Body: ' \n\nI am new to this sub and share the sentiments of the fellow members here. I think we commit huge tactical( and sometimes also strategic blunders) when dealing with establishing or even inserting narratives or counternarratives into mainstream. We tend to think with out heart not our head.\n\nIf we need our own counternarrative mechanism we shouldn\'t be isolating ourselves, instead keeping a low profile while maintaining credibility. A common misconception people generally fall for is that the more Indian scholars/journalists/media persons we have, the stronger will the narrative be. I disagree with this.\n\nWe have to accept that the west controls the narrative today, there is no point in us either stonewalling there academic material and living in an echo chamber of our own or beating our own arguments like a dead horse. That makes us look like fundamentalists. We need to slightly smart about this.\n\nWe need to be sneaking our way into the western conglomerate while maintaining our own identity (very much possible) like say Israel has done, have a proper machinery to combat\n\na)blatantly false propaganda - like saying that there is a a genocide happening in Kashmir, can be solved by heavily using cameras. Meaning that false propaganda can always be solved by going back to first principle.\n\nb)slightly nuanced information warfare - This is where we continuously commit tactical blunders. We need to understand that no matter how many scholars/YouTube channels/journalists/podcasts we have we will never get the credibility and network access that the west has. This is where we can make very good use of NRI Indians, we literally have them sitting everywhere.\n\nWe also have to understand that we are not an economically strong a country as France or Israel, who sometimes even isolate themselves from American/western influence. We are a country susceptible to regime change or being used as a vassal - when we see a lot of western countries trying to get India on their side, it is not because of our "geopolitical" or "strategic" importance, it is because they want to use us as a pawn, like the US used Ukraine. How? When? Where? , we never know, but that has been the strategy of the west since time immemorial.\n\nSadly the government is only interested in winning elections, but there are still a lot of things that can be done.\n\nThe first and foremost being educating ourselves. Without that, the best we will get is Ramdas Athawale shouting Karuna go! Karuna go!\n\nExamples - Considering the AIT/OIT debate - we cannot afford to make arguments like "The AMT is based on a colonial/racist mindset"/"People propounding the AIT/AMT are racists". Stuff like this doesn\'t work. To beat any theory with that level of academic consensus we need proper arguments BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CREDIBLITY AND NETWORK ACCESS. No matter how right a person like Shrikant Talageri might be, he has neither.\n\nWe need to be joining them on certain fronts and distancing ourselves on others because that is how pop culture is today. Example - I see so many Indians supporting Russia in the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Supporting the illegal invasion and regime change does absolutely nothing for our narrative yet we do it, again giving us the reputation of being bigots. We need to stop committing such rookie mistakes and focus more on credible arguments at the least, credibility will be achieved through different means.\n\nThrough this kind of a mechanism, we will win some and lose some but we will learn from our mistakes and MAYBE JUST MAYBE we will be able to create an intellectual class in India.\n\nIf adopting this strategy means cowering to the west on certain topics, so be it. Our priority has to be getting the two important things CREDIBILITY and NETWORK ACCESS, Since we already have people like Vikram Sampath, Talageri, Elst, not to mention scholars in the past like Savarkar, we already have the talent with us.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.'<br />Author: 'Born_Winter3904'  id: 'ubos8j'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ubos8j/why_we_commit_tactical_blunders_in_academic/</li>

I noticed this being mentioned in pakistani circles and immediate stop to establishment support to anti-shia sentiment inside the country after Arya made a video on how it could damage them.\n\n3) His calls for Nawaz Sharif to return and how Sheikh Rashid is an asset for India among many other things. I believe he has, like a teacher, helped Orient pakistani politicians on how to navigate waters.\n\n4) His videos on Imran khan and his flaws have imo catalysed his ouster. Not only this, after his ouster, saying imran did better than any raw agent could, means he is signalling to the pak establishment that they have done the right thing.\n\n5) If you think defensive offense is not impactful, i urge you to think otherwise. It is watched by Pakistanis at all levels of leadership. It's like a university professor mocking them, making them stronger by showing them their own face while no longer providing us with any useful insight. It's entertainment for some, but i believe it is helping not us, but the enemy. \n\nI don't believe this is intentional.

But the state governments must also take responsibility to do work to implement them effectively. Even in BJP ruled states, the state governments are being extremely irresponsible and corrupt. The principles and trust by which the BJP came to power in centre is not being followed and upheld by their own governments in many states. They are actually, more confidently being shitty right now with the confidence that they can anyways win the elections by showing ModiJi's face. I am from Karnataka. we are a BJP ruled state. I agree, it's better than the Congress or JDS in Karnataka who are outright power hungry and shameless to an unimaginably disgusting extent. But, the BJP is only slightly better. They do try a little to maintain the party reputation that central leaders like Advaniji, Late Vajpayee ji, Late Sushma Swaraj ji, Amit Shah ji and Modi ji have built and don't be shamelessly corrupt in the open. But yes, it's still not less but immensely corrupt.Especially the municipality in Bengaluru. The BBMP is swallowing up 100s of crores of people's money every year and doing substandard and absolutely unnecessary works in a totally unplanned manner and wasting a lot of public money  as well as causing immense inconvenience to the daily life of people. They just got better at hiding the corruption. It slightly improved though after Basavaraj Bommai became CM. He's the most work oriented CM i have witnessed in my state (i'm 20). He's actually trying to bring about a few big changes and taking strong stands fearlessly though these old horses of his own party who have got used to the corrupt system constantly make it immensely difficult to do anything effectively. It's still better than Yediyurappa's time. Way better. These Veteran leaders who are too old to function efficiently like him and Eeshwarappa ( thank god there's a case against him right now. He's no longer a minister. should be kicked out of the party too.) didn't give a fuck about governance or the party reputation or the people. BSY was as disgustingly Power hungry ans Siddharamiah and Kumaraswamy. It was only about toppling down governments to bring new ones at that time. Neither the ruling nor the opposition cared about the state and it's ppl. At least low, inspired by the PM we do have a few work oriented genuine MLAs and MPs trying to develop their constituency(very few in number though). But on the whole, every party to form government in Karnataka sucks immensely and needs reforms. It's a sad state of affair to vote knowing that it's fucked up, but we gotta choose the least among them. which is like 5% less fucked up. The BJP in Karnataka needs a change in leadership in all sorts. Just retire the old ppl from power. make them political mentors and bring in the youngsters who are ready and waiting to create an impact. This should be done by all parties to form a capable opposition too. but the JDS is a dynastic party and hence we cannot expect anything. The Congress on the other hand has problems in the root where it snubs every talented and capable young leader in every state in order to keep their old horses in power. we all know how congress killed it's own potential for the personal benefit of a few ppl and hence, the party has no future now. It's dead. BJP is the only one we can expect to take drastic measures like changes in leaders and giving power to capable ppl and retiring the old horses. just hope the centre sees the problem here. The governance problem in Karnataka is pathetic. We need new leaders. Not politicians, we have enough of those. We need Leaders.\n\nThat's the rant.

And then i searched up that "what if japan conquered india?" \n\nAnd i came to know they ***actually did!!!*** (Andaman and Nicobar Islands)\n\nAnd here going to share what crimes they committed there because im sure most of us don\'t know about this dark history.  \n\nSo let\'s begin.\n\nMany of you would have come across South Koreans and Malaysians protest against Japan for the inhuman use of Korean and Malay women as comfort ladies during World War II. These are women abducted from their home country in order to serve the Japanese Imperial army stationed around South East Asia during World War II. Digging more on this war crime I came across a surprise I found some of them landed in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Little did I know that Anadaman and Nicobar was occupied by Japanese for a short period of time and witnessed the worst massacre in the history of mankind not know to many\n\nAndaman and Nicobar islands are part of British India and a battalion of Sikh Regiment was stationed there during World War II. Its distance from India’s Mainland is large and relatively takes much time for a news to reach either side. The Japanese army entered into Port Blair the capital city on 23 March 1942. The local residents initially welcomed the Japanese troops and considered them as the liberation army liberating them from the clutches of the British. Within hours of their arrival Japanese troops started looting the island for food and started facing confrontation from the local residents. They shot people who resisted against their cruel intentions. Under the leadership of Dr Diwan Singh a peace committee was formed in order to facilitate a smooth relationship between the occupying Japanese forces and the local population. And it ended in vain with many of the leaders in the committee were jailed,killed or exiled to Singapore labelled as spies for British.Forced labour camps were created and the Japanese started constructing an airport near Port Blair. As much as 600 people were killed during the first half of the occupation\n\nThe island came under the pseudo control of Azad Hind goverment of Subash Chandra Bose. This was just a name sake government. The real power was with the Japanese forces. The atrocities never ended and at at its peak the Homefreyganj massacre took place. On a single day close to 44 members of the Indian Independence League were shot as spies to the British.Yes Indian Independence League is Subash Chandra Bose headed organisation and the irony is too good.With war closing in all fronts the Japanese were in shortage of food and supplies so they decided to move large portion of the local population to nearby island to start agriculture.\n\nOn their way their ship sank letting close to 700 dead and only 12 survived. Many historians argue that Japanese forces did this to reduce the island population as food was less. The terror reign caused death toll of close to 20000 which was 10 percent of the total population. The violence on women reached untold measures.\xa0\n\nOn top of this Subash Chandra Bose himself visited the island once during the occupation.\n\nDid he know the atrocities happening in the island?\n\nOnly time can answer this question……….'<br />Author: 'Flimsy-Possible-7706'  id: 'uauq4i'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uauq4i/heard_of_japanese_war_crimes_on_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Remnants of prudishness from the colonial rule get to define Indian Culture today.'<br />Body: "In ancient India, stitched apparel was never a morality-deeming part of a woman’s wardrobe. In many parts of India prior to the arrival of the Victorian mind (i.e the British invasion of our country), blouses under saris was not a thing. The sari was an unstitched drape worn bare-breasted or, in some areas, with a separate piece of cloth to support the bust. The covering of the breasts had little to do with propriety. It was the rise of foreign influences - empires that ruled our land with Abrahamic religion (Islam &amp; Christianity) - that brought in degrees of body-shaming to the Indian female form. \n\nIt was Jnanadanandini Debi, the wife of Satyendranath Tagore, who popularised blouses and the modern style of the saree in India. This was done because reportedly she was refused entry to clubs under the British Raj for wearing the sari fabric over her bare breasts. \n\nSo the saree with a blouse is actually a West-influenced modern evolution of the saree, NOT what the saree is supposed to be. And certainly not the ideal to hold, definitely not the standard by which you shame other kinds of drapes. There are still Hindu temples where only the purest form of a saree ensemble - with no stitched blouse or petticoat - is permitted inside the holy property. Quite hilariously, at the same time, there are holier-than-thou gatekeepers of iNdiAn CuLtuRe that bemoan endlessly about 'Western influences ruining Indian culture' and shame women who choose to unblouse in that very same breath. The saree blouse has been Britain’s longest export to India, which uninformed and history-deaf sheeple are so loudly proclaiming as an Indian tradition. This was a country where the culture of an invader demonized, villainized and vulgarized women's bodies, and we make sure to keep carrying forward THEIR script of oppression. \n\nWhat even is Indian Culture, after all the cultures that invaded and ruled it with their own? Why do remnants of prudishness from the colonial rule get to define it today? \n\nThe point here is, who are you? To tell a woman how she may saree?

      <li>Title::: 'Alleged beheading of Teg Bahadur (9th Guru Of Sikhs) because of his religious restrictions; and the myth of him being executed while saving Kashmiri Hindus'<br />Body: 'The death of the 9th Guru of the Sikhs, Teg Bahadur, around the year 1675 CE. Given the political landscape of North India at the time, we would expect accounts from two possible sources: the Sikh sources themselves, and the Persian sources (by Islamic historians).\n\nThere are no Sikh sources that are even within a century of the event. In that case, we must turn our attention to the Persian sources. The earliest account of this episode comes from the **\'Siyar-ul-Mutakherin\' by \'Sayyid Ghulam Hussain Tabatabai\'** completed in 1781 CE.\n\n\'The Siyar\' is a highly reputed source for many reasons. Ghulam Hussain was born into an aristocratic Muslim (Shia) family in Delhi in around 1727 CE. He was from the nobility: his family was related to Alivardi Khan, with whom they migrated to Murshidabad in 1732. His father was Bakshi of Zainuddin Ahmad Khan (son-in-law of Alivardi Khan). As such he would have had access to sources and accounts from higher levels of officialdom. He was also born in Delhi, less than 50 years after this event, and although he released the Siyar in 1781 CE, one would expect that work in gathering sources perhaps started much earlier.\n\n**Conclusion from \'The Siyar\':-** Teg Bahadur had teamed up with one Hafiz Adam, a follower of Sirhindi, and the combined followers of these two were plundering parts of Punjab and levied contributions on Hindus. For this, they were both arrested by Aurangzeb, and ordered to send Hafiz Adam to today’s Afghanistan, while Teg Bahadur was ordered to be sent to Gwalior. There, he, after sometime was finally executed.\n\n**Reasons why the above account of the Siyar is believable:-** Ghulam Hussain has, before given a detailed account of the previous Gurus. That account is on the whole, favourable, and therefore bespeaks to a fair manner of reporting of Sikhs in general. There is no trace of any prejudice towards Sikhs in general, and indeed he speaks of “Nanak Guru” with esteem. The verifiable details of that account are all accurate; the details of the succession of the Gurus are accurate. The level of detail in this particular account matches that of other episodes in the Siyar; it does not seem to be made up at a different level of detail than normal and therefore does not stand out as being inserted artificially. In addition, the Siyar provides an Islamic accomplice (Hafiz Adam) of Tegh Bahadur who is said to be his partner in collecting money from people. Therefore, it does not seem like a made-up account motivated by any religious impulse to tarnish Sikhs. Lastly, Ghulam Hussain has been accused of being sympathetic to his fellow Shias in his history: if the alleged torture of Teg Bahadur on the basis of religious reason  by a Sunni monarch (Aurangzeb) were true, it is hard to believe that Ghulam Hussain would have missed the chance to report it.\n\nSince the time of the fourth Guru Arjun, who had organized ‘masands’ to collect tithes from his followers and others who lived in their areas of influence, the gurus of the Sikhs had been collecting money from those who lived in their areas of power, as an informal taxation system.  Given the brief confusion over the succession following the eighth Guru, with two claimants arising (Ram Rai and Teg Bahadur) and trying to get the favour of the Mughal throne to back their respective claims, it is expected that this system would have been briefly non-operational and defunct.\n\nAs such, it would be expected that once Teg Bahadur assumed the position of the Guru, he would have tried to revive the system of tithe collection of his predecessors. It seems this is what he was trying to do in partnership with Hafiz Adam: the account of the Siyar seems to be accurately depicting such a highly likely endeavour by Teg Bahadur.\n\nLater narratives, specifically those where Teg Bahadur is arrested only for being a religious preacher. Firstly, there is no other account written even within 50 years after the \'Siyar\'. The \'Sikh accounts\' are from the early 19th century, and themselves seem to be interpolated even then. For example, the highly mythologized description of Teg Bahadur coming to the aid of persecuted Kashmiri Hindus only appears in the third edition of **Gur Bilas Dasvin**, not in the first two editions (The first edition of Gur Bilas Dasvin by Sukha Singh is dated 1797 CE), but in only as late as 1848 CE.\n\nIf we look at Aurangzeb’s reign, it is true that he revived the Jaziya and ordered large-scale destruction of temples. However, there are no records of him picking up Hindu preachers and executing them. And in a domain as vast as his, it is for sure that numerous Hindu preachers of various sects and beliefs preached. So it is hard to believe that Teg Bahadur was picked up for resisting Aurangzeb’s proselytization in Kashmir—this is the account currently most narrated as part of the mythology of Teg Bahadur.\n\nAt the time of Teg Bahadur’s death, Kashmir had a liberal-minded Muslim ruler, whose right-hand man himself was Hindu. In any case, the Islamization of the Kashmir valley had already taken place much earlier, during the rule of Sikandar ‘Butshikan.’\n\nAnother corroborating evidence comes from the \'Zafarnama\', written by the son of Teg Bahadur, \'Govind Rai (later Gobind Singh)\' to Aurangzeb himself. Had there been truth to the later mythologies **[whose salient features are (a) defence of Kashmiri Hindus and (b) torture]**, these would have been mentioned at least in Gobind Singh’s long communication with the alleged perpetrator of these atrocities. The fact that Gobind Singh speaks of so many issues, including his own perception of unfair treatment at the hands of Aurangzeb that led to the death of his children, yet he does not make any mention of the alleged (by later mythologies) murder of his own father, Teg Bahadur. This would be hard to believe had the events of those later mythologies actually been true. Also, the claim that his father was killed merely for his religious resistance is at odds with the fact that Govind Singh tried incessantly to meet with Aurangzeb, sending him many letters, and was on his way to the Deccan to meet him when the latter (i.e., Aurangzeb) died. Had Teg Bahadur been treated as alleged by Aurangzeb, it is hardly likely that his son would be in such a need to meet him, knowing that his own fate might not be different.\n\n**Aurangzeb was not present in Delhi/Agra for over a year around the time of the alleged beheading of Teg Bahadur:-** From the most definitive accounts of his reign—the \'Maasir-i-Alamgiri\' by \'Saqi Mustʾad Khan\', he (Aurangzeb) departed towards Hasan Abdal from Delhi in June 1674 to quell the Yusufzai-Afridi uprising and returned to Delhi only in March 1676, that is, three months after the alleged beheading of Teg Bahadur “by him” in the later mythologized narrative. It would seem that the chance and unusual absence of Aurangzeb from Delhi precisely during this period was accidentally overlooked by those that authored the later narratives.\n\n***\n\nInterestingly, several court petitions were filed against Bipan Chandra’s \'Medieval India\' for stating the account in the Siyar. The petitions objected to this account not on any historical grounds, but on the grounds that it "hurt the sentiments of a community". The petition gathered enough strength to force the author to remove the account of the Siyar from the book. **Such politically motivated omission of accounts that do not suit the narratives being sought to be built is harmful to the pursuit of history: of what actually happened.**\n\nDeleted passage:-\n\n&gt;"In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was arrested... and executed. The official explanation for this... is that after his return from Assam, the Guru... had resorted to plundering and rapine, laying waste the Punjab. According to Sikh tradition, the execution was due to the intrigues of some members of his family who disputed his succession... Aurangzeb was annoyed because the Guru had converted a few Muslims to Sikhism... For Aurangzeb, the execution of the Guru was only a law and order question."\n(\'Medieval India\', by Satish Chandra)\n\n**What of the Gurudwara Sisganj then?** The current building dates only to around 1930 and is said to have been constructed on an older building that dates to the so-called “Delhi Fateh” of 1783 (this event finds no mention in standard accounts of Delhi of that time, and the Sikh accounts first appear in a later hagiographic work, the Panth Prakash of Giani Gian Singh). Historical records of the late 18th century describe Sikhs as bands of looters and lawless raiders. During that time period, Delhi proper, especially the Red Fort and its surroundings, was in control of either the Marathas or the British. We have accounts of multiple sources, including the envoy of the East India Company who was stationed in the Red Fort. These do not corroborate the “Delhi Fateh” account. Instead, the records of around 1783 suggest only that Sikhs plundered and reached up till Barari. So this “Delhi Fateh” too is an exaggerated portrayal of this plundering raid.\n\nGiven that, the claim that (a) the spot of Teg Bahadur’s alleged beheading was because of religious reasons, and (b) a Gurudwara built during this excursion does not bear close historical scrutiny. Furthermore, even that raid was over 100 years after the death of Teg Bahadur, and after the completion of \'The Siyar\' too!'<br />Author: 'JimmyHopkins06'  id: 'uahvfe'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/uahvfe/alleged_beheading_of_teg_bahadur_9th_guru_of/</li>
