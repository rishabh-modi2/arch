Have been meaning to post this since quite a few days. \n\nGarbhagṛha (गर्भगृह, “womb-house”).—When combined the two words [garbha (womb) and gṛha (accommodation)] become garbhagṛha (womb-house). It denotes the sanctum sanctorum, or shrine of a sacred space, especially that of a Hindu temples. The sanctum sanctorum is the most central and fundamental component of any sacred architecture. What garbha (womb) is to the human body gṛha (accommodation) and guhā (cave) are to the world of habitation. What gṛha is to the world of habitation garbhagṛha is to the sacred architecture. In garbha resides the foetus, the genesis of a being. In gṛha, resides the gṛhastha, the family man—the microcosm, a unit, of which the multiples make a society, and which is opposed to the macrocosmic sphere of civilization. In the microcosmic sphere of the garbhagṛha, the God resides, who is referred to as the macrocosm in religions, the omnipresent, all-pervading entity.\n\nSource: Knowledge Traditions &amp; Practices of India: Architecture (1): Early and Classical Architecture\nGarbhagṛha (गर्भगृह) refers to the “sanctum sanctorum”, a common concept found in the ancient Indian “science of architecture” (vāstuvidyā).—Garbhagṛha is the sanctum sanctorum, where the presiding deity is installed.\n\nSource: Shodhganga: The significance of the mūla-beras (vastu)\nGarbhagṛha (गर्भगृह) or Mūlasthāna sanctum-sanctorum of the Hindu Temple.—Each temple has a mūlasthāna or garbhagṛha (sanctum-sanctorum) and many subsidiary sanctums.

At this juncture Swami Vivekananda endowed with Vedantic knowledge proclaimed that it can be deduced that the 4 are not only inter-related but also that energy and matter are interchangeable in the space and time domains. However, there was no mathematical formulation available at that time. In fact, he had written to Tesla to formulate a necessary theory related to energy and matter and their inter-convertibility.\n\nTesla was very much impressed to hear from Swami Vivekananda his explanation of the Sankhya cosmology and the theory of cycles believed by the Hindus. He was struck by the resemblance between Sankhya theory of matter and energy and modern physics.\n\nSwami Vivekananda had said: “*We have matter and force. The matter, we do not know how, disappears into force and force into matter. Therefore there is something which is neither force nor matter, as these two may not disappear into each other. This is what we call the universal mind*.”\n\nThe mathematical proof of this principle came only 10 years later when Einstein published his paper of relativity and formulated E=mc2 and mentioned that matter is just potential energy.\n\n[https://srkviti.org/swami-vivekananda-on-science-and-education/](https://srkviti.org/swami-vivekananda-on-science-and-education/)'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 's28mw1'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s28mw1/swami_vivekananda_a_decade_before_einstein_proved/</li>

The Manhattan project—** \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*THE KAUTILYA LECTURES:*\n\n*“THE INSTITUTION OF SPIES”*\n\n*By Professor Chanakya.*\n\n*Delivered initially in the 156th year of Magadha hegemony at Taxila, Gandhara to the following students:* \n\n*- Apratimaujas a brahmana of Gokula, Shurasena*\n\n*- Dandasharman a brahmana of Ujjain, Malwa*\n\n*- Panini a brahmana of Salatura, Gandhara*\n\n*- Pabbata a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Chandragupta a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Shribhanu a kshatriya of Kundagrama, Vajji*\n\n*Transcribed later from memory by Shribhanu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara Nakshatra.*\n\n*Edited and organized at the word of Professor Chanakya by the Yavana lady Tara.* \n\nThe security of a state depends on the loyalties of its elements of sovereignty: of the king, the minister, the treasury, the army, the fort, the country and the allies. There are numerous means of securing such loyalties, and there are numerous means for them to be secured or seized by the enemy. This game played between a king and his enemy is termed war.\n\nA formal declaration does not mark the start of war, similarly a peace treaty does not mark its end, only that of open war. War is perpetual, in one form or the other, and a king cannot rest even after he has completed a conquest, for the continued possession of an article requires continued active participation in such war as it persists.\n\nIt is then asked: how can such mighty forces – a great army, great wealth, a great population and country, large numbers of secure fortresses, foreign kings, the intellect of ministers – be made loyal to the will of a king alone?\n\nBharadvaja says the king must be like a lion in the forest: even though he is small in number, he is far too powerful to be defeated by animals that are more numerous.\n\nParasara says he must be like a mahout controlling an elephant: even though he is weaker than the elephant, he is able to control it by virtue of his position and tools.\n\nBut these are not correct: a king need not be the mightiest of his country, either intellectually, physically or otherwise; indeed, such strengths may be suited to other economic pursuits than kingship. Nor may a country be compared to an elephant, as unlike an elephant it contains men with intellect and technology equal or superior to that of the king.\n\nThus, I say he must be like a sluice in a canal – or like any other machine. \n\n“I believe that control over a large army requires a larger army,” says Pabbata, “And likewise for a treasury, a country, a fort, an ally, and an intellect. Is this not so?”\n\nNo, as such demands would be infinite – even if you secure frontier articles in this way, the capital would still remain unsecured, as the chaotic political history of Magadha attests. And although the Persians claim that they have achieved stability by seizing powerful articles away from the countries they conquer, this alone cannot guarantee stability, as the king still assigns these articles to his subordinates; furthermore such centralization is an obstacle to mobility; as a result, Persia is weak at fighting on multiple fronts.\n\nMuch as a small sluice controls a far more powerful current, much as a lever controls the heavy projectiles loaded onto a catapult, much as a switch controls the flow of activity to a mill from a load raised by a water-wheel; similarly large elements may be controlled by small ones placed strategically and with intrigue.\n\nSuch small elements are termed spies.\n\nSpies are secret by default, and are not allowed to admit their role or source of income to even those close to them – why?\n\n“Because wise council lies in not revealing what one has determined to carry out,” says Chandragupta.\n\nThe goal of spies is to ensure loyalty among the elements of sovereignty. To this end, they carry out the following three types of operations:\n\n(\\*) gathering intelligence on and influencing the opinions and plans of ministers, officials, army, forts, country and allies\n\n(\\*) scouting and affecting the same of an ally, enemy or neutral state \n\n(\\*) conducting covert operations against an enemy\n\nA spy may allure various members to betray the king and test their loyalties in this way. Such allurement may be in the form of persuasion, bribery, threats or deceit.\n\nAllurement by bribery is the most crucial as it is such methods that are used by enemies most frequently: bribery includes bribery by wealth, positions of power, sexual favours and other incentives. \n\nAllurement by persuasion is second most crucial: a spy may speak ill of the king in confidence to the subject, and if the latter agrees, he may be disposed from his position as he is seen as susceptible to being turned by persuasion. \n\nAllurement by threats is crucial to maintain discipline among officials and the army: those who successfully resist such threats and report them to the king risking their lives may be heralded for their courage without making it publicly known that the threat was an intelligence operation. \n\nAllurement by deceit may be done to prevent subjects from having their superstitions exploited by tricks and contravariances used by the enemy. \n\nThus the firmness, honesty, courage and intelligence of subjects may be tested by spies through the respective methods of gathering intelligence. \n\nSpies may also conduct simpler listening and propaganda operations to the same end.\n\nLikewise for spies scouting and affecting foreign countries and their articles. \n\nCovert operations conducted by spies sabotage one or more of the enemy’s elements of sovereignty.\n\nSabotage of the king and minister is assassination.\n\nSabotage of forts and armies is infiltration; these involve replacing army men and merchandise with inferior quality or traitorous substitutes, and of smuggling weapons into forts.\n\nSabotage of the treasury is looting.\n\nSabotage of the country is the destruction or seizure of farm and mine produce, poisoning of streams and livestock, and the obstruction of roads.\n\nSabotage of the ally is obstructing or falsifying messages sent and received by the enemy.\n\nThe following applies to all kinds of spying operations: just as a chariot may be pulled by an excess of horses tied in such a way that the vehicle is still functional when one of them is slain, at least three spies should be issued independently towards one goal without being revealed to each other, and their reports should be checked to agree – this way, spies can be made to spy on one another, and their loyalties can be checked. \n\nSimilarly, the spies and the espionage institutions should not be known to each other. This is to prevent the formation of conspiracies against the government, and to prevent captured spies from revealing information that compromises other spies or operations of the government. \n\nSimilarly, spies should be trained to use special pre-defined symbols – if their tasks are sufficiently generic, they should be trained to communicate in cipher. \n\nSpies must be recruited from all walks of life. Those in all four stages of life – students, householders, recluses and ascetics – may all be recruited. Of chief importance are merchants, prostitutes, cooks and such servants, respected heroes and colleagues of the subject being spied on. \n\nCriminals are particularly useful as spies, especially when it is not known to themselves that they are being used as spies. Such spies may also be used in situations where it is necessary to make a show of executing the spy after the operation is conducted. \n\nFinally, a king may keep a known traitor, corrupt official, criminal or incompetent in his government for several reasons, including: pooling of intelligence about other traitors from those who associate with the known traitor, centrally manipulating such other traitors through the known traitor, use as a scapegoat in public relations disasters, use as fodder in various operations. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Spies set up by foreign kings shall also be found out by local spies; spies by spies of like profession. It is the institutes of espionage, secret or avowed, that set spies in motion.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.12:24\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Thus with regard to kings who are inimical, friendly, intermediate, of low rank, or neutral, and with regard to their eighteen government departments, spies shall be set in motion.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.12:20\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Those whose sons and wives are kept (as hostages) shall be made recipients of salaries from two states and considered as under the mission of enemies.

If they frequently differ, the spies concerned shall either be punished in secret or dismissed.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.12:15-16\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The immediate officers of the institutes of espionage shall by making use of signs or writing set their own spies in motion \\[to ascertain the validity of the information\\].

Not a wicked sort of laugh that one may have expected from the caricatures of him in plays – a jovial and genuine laugh of amusement.*\n\n*“I don’t know why you ever sent me a messenger, Great King,” he said lightly, addressing his rival, “I made my goals quite clear to you from the start, did I not? What would your messenger have negotiated?”*\n\n*The Licchavi Chief smiled nervously.* \n\n*“For that matter, what have you come to talk about?” Ajatashatru continued. “I could kill you right now, you know, just as I did to the messenger,” —the Licchavis unsheathed their swords and acted offended; Ajatashatru ignored them and addressed the courtiers— “What would you do about it? Ooh don’t shoot the messenger! But what if the messenger shoots you? I jest, I jest. War between us will not benefit anybody. Besides me.” The Magadhan king bared his teeth.*\n\n*Trying not to look appalled, the Licchavi Chief folded his hands: “Great King … I have come to surrender to you.”*\n\n*“Oh? Could you not have just killed yourself? Please do not be offended! I would quite enjoy murdering you myself, Great King, but I am quite the busy man, you know.”*\n\n*The Magadhan chortled heartily, his courtiers laughing alongside him, while his rival was sweating. He turned to the Licchavi Minister.*\n\n*“Ah, Chief Minister!” he cried. “How stoic your face is – how manlily you stand! You must be so intelligent, so firm, so righteous! And yet you lose to me – a short Magadhi barbarian who regards himself a genius for having invented one intrigue, while in the Western realms, educated Brahmins like yourself revel in the study of hundreds of such devices of their own invention! Do you wish to know why, Chief Minister? Do you wish to know my secret – why I win, and you lose?”*\n\n*The Chief Minister did not answer.*\n\n*Ajatashatru continued.*\n\n*“Everywhere from Vaishali to Taxila, the Brahmins present themselves as the manly, decisive, realist defenders of Vedic civilization – of great ingenuity and strong morals – with a grand master-plan, to be playing an elaborate and complicated game, so that every loss is truly a step to an eventual victory – that they will never allow the great civilization of their construction to fall to a deranged lunatic like myself.”*\n\n*–he pointed at his own ridiculous wolf-skin outfit–*\n\n*“Beware the wolf in sheep’s skin, they say! But I say: beware the sheep in wolf’s skin! Beware a man who possesses no goals but takes false glory from the appearance of a cunning, ambitious genius! That is all that most men are: sheep! and it is cheap to pretend – and pretending to be a wolf gives you all the benefits you desire: the vulvas of well-endowed women, social respect, some royal titles and grants – mainly the vulvas of well-endowed women – but the achievement of no real goals in life. And that is the reason why I win and you lose–”*  \n\n*The Magadhan king’s expression turned sombre, and he made an exaggerated gesture of clutching his temple with his forefingers and sniffling.* \n\n*“–because you truly do not even care about defeating me! You care about appearing to care about defeating me – because that speaks well of your sense of judgement of what ought to be, whether that signal is true or false.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru sniffled some more, then punched his own minister in the face to address him.* \n\n*“Do you want to know what I care about, Dirghalochana? Showing what, for once, a wolf – not even in sheep’s clothing – in wolf’s clothing–” he drew attention to his own attire “–can accomplish in a world of sheep. And that lesson, however expensive or destructive it may be, will be greatly beneficial to the world!”*\n\n*“Will it?” asked a courtier. Dirghalochana sighed internally as the king of Magadha sliced the annoyance in two.*\n\n*“Will it?” Ajatashatru mimicked. “I DON’T KN— I DON’T CARE if it is beneficial! That was a lie! I spoke, in very clear terms, about what I cared about: showing what one wolf can accomplish in a world of sheep. If that is all I care about, obviously I’m lying when I say that is motivated by an even deeper desire to benefit the world. Oh, but Ajatashatru, why did you lie? Why did you put on a pretense, why did you flash some sheep skin for a moment? Because I knew some idiot would say WILL IT REALLY? and I could then make an example out of him, and go on this whole rant; there are so many levels to my thinking, too deep for all your small intellects to comprehend, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep—” he gestured to those seated around him, “—Oh, and maybe I should just behead all of you, because you just believed the explanation I gave you for what I said and did, believed that I truly anticipated and predicted the reaction in advance and plotted it all, much like the foolish Licchavi Chief who believed this about his Minister, and now you do not know what to believe, thus furthering my goal of demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep.”*\n\n*The king guffawed amusedly.*\n\n*And then his expression turned serious.*\n\n*“You know,” he said, “I’m very sad. Very lonely. When I ascended the throne of Magadha, I fantasized about fighting great wars, playing games of intrigue against intellects equal to my own in cunning and strategic acumen – to outsmart such minds and dominate them – to earn my victory, rather than simply have it be handed to me. But if my opponent’s goal is not to win at all, then what even is the game?”*\n\n*Ajatashatru beheaded the Licchavi Chief, whose allies rose in protest but quickly found themselves restrained by the Magadhas*\n\n*Forcing a smile, he asked no-one in particular: “But did I plan for that?”* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The arrow shot by an archer may or may not kill a single man; but skilful intrigue devised by wise men can kill even those who are in the womb.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 10.6:51\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*In the 162nd year of Magadha hegemony*\n\n*(330 BC)*\n\nFaced with war on two fronts, the mighty Persians retreated from the East, swearing to return once they had secured the Western frontier. \n\nConcurrently to the news of Persian retreat, Shashigupta advised the Arjunayanas to adopt a defensive posture against Magadha rather than to continue the pre-emptive strikes that had earlier been in motion.\n\nAlso concurrent to these events, Magadha received news of a rebellion in the Southern extremity of its empire, and diverted its forces to the city of Pratishthana. Investigation revealed that the rebellion had been instigated by a certain Sage Paramachintya, speculation on whose motives ranged from senility to rumours of a mysterious meeting with an anonymous visitor weeks prior.\n\nUnbeknownst to its government, an organized network of spies was growing its roots in Magadha, identifying each other with the symbol of a peacock.\n\nFar in the West, the city of Parsa burned. The regret-filled eyes of a young blonde man stared at a fallen statue of Kshayaarshaa, and asked:\n\n“*Shall I pass by and leave you lying here because of your invasion of Greece? Or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?*”'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 's1j2ul'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s1j2ul/the_great_empire_ch_2_mathura_kanda_24_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The True Problem with Caste'<br />Body: "I often differ in my opinion about caste from the wider public (and often this sub as well) so let me say a few words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCaste is an issue, but not for the widely-perceived reasons of oppression and division. As far as I can see today (and please correct me if I'm wrong – I'm not as well acquainted with all of India as much as many of you) being lower-caste is not really a problem or a source of oppression. Poverty certainly is an issue, and it impacts families of historically lower standing, but someone who is supposedly 'backward caste' is not systemically discriminated against simply because of their birth. The top leaders of this nation have come from the most humble caste-based backgrounds, so there is no widespread hatred of anyone lower-caste as far as I see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue, however, is the harmful utilisation of a caste identity for political gains, and this is where the real oppression occurs. In states like Tamil Nadu (and many others, I'm just not that familiar with them) local political offices are dominated by a certain powerful class. Even at the state level, places like Andhra Pradesh have had ruling parties based largely on a caste identity (like the Reddy caste dominating Telugu politics today). This hyper-charged caste affinity blocks out any chance for meritocracy in governance based on meaningless labels that lost their relevance centuries ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe often see caste in and of itself as an issue, but I'd have to disagree. One's caste can simply be a part of their family's unique rich heritage, and many traditions continue based on certain caste-based practises. This is also why caste can never be erased from the Indian psyche: each of us carries a millennia-old tradition, from the most prominent Indian royal houses to the most humble rural farming communities. Once these labels become more than just parts of our tradition and begin to hold weight on our system of governance and consequently our society, however, it becomes a truly damaging issue."<br />Author: 'MagnusTory'  id: 's1ehtt'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s1ehtt/the_true_problem_with_caste/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[TIL] Erwin Schrödinger, Noble Price Winner Physicist had firm belief in Upanishads.'<br />Body: "Erwin Schrödinger is considered one of the most important figures in scientific community for his contribution to developing many fundamentals of Quantum Theory. This theory is arguably the most important development in modern Physics. Let's look at one of his quotes:  \n\n\n“**Hence this life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece of  the entire existence, but is in a certain sense the whole; only this  whole is not so constituted that it can be surveyed in one single  glance. This, as we know, is what the Brahmins express in that sacred, mystic formula which is yet really so simple and so clear: Tat tvam asi,  this is you. Or, again, in such words as 'I am in the east and in the  west, I am below and above, I am this whole world**'.  \n\n\nThus you can  throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with  the certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you. You  are as firmly established, as invulnerable as she, indeed a thousand  times firmer and more invulnerable. As surely she will engulf you  tomorrow, so surely will she bring you forth anew to new striving and  suffering. And not merely 'some day': now, today, every day she is  bringing you forth, not once but thousands upon thousands of times, just  as every day she engulfs you a thousand times over. For eternally and  always there is only now, one and the same now; the present is the only  thing that has no end.”  \n**Taken from his book:** [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1157019.My\\_View\\_of\\_the\\_World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1157019.My_View_of_the_World)\n\nIt's a direct reference to core philosophy of Non-dualism in Upanishads. And term '**Tat tvam asi**' is taken directly from one of the Upanishads - [https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239307.html](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239307.html)  \n\n\n**Another quote:**\n\n“Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For  consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in  terms of anything else.” References non-dualism view of Vedanta that consciousness is a fundamental reality in itself. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351344275\\_Advaita\\_Vedanta\\_answer\\_to\\_the\\_hard\\_problem\\_of\\_consciousness\\_A\\_philosophical\\_review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351344275_Advaita_Vedanta_answer_to_the_hard_problem_of_consciousness_A_philosophical_review)  \n\n\nIt shows how well developed our science &amp; philosophy was in ancient India while west still believed in flat earth theory until very recently. These are not quotes taken out of context or something he made a passing reference to as you can do your own research to see how much he believed in Indian philosophy on subjects like consciousness and nature of existence etc. There are numerous such examples of many other great personalities affirming the teachings of ancient Indian traditions. More I read more I realize how great and well developed our civilization was even thousands of years ago. It's time we start introspecting how much brainwashed many Indians are about their own culture and heritage and blindly follow flat earth culture."<br />Author: 'abhiccc1'  id: 's1dagn'<br />Score:139<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s1dagn/til_erwin_schrödinger_noble_price_winner/</li>

But a lot of UC people seem to have the opinion, that caste based discrimination is bad, but there is nothing wrong in having a caste identity coz its our culture and past. \n\nBut my problem is with the fact that we still identify with our castes at all !! We have studied science and know that there is no biological difference between people of different castes or races. We know all humans are the same. \n\nTo define your identity by  the profession of your ancestors is just inherently unscientific. We know that professional skills are not passed down genetically. So there is no reason to classify entire progenies by profession. The whole premise of caste is ridiculous and illogical. \n\nWhy do we still hold onto our caste identities. Like even our names based on it. Wouldn't it be better for India as a country to en masse shun their caste identity and adopt a more rational approach to our personal lives."<br />Author: 'rui-koar'  id: 's0tkls'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0tkls/caste_is_inherently_unscientific_irrespective_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Case Study of why India needs more robust whistleblower protection law'<br />Body: "*\\[Had posted this few weeks back. Have been informed by Reddit admin that this was mistakenly deleted. So reposting\\]*\n\nNishith Desai Associates is a leading international law firm in India. It became a leading law firm in International Tax by specializing in Mauritius route. Few years back a whistleblower got hold of some incriminating documents revealing how this law firm has been abetting large scale tax evasion and approached law enforcement agencies with these documents. When the law firm got a sniff of this, it used its influence on the judiciary to block any inquiry against it and came down with a ton of bricks on the whistleblowever by abusing the legal system. It directly approached a Delhi High Court judge directly in his chamber, by passed the registry and due process to institute a confidential suit (CS(OS) 67/2020) against the whistleblower. It also got the judge to pass an ex-parte order to allow the law firm to raid the house of the whistleblower and seize all his computers and mobile phones. The order provided unlimited power to the law firm to do whatever it wished to in the house of the whistleblower. This suit and the order was kept confidential, so much so that the pseudonyms were used for the parties and the entire court file was kept in a sealed cover. The whistleblower was not even heard.\n\nI used to be part of the firm and have seen these developments from close quarter. I have penned this story in form of a wordpress blog **'The Fall of Nishith Desai'** (link to the blog at the bottom) which is best read bottom to top. I have reproduced the relevant chapters pertaining to the whistleblower harrassment below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Towards the end of 2019, Parul Jain was back at NDA. Nishithbhai’s ego had gotten a boost and he was not restraining himself from bragging that someone who had quit NDA to join a large and leading accounting firm, had come back to the “NDA family”, as he likes to call the firm.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, surprisingly there were no public announcements. Nishithbhai, PR saavy that he is, always ensures that such news gets published in the media. But in this case there was a complete silence. So much so that Parul’s name was not even added to the list of firm members on the NDA’s website, which is far better maintained than any other law firm in India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As we, lowly members of the firm, were to later find out, Nishithbhai had learned about “The Leak“. It it difficult for me to say if he learned it from his pals in the investigative agencies with whom Advocate Prashant Bhushan had shared this information, or it was Parul who informed him, though latter seems very unlikely.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For a couple of months we noticed nothing unusual. But things changed in February of 2020. No, it was not the outbreak of COVID-19 at NDA. It was worse. Initially, we noticed that Nishithbhai and senior ‘partners’ (Gowree Gokhale, Pratibha Jain, Vaibhav Parikh from New York) having frantic parlays which also involved Parul. Subsequently some of us were also roped in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nishithbhai had come up with a plan to plug “The Leak” – a plan that eventually turned out to be a total disaster. He decided that NDA will file a case against Parul’s husband alleging that he had stolen the data from Parul’s official laptop and was now blackmailing NDA to fire her, or else he will put that data in public domain and tarnish NDA’s reputation. Parul happily gave a statement to this effect, on the basis of which a case was prepared.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most of us advised Nishithbhai to abandon the plan and instead strike a deal with Parul’s husband or Adv Bhushan. Or just disown the leaked data, if the need ever arises. But Gowree supported the plan and Nishithbhai decided to go ahead with it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was crucial that this case had to be kept confidential as it would have been fatal if the clients came to know of the leak. The objective was to use shock and awe, and intimidate Parul’s husband. This is where the unmatched research capability of NDA came in handy. The firm can find solutions in law, which are generally unknown. Instead of filing a criminal complaint for theft and defamation, which would be very difficult to keep confidential, we figured out that a civil suit would work better.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Delhi High Court, inspired by the US and UK jurisprudence, had constituted confidentiality club in some matters pertaining to Intellectual Property disputes. Further, under the CPC the Hon’ble Court has the power to allow filing of a suit under pseudonyms and to hear the matter in camera. So a civil suit was prepared claiming that ex husband of an employee had unauthorized possession of the firm’s intellectual property, was misusing it and had defamed the firm before its clients thereby causing a reputational and financial loss to the firm. Parul gladly gave a statement against her ex husband, and this was made the basis of this suit. Statements were obtained from couple of friendly clients to the effect that Parul’s husband had approached them and defamed NDA. It was decided that the suit would be filed by the Delhi office of NDA and damages in excess of Rs 2 crore will be sought, in order to make it within the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court (which had confidentiality club precedents).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The suit was filed in pseudonyms – Anuradha Vs. Bajrangi. This was no ordinary filing. NMD wanted it to be a foolproof operation. The registry was bypassed. A friendly judge in Rajiv Sahai Endlaw was identified. A couple of lawyers from NDA along with a senior counsel approached him in his chambers to bring the suit directly before him. The paperbook was handed in a sealed cover and Rajiv Sahai Endlaw admitted the suit Anuradha Vs. Bajrangi without even verification of the paperbook. The prayers to institute the suit in pseudonym and keeping the paperbook (and memo of parties) in a sealed cover were granted. Verbal prayers were made for formation of a confidentiality club, holding proceedings in camera and an ex-parte issuance of a commission to seize all the electronic devices from the residence and office of the defendant i.e. Bajrangi (Parul’s husband). The judge granted all these verbal prayers in an order that he passed in his chambers. The Commissioner and Plaintiff were also given unbridled powers during this search and seizure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The commission was executed on the very next day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nishithbhai was convinced that he could use shock and awe to intimidate Parul’s husband (henceforth referred to as ‘Bajrangi‘). Brute force was displayed during the execution of the commission, or the search and seizure operation or the raid, whatever one might call it. A massive search party entered Banjrangi’s house early in the morning at 7AM. This party comprised of several NDA personnel, cops, ‘auditors’ from PwC and the appointed Court commissioner – around 15 persons in total. Even the NDA colleagues who were part of this search team admit that the manner in which this raid was conducted was a more rough than it had to be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bajrangi’s house was ransacked and all his electronic devices we seized – even his phones. The idea was to scare the hell out of him, so that he would not dare to take on the Goliath even in his dreams. The NDA personnel who were part of the raid team directly threatened Bajrangi that if he shares the NDA’s data with anyone, then NDA would legally carpet bomb him and make his life miserable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But this had a completely opposite effect. Bajrangi, instead of being intimidated, declared to the raid team (including the Court commissioner) that he will now ensure that NDA is destroyed. Thus it turned out to be an act of stupidity by NDA – the complaints that Bajrangi and Adv Bhushan had filed with the agencies were possibly languishing, but by initiating such a coercive action, NDA had “woken up the sleeping giant”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bajrangi made an appearance in the suit through one of the top senior counsel of the Delhi High Court. He was willing to splurge money on this suit. NDA opened up some back channels to settle this matter but it could not get Bajrangi to agree with its conditions for withdrawing the suit. NDA even tried to pressurize him through the Court but he did not wilt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next was the audit of seized devices of Bajarangi as had been directed by the Court. Bajrangi was directed to be present during this exercise. He was called several times to the auditor’s office and made to remain present there for the entire day. We along with the Court commissioner tried our level best and all possible tricks to crack him, but all in vain. Not only did he possess excellent knowledge of computers, but he also had a decent understanding of law. He knew that there were limits to the powers of the Court commissioner, and he did not let us do anything in the audit exercise that was outside the scope of the Court order. Consequently, we found nothing useful for our suit during that audit exercise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NDA’s objectives from this search and seizure, in addition to intimidation, were to discover with whom all Bajrangi had already shared the data and also to destroy one particular hard disk which was the primary device on which Parul had copied all the stolen data. Unfortunately, the search party could not seize this hard disk because Bajrangi had already moved it to Adv Bhushan’s office prior to the raid. We tried to get Bajrangi to handover that hard disk to us during the audit exercise but he kept on evading our demand. We even got the Court to pass an order directing Bajrangi to handover that hard disk to the Court commissioner. He, instead of complying with that order, got that hard disk delivered through Adv Bhushan to the Supreme Court Monitored Committee for Black Money (also known as the Black Money Commission), and filed an affidavit that since the hard disk was with the Black Money Commission, he is unable to produce that hard disk. We were all stumped. Not only had we failed to get possession of the hard disk, but also now this matter was before the Black Money Commission. This was bad for the reputation of the firm and also jeopardized the clients whose confidential data was there on that hard disk. Our moves had backfired, very badly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was the time to cool down, for damage control perhaps through withdrawal of the suit. But Nishithbhai was so pissed at the audacity of Bajrangi that he instructed us to continue pressing the suit. Bajrangi responded by making several damaging counter allegations that the NDA’s objectives were to destroy evidence of tax evasion which it had abetted and to impede investigation into its wrong doings. He further alleged that this was a collusive suit between NDA and his estranged wife (i.e. Parul) against their common enemy i.e. Bajrangi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And then on the morning of July 13, 2021, a nuclear bomb was dropped on NDA and Nishithbhai. One newspaper – The Pioneer published a front page story on this suit. The story was titled India’s ‘Panama Papers’ on shell firms, tax loopholes gather dust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There were explicit details of how this suit was brought directly in the chambers of the judge, how NDA had abused the process of law by getting an ex parte order to raid the “whistleblower’s” house and tried to beat him down. It also questioned why this suit was proceeding under a confidentiality club. All in all, it made NDA the villain of the piece.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The story went on to publish the details of how the data revealed tax fraud by some of the top clients of NDA and several damaging allegations from the complaints of Adv Prashant Bhushan. It also mentioned that this data was with ED and CBDT, and they had failed to take suitable action, and now the matter had reached the Black Money Commission.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In one stroke NDA had gone from being the marquee international tax advisory firm to being compared with the tainted and now dead firm Mossack &amp; Fonseca. Nishithbhai was shell-shocked, and so was everyone else in the firm. Soon some of the clients started calling and then the media. The “Sone ki Lanka” had been burnt down.\n\nSource: [https://nishithdesaiassociates.wordpress.com](https://nishithdesaiassociates.wordpress.com)"<br />Author: 'theysai'  id: 's0gmox'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0gmox/case_study_of_why_india_needs_more_robust/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL in 2011 when top Maoist commander Cherukuri Rajkumar aka Azad in encounter, Supreme Court had stated "We cannot allow the republic killing its own children,"'<br />Body: 'Observing that it cannot allow the Republic to kill its "own children", the Supreme Court on Friday sought an "anwser" from the Centre and Andhra Pradesh government on the killings of top Maoist leader Azad and journalist Hemchandra Pandey in an alleged fake encounter.\n"We cannot allow the Republic killing its own children," a bench of justices Aftab Alam and R M Lodha said.\n\nThe court made the observation while issuing notices to the Centre and the Andhra Pradesh government on a petition filed by social activist Swami Agnivesh and Pandey\'s 30-year-old widow Babita seeking a judicial probe into the controversial killings six months ago.\n\nSeeking the replies by the Centre and the AP government to the notices within six weeks, the bench said, "We hope there will be a answer. There will be a good and convincing answer."\n\nThe petitions alleged that Azad, 58, who carried a reward of Rs 12 lakh on his head and Pandey, 32 were killed from a very close range which is evident from the post-mortem reports of both the persons.\n\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/maoist-leader-azad-encounter-republic-cannot-kill-its-own-children-supreme-court-126610-2011-01-14\n\nSupreme Court said this on basis of "fact finding report" of "rights group" CDRO whose constituent members from Kashmir are currently arrested by NIA for  collaborating with ISI &amp; acting As OGW for terrorists in Kashmir.\n\nhttps://archive.md/Fz9o3\n\nNotwithstanding Pakistan\'s efforts towards manipulating global civil society and human rights organisations into indirectly supporting secessionist movements in India, the financial trails and other digital evidence play spoilsport to its designs.\nA glaring case in point is that of Khurram Parvez who through his organisation called Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) worked as a Pakistani conduit for close to two decades, aiding in recruiting local Kashmiris as militants and financing them.\nAfter combing through heaps of incriminating evidence, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the agency responsible for probing terrorist activities in India, arrested Khurram Parvez on November 22, 2021. The arrest followed day-long search at his house and the JKCCS office in Srinagar.\nThe recoveries included anti-India propaganda materials, details about Indian Army, sensitive locations, strategic assets, visiting cards of leaders of Pak-based terrorist organisations, including Hizbul Mujahidin (HM).\nAlso read: Pak ready to host SAARC Summit, India can join virtually: FM Qureshi\nThe seizures further revealed the lead role Parvez played over the years in recruiting Indian operatives/over ground workers (OGWs) for Pak-based terrorist groups. Involvement of these operatives in espionage of Army installations, identification of potential locations for attacks in India are also being probed by the NIA. Some of these operatives were reportedly tasked to hire more associates in various states of India, including J&amp;K, West Bengal, Bihar and Delhi.\nThe investigations have exposed the rampant use of several so-called non-governmental organisations (NGOs)/ trusts for raising/receiving funds in India and abroad in the name of charitable activities and using the same for carrying out secessionist and terror activities in J&amp;K.\nOperating under the garb of a human rights champion in J&amp;K, Parvez used to prey on gullible Kashmiri youth and push them into subversive anti-India activities by providing financial incentives through these shady NGOs.\nThe modus operandi also involved several front organisations, mostly operating in violation of laws of the land. JKCCS was found to have no registration under FCRA (Foreign Channels Regulations Act) of India. This lack of regulatory oversight facilitated its access to money from abroad to aid terrorist activities.\nSeveral fake NGOs were opened under JKCCS which were used as additional avenues for receiving foreign funds and managing black money. One such organisation named Kashmiri Women\'s Initiative for Peace and Disarmament (KWIPD) did not even exist on ground.\n\nhttps://archive.md/Gk1FO'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 's0cisc'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0cisc/til_in_2011_when_top_maoist_commander_cherukuri/</li>

Subsequently, as the number of applicable Acts became numerous, and therefore unmanageable, state governments started replacing these Acts with their own, single, Act. These have been typically known as Hindu Religious &amp; Charitable Endowment Acts. Since management of religious institutions is a state subject, each state has its own version of the HR &amp; CE Act. For e.g. Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — each have their own version of the HR &amp; CE Act.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@pranasutra/the-non-severability-of-economic-financial-and-religious-practices-in-hindu-temples-c9240edea33d\n\nMosques are governed by maulanas, churches by pastors &amp; bishops, gurudwaras by akal takht &amp; temples by IAS officers.\n\nPlease tell again that Indian constitution is secular.'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 's0chqe'<br />Score:118<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s0chqe/yesterday_a_post_got_voted_to_the_top_posting/</li>

They only give out forms starting 11 am, and only give out 5 forms a day. Yes. *Only 5 forms*. You have to take a day off (or half day off, depending upon your company), travel to the post office, stand in queue and wait for 11 am, compete with tens of other folks who are waiting from before you arrived, and then when you don\'t get the form, go back and try again the next day.  \n  \nRinse. Repeat.  \n  \nHow many days can you take off like this? And then the officials are not polite or helpful. They are rude and try to shirk off their work.

My common hypothesis is it’s the influence of Mughal invaders who always wanted women to cover their heads and it sort of became normalised even in between the west and the north.'<br />Author: 'Bruhhzer'  id: 's01roz'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s01roz/is_there_a_regional_difference_between_how/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'To promote regional languages efficiently, abandon transliteration'<br />Body: 'Much has been written about the Hindi imposition debate for decades, we\'ve seen protests from speakers of regional languages, especially Tamils, against what they perceive as ethno-lingual supremacy. Proponents of this policy, in my experience, have always touted regional nationalism as their biggest obstacle. While that\'s indeed true, what\'s often overlooked is that Hindi itself isn\'t a language fully evolved and developed to *incentivise* such a policy. No one ever speaks pure Hindi anymore, the urban educated elites are especially more comfortable with English. Their pronounciations of English words are very comprehensible, clear and intelligible to native speakers. Now there are certainly loan words between various languages, however, simply writing philosophical and scientific terminologies in the Devanagiri script yields no such incentives, they might as well learn the original which is much wider in scope anyway. \n\nMost of the world transliterates words from English equivalents instead of coining new words from a given native language itself to make technical terms easier to learn by its own native speakers. The Chinese on the other hand, translate everything. Another thing they did right, coin words that will easily function as a descriptor of a given word itself. For example, "gravity" is translated to 重力, literal translation: "heaviness force". This holds true to more complex terminologies like "geniculate", 膝状体 or "knee shaped" in literal translation. Whereas we don\'t usually think "knee shaped" when we say geniculate, its the usual desi memorisation wont. And even the Japanese transliterate words like "barometer", for instance.\n\nAn NRI economist (whose name escapes me) had tweeted some time ago about his frustrations for the challenges he\'d faced in translating treatises into Hindi. To resolve this and to ensure the continued survival of regional languages, we need to develop our universities\' linguistic departments to reproduce texts - be it economics, astrophysics, biochemistry, philosophy, genetics, medicine, etc. - in regional languages, rather than merely transliterate everything from our former colonisers\' tongues. While this appears to be a peripheral issue, I\'d argue nuances such as these will really help enlighten the masses and create a native ecosystem completely independent from English - thereby rattling its hegemonic status.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?'<br />Author: 'Akashi42'  id: 'rzsbzt'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rzsbzt/to_promote_regional_languages_efficiently_abandon/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hinduism is not a religion. A sincere request to all fellow Sanatanis!'<br />Body: 'Out of ignorance most of us say something like "Hindu religion is not like Abrahamic religions". Stop!  \n\n\nUnderstand that Hinduism is not a religion. Simple! If you use the phrase religion you are doing a great disservice to our traditions which are actually based on Dharma. Now let\'s understand why it is important.  \n\n\nReligion is the corruption of natural law which is Dharma. Dharma describes the intrinsic nature of something. Religion imposes its own value system on something. Dharma is the natural way of being while religion is the commercialization of fundamental truths of being.  \n\n\nLet\'s understand the above from an example. Suppose we replace our intrinsic nature with water then how water is viewed from the perspective of both. Religion packages water and puts certain branding on it. It advertises that packaged water saying my water is purest and healthiest. It advertises a non-packaged or different brand of water is impure and will make you sick. Our experts (in the case of religion a single expert called a prophet) have tested our water and certified that it is the only brand of water that guarantees you the best health.  \n\n\nBut Dharma says there is no such thing as your water or my water. All the water is the same from the perspective of an element. It tries to understand the water. Why does it freeze and become steam in certain conditions? It tries to give you the wisdom that you can drink water from a pond, or a tap doesn\'t matter but what is important is water should be pure. If you find water is unclean it suggests various ways to make it clean and says there may be other ways too which you must learn. With ever continuing research it develops a better understanding of the nature of the water and various aspects related to it. At its core, it\'s in the eternal quest to know more about it rather than just making use of it.  \n\n\nSo by design, you can see on one hand water becomes a monopoly of a group of people while on the other hand there is no such thing and everyone is open to exploring and understanding things in the manner they find convenient. This is the way of the Sanatana Dharma and Hindu traditions in their purest form. We must acknowledge the deviations from this path and the corruptions that have occurred in our society and continue to address them. It\'s must be our most important and ultimate goal.  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nPS:  My goal here was to explain the concepts in simplest manner without trying to explain things in their entirety so please pardon any holes in whatever I have said. Subject of Dharma in itself is obviously a very big one and people have spent their lives over the centuries debating and discussing it and various nuances withing it. But I hope I haven\'t done a terrible job explaining it to someone completely uninitiated.

      <li>Title::: '[Writeup] Centre should devolve MSP procurement to states and divide the money on pro-rata basis'<br />Body: "The reason Northwest Farmers were protesting so hard was because they were fighting to retain unfair privileges they have over rest of the country.\n\nDisproportionate amount of money flows into these states from the rest of India because:\n\n\\- Their mandi system is least dysfunctional compared to rest of the country\n\n\\- Govt of India procures wheat and rice year after year and in largest volumes, discriminating against states whose geography is suited to other crops\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuge amounts of money is locked away in wheat (\\~80,000 crore per year) and rice(\\~1,00,000 crore/year) stocks, and we already having more than 3 times the mandated stock. So it is inevitable that a good part of that will rot away in storage.\n\nJust think that what could the govt do with all that money(\\~2.5 lac crore/year), instead of buying stocks and letting it rot. And how much more impact could private sector make with all the produce instead of the govt, who just buys it and stocks it.\n\nPeople say that MSP is for supporting the farmers(who are destitute and in need of support), but it is a really silly thing to say, because the system is inherently regressive(rich farmers sell more crops, get more money in this system). Direct benefits to farmer, or even a Universal Basic Income type of thing would be a better idea. \n\nBut since we can't have private sector enter, because of GOI's capitulation to Northwest farmers, least GOI can do is reduce the unfairness and inefficiency in the system. \n\nIt should allocate the money it is using for FCI to state governments on basis of population(or population+arable land). Since state governments would be more responsive to the needs to cultivators in their own states, and do more sensible procurement.\n\nGoI can meanwhile do procurement for PDS on open market(states+global market), and could even start to explore getting into cooked food (like Amma canteens in Tamilnadu).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[1\\]: [https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1697364](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1697364)\n\n\\[2\\]: [https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1740689](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1740689)\n\n\\[3\\]:[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/sufficient-food-grain-in-godowns-fci/articleshow/82150388.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/sufficient-food-grain-in-godowns-fci/articleshow/82150388.cms?from=mdr)"<br />Author: 'Silent-Entrance'  id: 'rzjvwa'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rzjvwa/writeup_centre_should_devolve_msp_procurement_to/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The horrible ground reality of outdoor defecation that plagued India for 70 years and how Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan turned the problem on its head, bringing dignity and safety to rural women – a personal perspective'<br />Body: '  \n\nFor the first 12 years of my life, I did not have a toilet inside my house. We had a row of latrines outside that a dozen houses used. Communal toilets they are called today, I think. As a child I thought toilets inside a home signified wealth, because most of the people in the small rural town I lived in, didn’t have toilets inside. \n\nWorse yet, the people poorer than us didn’t use toilets. They went to defecate outside in the open. \n\nIt was quite a culture shock to many of my city-dweller friends when I described how the rural people defecated as a daily routine. The horror in their eyes betrayed the disconnect they had from the ground realities of rural India. I remember living in the hostel and hearing my friends complain about how dirty the toilets were because a whole wing of the hostel used 8-10 toilets and I remember thinking that was a good ratio of people to toilets, and frankly, I did not feel that they were dirty, but that was me because I had lived through 12 years of using public latrines and the hostel toilets seemed posh in retrospect.\n\nI also remember the first time we built a toilet inside our house. I distinctly remember feeling that we had finally arrived in this world, that we were one of the privileged now, even rich. The round spigot instead of the square bar of metal over the tap and water, as much as I could use to flush! I remember feeling like a king. I remember cleaning my toilet to keep it spick and span, I felt proud and very possessive.\n\nLooking back now, I see how the grave the problem was for people poorer than me. Now that I am acclimatized to toilet seats and useless first world arguments about how to leave the toilet seat open, I am still reminded about how the women in my small town went about their toilet business and the juxtaposition is jarring to say the least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The etiquettes of defecating in the open for women in rural India – \n\nThere was a plot of land owned by a rich urban person who spent all his time in a gulf country. The plot was surrounded by a compound wall, a tall and sturdy one. Because of no maintenance, the plot was full of bushes and a few trees. Women used to go here for their toilet business. All the surrounding land was used by men and children.\n\nWomen would usually wake up as early as 4 AM so as to avoid crowds. They used to carry a mug of water to wash after and the younger ones would carry a small bucket. I remember women complaining to my mother how they wished they could carry a small bucket of water and how a mug was not entirely sufficient.\n\nIn partial darkness they would search for an unspoiled spot to squat. Stepping into faeces was routine. Chappals for this was hence kept separate outside homes.\n\nBusiness was conducted in utmost hurry. **Most women carried a fistful of red chilli powder hidden in the waist of their sarees in case they were ambushed in the bushes.** \n\nMany women complained of men snooping on them by peeking above the compound wall. \n\nSome more lecherous men went one step ahead and stole the mug full of water and left the women behind without any facility to wash themselves after.\n\nIn the men’s section of the ground the situation was more brutal. I had heard of buckets of water taken away by force, little boys slapped because they had somehow encroached on someone else’s territory and other horrible things.\n\nI remember talking in disgust about these recollections to my friends in college and now I realize how naïve I really was.\n\nWhat was disgusting to the now “civilized” me, was a daily reality for every rural villager every day of his life.\n\nImagine the loss of dignity for a woman who had to walk into the open to defecate. Imagine how they would have to do it during the torrential monsoon days, or during the times when they were sick, or on a day when they “did not feel like it.”\n\nIt was a human rights travesty is what it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now that we have broached the topic, I want to shift the focus somewhat a little further head to sanitation infrastructure –\n\nA new building was being constructed down the road from my house. When it was completed, they left the outlet of their sewage on the road. This was not just their wet sewage, but also the solid waste effluent from their septic tanks.\n\nOne year after all the houses in the buildings were occupied, the septic tanks started overflowing on the road. During monsoons this would look like rainwater flowing and children would stomp on the small water puddles thinking it was rain water. They did not know that they were playing in solid waste water.\n\nIn 2017, three years after 2014, we finally got gutters. And finally, all the solid waste from the building was directed into the gutters.\n\nMind you the gutters are still open. They are not concealed or closed. But open.\n\nMost small houses had septic tanks that were emptied by calling a manual scavenger. You would pay them 2000 rupees and they would empty your septic tank.\n\n**Now we have a motorized tanker that sucks out the solid waste from septic tanks, effectively eliminating the use of manual scavengers.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The effects of bad sanitation and open defecation on health –\n\nOnce a month I remember a municipal worker would come to each house in my town and give us one tablet to consume. It was a broad-spectrum de-worming pill. Pet owners will relate to this because I know how dogs have a de-worming regime nowadays where they are given pills every other month to eliminate intestinal parasites.\n\nThat’s how we used to live. Like dogs of today, kids were given de-worming medication every month, because we always had worms in our faeces. I distinctly remember my parents telling me to inform them if I saw worms in toilet. I remember it being a normal routine affair until we built a toilet inside our house.\n\nMy mother told me horror stories of worm infestations in my ancestral village where there would be no toilets and kids went through agony because of worm infestations. My cousin was literally told to squat and my uncle pulled a foot long tapeworm from his posterior. We laugh about it, but the problem is grave in rural India.\n\nParasitic infections due to inadequate sanitation progress remains one of the most ignored medical crises in the world. \n\nThere is significant Musculo-skeletal underdevelopment because of it. There is also documented underdevelopment of mental abilities because of parasitic infections. \n\nPregnant women who defecate outdoors put their developing embryo at significant risk of being born disabled because of hookworm infections.\n\nThe problems are numerous, but the solution was and still is just one – building indoor toilets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan changed the landscape in my town – \n\nIt started in 2016, not in 2014. But when it was approved, the mission moved with quick efficiency and implementation. Every locality had a shauchalaya built. This was not some plastic temporary toilet, but pucca brick and mortar structures with clean toilets segregated for men and women. \n\nThese toilets were cleaned every day with bleach. I know this because one can smell the bleach a kilometer away from these public toilets.\n\nIn 2019, funds were finally released for construction of toilets inside the household in our town. Back then they gave 10,000 rupees for every house to build a toilet.\n\nToday, almost nobody uses the public toilets because every house has a toilet inside.\n\nI have already mentioned the construction of gutters.\n\nThey have also built a water purification plant at the supply station for supplying clean water to all homes.\n\nYou should see the change in health of the townspeople. For the first time in my life, I saw them fat! Fat and soft. It was such a shocking sight because these were hardy people, and now they finally were free of diseases caused by lack of sanitation facilities.\n\nThe empty plot erstwhile used by women is still vacant and is no longer for public defecation use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The evidence of the benefits of Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan are easy to spot nationwide –\n\n**More than 600 million rural people have access to improved sanitation facilities in India.** This makes India the leader in rural sanitation in the whole world.\n\nMore than **100 million toilets have been built in villages**, giving women access to toilets and saving their dignity and maintaining their self-respect.\n\n**Rs. 50,000 crores have been spent by the government** to building these toilets. The first of a kind mission by any government in the last 75 years. This is not just villages. This means building toilets everywhere – in railway stations, public schools, petrol pumps and hospitals.\n\nMore than **300,000 deaths due to poor sanitation has been avoided** because of this mission.\n\nA whopping **58% of children have seen better nutritional absorption** after building toilets in their locality. The problems of stunted growth and wasting have been eliminated in them.\n\n**Sanitation coverage has reached 100% of all districts in India**, one way or another. This is just phase 1. In phase 2 expect even better returns in term of improved health of citizens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now that you have a perspective of how the situation on the ground was in terms of sanitation, I ask the question – why was this basic necessity denied to us for the last 60 years?\n\nI am reminded of this moment where Prince Pappu’s walnut sized brain is bewildered because cleanliness and sanitation improvement are a national policy –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Poster boy for \\\\"disconnected with reality\\\\" gang.](https://preview.redd.it/kq19ksfibla81.jpg?width=1454&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c72457b14226371314b052fe17fc8b38fe12a920)\n\nA link to the video is provided at the end of the article with the rest of the sources.\n\nIt was MK Gandhi who advocated for the eradication of manual scavenging, right? His clan ruled for the next 60 years after independence. How come it is only after 2014 that the govt began implementing the steps to eradicate manual scavenging?\n\nAnd then they have the gumption to say that the BJP is appropriating Gandhi for themselves? Gandhi’s descendants did nothing while the rural countrymen went about their toilet business in the open, becoming an international joke for all. Nothing was done at the ground level.\n\nThe tone deaf reaction of Prince Pappu proves how really disconnected they were from reality.\n\nThey scream women empowerment today, and they left rural women to defecate outside in bread daylight? Where were the champions of feminism all those 60 years? Why did Indian women have to wait for 6 decades to reclaim their dignity and self-respect?\n\nAnd they have the gumption to call Modi a fascist? For what? For empowering women by giving them toilet facilities that should have been given to them 60 years ago?\n\nWhere was the Iron Woman of India when infant mortality was at an all time high because of lack of sanitation facilities and parasitic infections?\n\nIf you want to know the reality, go to any village and ask them how their sanitation facilities were before 2014.\n\nEven today, many villages are getting their first water connections.\n\nEven today, many villages are getting their first electric connections.\n\nEven today, many villages are getting their first primary care hospitals built.\n\nEven today, ration qualities are being improved in ration stores across the country.\n\nIt’s 2022 and while the developed countries talk about self-driving cars and going to Mars, we are talking about building toilets for the poor.\n\nWhat did the governments do all these years?\n\nNothing. They did nothing. All this talk about Manmohan Singh being judged favourably by history and he did zero things for the needy in the country. \n\nWhile the villagers carried a mug full of water to wash their behinds after defecating in the open, sacrificing their self-respect, the congress party leaders filled their coffers with public money.\n\nBasic rights were denied and now they scream fascism. The true fascism happened for 60 years.\n\nHistory will judge BJP government kindly, when they finally realised that 600 million people were given toilet facilities, a pucca house under PMAY and water connections under Har Ghar Nal Jal Yojana. \n\nAsk around the villages and you will get the answer. The privileged do not know how the country suffered under the Congress yoke.\n\nI have said this before and I will say it again – Modi deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing accessibility to better sanitation facilities for 600 million people.\n\nHe will be known as a statesman par Sardar Vallabhai Patel in the future. \n\nMy obesciences to him.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources –\n\nHow outdoor defecation affected women in India-\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30727975/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30727975/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow outdoor defecation affects dignity and safety of women in villages –\n\n[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0971521518808098](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0971521518808098)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWomen subjected to disease and even violence during outdoor defecation –\n\n[https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000414](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000414)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan improved the health of women by improving sanitation –\n\n[https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/SBMG\\_Report\\_Card.pdf](https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/SBMG_Report_Card.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan reinstilled self-respect and dignity in rural women –\n\n[https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/Safety-security-and-dignity-of-women.pdf](https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/writereaddata/Portal/Images/pdf/Safety-security-and-dignity-of-women.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComplete list of improvements in health indicators in rural population after implementation of Swachh Bharat –\n\n[https://jalshakti-ddws.gov.in/sites/default/files/BMGF\\_Health\\_Impact\\_Study\\_final.pdf](https://jalshakti-ddws.gov.in/sites/default/files/BMGF_Health_Impact_Study_final.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan turned India into a global leader in rural sanitation –\n\n[https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/before-and-after-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-has-india-finally-managed-to-provide-sanitation-for-all-in-this-decade-40581/](https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/before-and-after-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-has-india-finally-managed-to-provide-sanitation-for-all-in-this-decade-40581/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow Swachh Bharat has spread awareness about manual scavenging –\n\n[https://sprf.in/swachh-bharat-mission-an-evaluation/](https://sprf.in/swachh-bharat-mission-an-evaluation/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA comprehensive data dump for the social advancements brought by Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan –\n\n[https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/study-survey.htm](https://swachhbharatmission.gov.in/SBMCMS/study-survey.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRahul Gandhi effectively laughing at the Swachh Bharat Mission -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQFX9GGPNNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQFX9GGPNNA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow parasitic infection regressed mental development in USA –\n\n[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow parasitic infection is ignored and causes millions of dollars in losses even in developed countries –\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154650/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154650/)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'rzjk8g'<br />Score:1100<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rzjk8g/the_horrible_ground_reality_of_outdoor_defecation/</li>

Essentially you've moved up the food chain and become wealthy, individualistic, often with low birth rates, double income households, live in the suburbs/white neighbourhoods and are no longer a collective votebank dependent on welfarism and community centers. You're everything the liberals hate, an economically privileged, educated non-white community essentially outdoing the whites themselves - impugning this myth of white supremacy holding down minorities. Both sides gaslight and dehumanise you as a result, but the kind of stuff that my 'liberal' colleagues say about us.... they wouldn't dare say it about other minorities like Africans or even Pakistanis, for example.

My mother, she is a tailor who worked at garments to fund our education. She is 7th grade drop out. But she wanted us to study at English medium school and that was her dreams and she worked very hard for that. Me and my brother both studied at English medium school only, but i live in banglore outter area which is not main city. Even through i studied at English medium, we never used English to communicate with each others or with our teachers.\nAfter my 10th, i was interested to take science. But my mother said she can afford to pay college fee so i eneded up taking commerce for my 11th and 12th grade.  After 12th, i took Bachelor's degree in commerce field, i had distinction marks in 12th so my college offer me low fee for my degree so i took  B.com even then i wanted to study BBA but no luck for me. After taking up commerce i really fell in love with finance and accounting.\nI follow lot of American Content, I watch lot of their movies, shows and read a looooot of their books. So my behaviour has been influenced by that.\nDuring my second year i start a my own company, i even i didn't run the company, i got notice from GST Department and Professional Tax Department. I spent 1 year roaming govt offices and paid fine around 20K to close my GST Registration. That's when I hit into the reality of India. After that i tried lot of business and failed. I had credit card, i used all my money to start different businesses, no one succeed but now I wanted to pay my due. Now I need to give my last semester examination i.e 6th sem, my mom gave my college fee money. I paid my credit card bill. \nAfter that COVID hit the India, and we have given the option to write exams on 2020 or they'll conduct exams again, i thought to write exams later. \nNow I don't have degree completion certificate and i got NO job. I have applied to 100 of companies, no one sees your resume unless you have degree. I worked at a multiple jobs there i used to earn 12k per month. After that I ended up at collection field. And No exam was conducted in 2020. In that 1 year, my gf broke up with me, and my granny expired. No job. I saw the true reality of life. And where ever I go i can see people's jealousy because I was smart then them. And I'm most of kind heart, at each step of life i see people use me even my close friends will use me to there advantage. Then I took a loan and bought a bike. I needed for travel purpose because no proper bus transportation was there for my village.\nAfter all this, i reaserched career for me. Already I have wasted my 4 years of my life. And I don't have time left to do Indian Courses. I want to make my career in the field finance like investment banking, asset management, hedge fund or private equity. Now I have a little bit of saving, and after 6 months, I'm planning to pursue CMA US (6 months short course), and after 1 or 2 years i ll do CPA US. I really don't have time to do any Indian Courses like CA or ICWA, i really don't want to do course where resulta are not guaranteed and i have my family to take care of and start to earn fast. After completing CPA i ll be 25 years old after getting some work experience i go for my MBA from a well reputed university around the world. \nIs this plan works? Or do I need to consider any other things?\n\nThis was my plan, but from past few months somthing is eating me from inside. I'm becoming more like a patriotic things. I'm feeling like if all people fly away from India, it will be like this only. No one will change the things. If very intelligent i may not be able to crack UPSC but i bet i can crack KPSC ( that is state civil servant exam). I can become a good civil servant and make some change in the society. I ll become full of emotions if I see any movies or videos about my nation. Now I'm puzzled between two. \nSometimes I feel like people don't care about anything here. And if I become civil servant, i need to work under corrupt politicians. DK Ravi an IAS officer death scares me out even today because I have seen their parents from my own eyes how they cried remembering his son.\nI have a dream to build a school for a underprivileged children. \nSometimes I feel like I just live once and i have 1 life, why i should waste it caring for people who don't care much about anything. I just need to travel the world and see the places and if i love it i ll just stay there. Border, countries are fake things built by some fucking politicians. What should I do??

      <li>Title::: 'Our Federal Agencies are underfunded and are limited by the Constitution/Law'<br />Body: "We've all seen the news how a Nuclear state's Prime Minister was stuck on a flyover for over 20 minutes, mere 10 km away from enemy nuclear country. It's a shame that the 5th largest Economy and the 4rth most powerful military's country can't even properly protect its own Prime Minister.\n\nLet's see what actually happened. On January 1-2, Special Protection Group (SPG)'s internal intelligence has sent a report to the Punjab Police on how many foreign and internal elements might target PMs rally or route. SPG asked Punjab Police to increase the security and to keep an eye out for protestors. The plan was to fly PM to Punjab then fly him again to the destination via helicopter. But since Helicopter requires high visibility, a contingency plan was also planned to go the destination via Road. SPG one day prior to the event, even conducted road rehearsals on the planned contingency route and found no problems. On the day of the event, due to bad visibility, it was decided to use the contingency route. The Punjab Police then gives green light for SPG that they are good to go. Turns out Punjab Police was sipping tea with the protestors who blocked the road.\n\nNow politics aside, Let's analyze how things could've been done in a better way.\n\nThe SPG has done a phenomenal job. They had a contingency plan ready. They had done a rehearsal drive one day prior on the same route. The only thing they did not do is have men on the ground. If SPG Agents were stationed on the contingency route, they wouldn't have had to depend on Punjab Police to know whether the route was clear or not. But then technically the SPG doesn't have the authority to clear any sort of protestors prior to the event. They can only inform the state police. I recently got to know that SPG also doesn't have any Sniper Units. They depend on State Police to provide Snipers when required.\n\nCompare this to when the US President visits India. The Secret Service airlifts their own vehicles and men a month prior to the event. They takeover the area their Prez is supposed to visit, have men placed there 24x7. They have their own Snipers watching over the area.\n\nBut then Like I said in the Title, Our Federal Agencies are underfunded and are limited by the Constitution/Law. The Secret Service's is not just a protection group like SPG, they are also a Law Enforcement Agency meaning they have all the powers of the State or Central Police. The Secret Service's Budget is $2.2 billion higher than ISRO's $1.9 billion. SPG's budget is 2.5% of that having $57 million.\n\nDon't get me started on NIA ($24 million), CBI ($110 million) and other Federal Agencies. I once used to think that India couldn't afford that amount of budget and is limited by its socialist policies. But after analyzing the budget, it seems that we spend a lot on things which are unnecessary and useless. Prasar Bharti alone got $403 million, BSNL, MTNL gets $5 billion. This Prasar Bharti even after getting so much budget can't even show a single ISRO's launch in 1080p. And this BSNL doesn't even work in most of the country and has a humongous budget. Half of it goes into salaries and pensions. You will find more such gems if you dig deep in the budget."<br />Author: 'Speed__God'  id: 'rywysu'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rywysu/our_federal_agencies_are_underfunded_and_are/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Understanding range of ignorance of religious concepts. (NOTE : I am a hindu, so I am qualified to speak only for myself, please upvote if you're in agreement)."<br />Body: 'This post is exactly what the title conveys; maligning of cultural Sanatan identity, by people who claim to be hindus themselves but don\'t believe in the "highly discriminatory" practices and preachings of Sanatan Dharma. (100% \nFrom personal experience).\n\n\n#Argument1\n\nWhen they say :  "*oh i am a hindu, but i don\'t follow regressive preachings by the people who existed thousands of years ago*",  just very calmly ask them what was the last scripture they read in order to come to this conclusion. Do they know sanskrit really well? If yes, can they decipher a random shloka if you give them one?\n\n\nAt most, they\'ll announce :  "*oh! to read the scriptures you don\'t need to know it\'s language*" and will cite Max muller\'s or some random Devdutt patnaik\'s interpretations, just know Max bhai was a british commissioned official, and devdutt patniak thinks that \'Brahm\' is \'Brahma\' (you must know that sanskrit has many words that do not have substitute words in most languages). \n\nLOOK OUT FOR A PERSON\'S EXHIBITED BELIEFS BEFORE BLATANTLY TRUSTING ANYONE.\n\n\n\n#Argument 2:\n "Science is everything, religion is equal to an intoxicant creating nothing but misery and divisions", when this argument comes up you know it\'s straight out of Das Kapital (i.e. indirectly/directly influenced by Karl bhaiya).\n\n\n#*Plus, you don\'t compare different fields on the same parameters*.\n\n\n\n\n#Argument 3:\n "*people like you believe in hindutva, hinduism doesn\'t preach violence*"\n\n- Now you can be relieved, as this confirms that they\'ve neither read the any Purana nor the Bhagwad Gita. \n\n\nNor do they know basic hindi to realize;  hindutva is just an attribute of a hindu person ("hindu" = believer of Sanatan (initially based on a geographical appropriation), "tattva" (from sanskrit) = the quality or the essence of something or a part of it), therefore furthur explaining their  justification (not their fault if they have low IQ by birth).\n\n\n\n#Argument 4:\n "*you have a discriminatory caste system*"\n\n- Caste?! What caste?! We have the \'Varna\' system differentiating amongst people by the \'guna\' they exhibit.\n\nIt\'s not even by birth (as stated by the concept of a "dwij" or "twice born" in Manusmriti).\n\n- Furthurmore caste is a portugese origin word equating to \'jaati\' in hindi (meaning a collective group like; you might\'ve heard in pop culture references of \'mard jaat\' or \'aurat jaat\', or the word \'pra-jaati\' meaning a \'sub-group\',etc.)\n\nDon\'t come to argue based on your google translation search results (which btw shows "haken =hooked" and "kreuz = cross", compounded as - "swastika").\n\n\nThanks for patiently bearing with me till here, I hope at least a majority of your misconceptions have been rectified.

      <li>Title::: 'Simple Analysis of Bharat Economy and Policies.'<br />Body: "*The information in the post has been extracted from the Reserve Bank of India and the National Statistics Office.* \n\nEver since Shri Narendra Modi government has come into power since 2014, legitimate questions have been raised ever since he and his government took power since 2014. Before that, let’s understand India’s economy and its strengths.\n\n**Bharat**\n\nOur economy is made up of many sectors. Agriculture makes a bulk of it. Thereafter, manufacturing, construction, trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication &amp; Services related to Broadcasting, Financial, Real Estate &amp; Professional Services and Public Administration, Defence &amp; Other Services form up the remaining.\n\nIndia is the hub for pharmaceutical, IT, finance, and many others. \n\nLet’s look at the each of the respective indicators.\n\n**GVA (Gross Valued Added)**\n\nThe GVA has improved for the 2021-22 (FE) by 8.6% from 1,24,53,430 to 1,35,22,461. Our exports are slowly improving at the same time. \n\n[https://tradestat.commerce.gov.in/eidb/ecnt.asp](https://tradestat.commerce.gov.in/eidb/ecnt.asp)\n\nAccording to the statistics by Govt Of India, the highest exports was to USA, Singapore, Bangladesh.\n\nIt is not going to be surprising if the export is the IT services to the USA.\n\nHence, besides semiconductor, we need to explore further on what sectors do we need for India. What we can have is having a industrial site in every rural area where companies from international companies can come and offer jobs to allow the export of textiles.\n\nWe need to do more in exporting. Like I mentioned, people's will is important. Make In India can be successful if citizens are involved in entrepreneurship and active in pursing the policies. \n\n**Per Capita Net State Domestic Product**\n\nThe per capita net state domestic product has increased tremendously. If we use 2011-12 as a base, few particular states have stood out.\n\nFrom 48499 in 2011-12 to 79203 in 2020-21, this is pretty good and constant improvement for Odisha. From 259444 in 2011-12 to 370455 in 2020-21, Goa has seen a massive improvement. Many others have seen an improvement.\n\n**Gross State Domestic Product**\n\nAnother indicator , gross state domestic product has seen significant improvement for many states. Let’s look at the following states:\n\n  \n\n|State/UT|2011-12|2019-20|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n| Delhi |34,379,750| 61,384,270|\n| Maharashtra |128,036,944| 213,406,502|\n| Odisha | 23,098,708| 41,237,480|\n| Tamil Nadu | 75,148,576| 127,855,872|\n| Uttar Pradesh| 72,405,044| 116,681,747|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia has a unique system where the centre and state have to work hand in hand. PM Modi’s policies like Make in India, Atmanirbhar bharat and encouraging entrepreneurship have impact for sure. Odisha has also implemented a similar move where they have “Invest Odisha” initiative. ([https://investodisha.gov.in/](https://investodisha.gov.in/))  It takes two hands to clap. Likewise, the centre should work with states to ensure that both propel India to greater heights. \n\nBesides policies, security, safety of investment is also important. Ever since Yogi Adityanath has been the CM, UP has seen a massive increase in the State Domestic Product. To ensure economy is functioning well, the security and safety of the country is important. That way investors can rest assured that things will go well and their investments would not fail.\n\nHowever, there have certain instances India has missed the train to grab opportunities due to internal idiots.\n\nLook at this: [https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/apr/20/korean-steel-giant-evinces-fresh-interest-to-set-upplant-in-odisha-2292296.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/apr/20/korean-steel-giant-evinces-fresh-interest-to-set-upplant-in-odisha-2292296.html)\n\nPOSCO wants to invest in Odisha yet the internal forces within the state are stopping it .\n\nThe other is socioeconomic and infrastructure.\n\n**Socioeconomic**\n\nIndia has both urban and rural. As much urban is equipped with good infrastructure, rural is begging for good infrastructure. However, things are slowly improving for the rural areas.\n\nGood infrastructure to me are: Basic Housing Facilities, Educational Institutions for all levels, Good Healthcare system, Good Road Connectivity (All weather), Good telecom communications, Basic Water Drinking Provisions, Basic Sanitation and Cleanliness. \n\nPM Modi had many policies like Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan, Beti Padhao Beti Bachao, Ayushmaan Bharat.\n\nOf course, all these are in work in progress. It can never be “completed”. It takes time for policies to work and be effective.\n\nWe need to ensure our environment is clean so that our health should not be affected. Besides, we need to ensure clinics are equipped with the basic necessities.\n\nAs for the urban, Smart Cities Mission was launched where we can see some good progress. However, some cities roads needs to be improved. (\\*Coughs\\*).\n\nOdisha Government has introduced a slew of measures albeit slowly. Bhubaneswar has a all bus system which is called MoBus and allows its citizen to cycle using the MoCycle. Moreover, BBI has a Command Centre to monitor the things in the city.\n\n([https://kalingatv.com/state/odisha-cm-inaugurates-indias-biggest-command-control-center-in-bhubaneswar/](https://kalingatv.com/state/odisha-cm-inaugurates-indias-biggest-command-control-center-in-bhubaneswar/))\n\n[https://hub.beesmart.city/city-portraits/smart-city-portrait-bhubaneswar-india#:\\~:text=Bhubaneswar%20was%20selected%20as%20one,Modi's%20flagship%20Smart%20Cities%20Mission.&amp;text=Cities%20are%20selected%20through%20the,potential%20social%20and%20economic%20impact](https://hub.beesmart.city/city-portraits/smart-city-portrait-bhubaneswar-india#:~:text=Bhubaneswar%20was%20selected%20as%20one,Modi's%20flagship%20Smart%20Cities%20Mission.&amp;text=Cities%20are%20selected%20through%20the,potential%20social%20and%20economic%20impact).\n\nEven in Gujarat and UP, electric buses are being launched in Varanasi, Lucknow and Meerut, BRTS system in Ahmedabad and a metro system in Ahmedabad and Surat.\n\nSmart Cities also needs to begin with the citizen too. Citizen should ensure that the place is functioning well and municipalities need to be proactive too.\n\nBesides, we also need to improve our highway system and also build more multi modal logistics hub. Already, Delhi - Mumbai Expressway is in progress where multi modal logistics park will be built and the expresssway will be connected to key ports like the  Mundra Port, JN Port and Jewar International Airport.\n\nEven new expressways in UP have lands allocated next to the expressways to build these parks.\n\n[https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1786527](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1786527) \\- You can have a look where NHAI is already planning but we need more in every state.\n\nEvery state should have one every 100km at least. We should have a rule mandating that every state should be have at least more than 3 international airports so that we can have more good exporting to the outside world.\n\nWhile PLIs help the Govt of India to gather companies who are interested in investing and building the necessary buildings, there should be a monitoring process to ensure the investments are done in a timely manner. Right now, we are at $3.1 trillion ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-is-now-a-3-1-trillion-economy/articleshow/88761957.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-is-now-a-3-1-trillion-economy/articleshow/88761957.cms)) But we need to do more. We have the potential to hit $30 trillion even.\n\nIn every economics lesson, few things matter. One is Labour. These make up the workforce. \n\nFor our labour force, we need to ensure the labour is educated and equipped with basic knowledge and speaking. One issue that India is facing is the imbalance of boys and girls literacy ratio. Girls too can contribute to the economy. I am thankful for the Modi Government for raising the legal age to 21. If more girls are aware of this then it can be good for the economy. \n\nWhat is surprising is that based on the statistics , the enrolment ratio decreases when it comes to higher secondary. 51.4% were enrolled in Class 11-12. It could imply more people are heading towards attaining a polytechnic diploma. \n\nHence, it is important to ensure we build and improve education system over time. \n\nSo to improve economy, we need to ensure there are centres where workers can improve their skills and learn new skills so that they can still relevant to the economy."<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'rypxwk'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rypxwk/simple_analysis_of_bharat_economy_and_policies/</li>

      <li>Title::: "New Age 'religion' damages the cultures from which it takes."<br />Body: ' This likely applies primarily to Americans who may not know that New Age beliefs are misappropriated and often misconstrued dogmas of various cultures.\n\nDisclaimer: If you do not already know, New Age is different from Neo-Pagan as neo-pagans are actively attempting to reconstruct and bring back the practices of often disheveled (often due to colonialism) traditions from down their ancestral lines.\n\nI want to talk about how New Age \'religion\' appropriates from other cultures and how it damages them.\n\nNew Age people tend to take various snippets from several cultures, blend them together, base their religious beliefs off of feelings and these tiny snippets of various cultures and claim they have it all figured out. This in particular would be fine in itself, though eccentric, if it were not or the fact that New Age people take priority over those who practice the religion in which they take from.\n\nFor example, a lot of new age people love to talk about chakras or are into yoga. Yet, very few of them actually know what a chakra or yoga is, in the context from which thy came from Hinduism. New Agers often spout that anyone can have knowledge of the chakras or yoga, when in Hinduism these topics must be learned from a qualified teacher. Thus, the information new Agers \'know\' about these topics is often half the story, incoherent, and downright wrong. When a practitioner of Hinduism points out the information the New Ager is giving is false, the New Ager often replies with something like \'well so and so (non-Hindu, New-Age teacher\' said this so it must b true. And false information spread further, especially in the West. This causes cultural erasure because young Hindus get ahold of this New Age information (due to the age of technology) and the tradition gets meddled over a period of time. Helping preserve Hinduism for Hindu youth includes destigmatizing Hinduism and uprooting the \'New Age\' or "spiritual but not religious\' appropriation of Hindu concepts and practices. Additionally, the image of the New Agers in society plants a negative impression of actual Hindus in the minds of non-Hindus and non-New-Agers as they equate New Age nonsense into actual Hindu practices and beliefs, which is not the case.\n\nThere is a lot more detail I could go into this topic as a Hindu myself, but it is so tiring to see New Agers take credit, misconstrue, sell false information, and tarnish my religion because they simply want to or are ignorant of the fact they are doing so.\n\nAdditionally, in no way am I saying New-Agers should not learn about chakras or yoga. This is an effort for decolonization. Appropriative actions harm Hindus. Appropriation is different from appreciation. I am saying New Agers should learn from a qualified Hindu teacher; that is appreciation. Then, promote authentic knowledge and refer people to the source of said knowledge; that is also appreciation. Do not take credit for the knowledge or tradition saying the \'universe\' gave it to you when a Hindu guru spent thousands of lifetimes attaining this knowledge only for you to hear about a portion of it, whether from the guru themselves or some third-party New Age teacher who took it from Hinduism themselves.\n\nAnd yes, because I get questioned this a lot, which is mind boggling, CHAKRAS AND YOGA came from Hinduism! They are in our sacred texts. There may have been any number of \'similar\' practices found in other cultures, but those culture\'s/religion\'s \'energy centers\' or \'pilates poses\' are NOT equal to our concepts of chakras and yoga, no matter how similar they seem. (Perhaps more people would know this if they thoroughly studied the concepts of those various cultures/religions, from teachers of those cultures/religions, and ours before equating them and erasing the differences).\n\nFor more information, if you are interested, you can learn about this and more from these Hindu authors:\n\nRajiv Malholtra\'s U-Turn Theory:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6QGe-a8gM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6QGe-a8gM)\n\n(he also runs the Infinity foundation and I believe his U-Turn Theory book is available on there)\n\nSanskriti Deva\'s article:\n\n[https://sanskriti-deva.medium.com/](https://sanskriti-deva.medium.com/)'<br />Author: 'Turbulent-Rip-5370'  id: 'ryeze9'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ryeze9/new_age_religion_damages_the_cultures_from_which/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'From the Archives: When the brute majority of traffic to the self declared official subreddit of India was found to be of foreign origins.'<br />Body: ' The following is an old post from 4 years ago republished in Public Interest. Minor corrections have been made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"Hey Everyone,\n\nLet me begin with a TL;DR:\n\n&gt;Quick Summary: Approximately \\[Indians vs Rest of the World\\] interacting with r/ India is \\[25%:75%\\]. Out of approx., 200k interactions (This number fluctuates, but %ages are somewhat constant +/- 10ish) of reddit users with r/ India, only about 50k (+/- 10%) originates from India. The rest 150k+ is from outside (93k: US, 18k: UK, Russia: Negligible, etc.). This means, "r/ India is not a subreddit of Indians. It is a sub highlighting what users from rest of the world talk about India; with actual Indians being a mere minority." This calls to question any political or domestic topic discussion(s) held, as 3 out of 4 people commenting probably aren\'t even in India, to give opinions accurately and honestly. It also throws great clarity on why there is more anti-India news peddled on it?\n\n**A few important disclaimers:**\n\n&gt;This information does not violate any privacy rules, afaik, as no body\'s individual data was used. The data used to frame this report is available online via reddit via reddit ads page. Meaning Reddit by itself makes it open to everyone (except it is in the last place one would look). The interpretations and conclusions drawn from this does not jeopardize privacy of an individual. The data thus acquired should be more or less similar if accessed via websites that study internet-website traffic data.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Special thanks to [/u/PassionateIndophilia](https://new.reddit.com/u/PassionateIndophilia/) for this discovery. I worked on the data after I got to know of it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. In the spirit of honesty, I would like to declare my/our conflict of interest: The Data is quite accurate and inferences as unbiased as possible. I also clearly mention in relevant places where the report is at best a subjective inference, as data would be insufficient to make a conclusive opinion. Also, I am currently a mod of [r/IndiaSpeaks](https://new.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/) and my priority is the sub over any other. At the same time, I do not have any ill will, or intentions on topics I write about.\n\n1. Intro and Background\n\nAs most of you are aware, [r/IndiaSpeaks](https://new.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/) has had a few sponsored ads on reddit this past week, with a little help. What we thought at first would be something straight forward revealed something so eye-opening, it took me a while a wrap my head around it. It all started with the above user felt there was a glitch in the reddit ads pages. After investigating a little, it dawned on me that it was no glitch, because data does not lie - our assumptions previously were deluding us.\n\nWhen one goes on the reddit advertising page, and tries to start a ad campaign for their product/service/etc (for any reason): The 2nd step is to choose your target audience - which is broadly classified into 3 categories - "Country", "Interests", "Subreddit". Seems fair, If you are advertising for \\* desi dantmanjan\\*, you will want the ad to be somewhat relevant to the users, right? You don\'t want to advertise it in the UK, where you don\'t even have a supply chain.\n\nOne can also add \'exclude\' criteria for \'country\' and \'subreddit\' - if you don\'t want ads to be shown in certain countries/subs. Like you don\'t want to advertise about cricket in the sub [r/cricket](https://new.reddit.com/r/cricket/), cos it is a waste of views/clicks)\n\nThis "Define Audience" section also reveals approximate audience for that ad. If all categories are kept empty - the ad would run world wide, for over 36 mil viewers (Full reddit traffic).\n\nDue to the nature of our ad campaign, we were trying to work out the appropriate audience, and there is where we discovered what was hidden in plain sight.\n\nThe reddit website measures user/netizen activity in **\'interactions\'**: this can be subscribers, recently visited a particular sub, talked/viewed a particular topic, upvoted/downvoted, commented, etc.\n\nWe (and you too) defined a particular set(s) of audience to see numbers we can/will target.\n\n1. Target audience: country - India\n\n* The number of Indians (from Indian geography/IP address) who interact on reddit is around 260,000.\n\n1. Add target audience: Subreddit - r/ India\n\n* The number of \'interactions\' on r/ India is around 205,000. (Seems right? No? Something fishy?).\n* The number of Indians (Geography/IP) who interact with r/ India is about 50k +/- 10% (Wait, what? Doesn\'t make sense?)\n\n1. If you add an exclusion: Exclude country: India; Target subreddit - r/ India. (This means, Show ads on r/ India, but not to Indians (By Geography/IP)\n\n* The number of \'interactions\' possible is over 150k. (Are you Stumped yet? Does not make sense?)\n\n&gt;**The above few statements mean:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(1) While the numbers of Indian interactions on reddit is over 260k, and number of interactions on r/ India is around 205k - the number of Indian interactions on r/ India is only about 50k.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) out of the over 205k interactions on r/ india, 150k are foreign ones. Meaning 3 out of 4 people voting, commenting, viewing, etc are not even from within India.\n\nSo I investigated further.\n\n4) Exclude: India (country). Target audience: US (Country), r/ india.\n\n* Interactions on r/ India from the US was over 93,000.\n\n1. Similarly,\n\n* Interactions on r/ India from the UK: 18k, Australia, 8k, Russia (Negligible), and so on altogether making up 150k+.\n\nPlease refer to this chart made to warp your head better. [https://imgur.com/a/kM8g1o7](https://imgur.com/a/kM8g1o7)\n\nI have also put a few other countries\' traffic for you to compare. All the data is available in the locations above, so anyone can recreate similar graphs at any time.\n\n2. FAQs: Now you may ask\n\n* Even I visit regional subreddits of other countries, so wouldn\'t that inflate the numbers?\n\n**Ans:** True, even I do. But do we visit everyday? how much do we even understand or interact with other national subs? These numbers are **Daily figures**. Not a cumulative. I checked these numbers over a few days/a week and there is a swing of 10% but it still stays. I Acknowledge international traffic will be there, but in a normal situation one can give a round figure. This figure usually does not overshadow actual country\'s netizens talking about their country.\n\nDefinitely, if international traffic are constantly higher than domestic traffic, something else is going on entirely.\n\n* Does that even matter? Reddit is open to all so anyone can be anywhere!\n\n**Ans:** Traffic shouldn\'t matter in subs like [r/Aww](https://new.reddit.com/r/Aww/), [r/gifs](https://new.reddit.com/r/gifs/), etc. In a subreddit dedicated to a country, one would imagine majority traffic would be of that country, and small minority would include expats, people interested in the country, foreign observers, etc. Do note that in most national subs, politics is the mainly discussed. While respected, the opinions of those who are not even living in that country (about intricate domestic details) is less relevant. Yet if 3 out of 4 people who are giving opinions, are not even living in the country. Even if expats do give their opinions about assembly elections, regional policies, etc do these matter?\n\nSince most of us did not know of this, we assumed these are real Indians living in India opinions - Data proves otherwise.\n\n* Why would people who don\'t even live in India act as Indian resident and curate content in a sub?\n\n**Ans:** While your guess is good as mine, I do not have any data to make a claim on this. I can only give theories, but they are subjective.\n\n* Is it possible that only the Indians are submitting links, voting, commenting while others are only observing?\n\n**Ans:** There is nothing that proves or disproves the above statement. The best conservative assumption would be, the ratio of lurkers, voters, commenters, etc are same within India as much as outside. Even then it is 25%:75%.\n\n* So, basically you\'re telling me, in the so-called country subreddit of India; Domestic Indians are a minority. The majority community is foreign and is curating content on the sub - including opinions, predictions, \'ground level stats\', opinions on politics, policy, economics, etc.\n\nAns: **Yes. I am - based on irrefutable data. You can go to the Reddit Ads page and under "Define audience" sub section, Play around with location &amp; Subreddits - you will get 100% legit data from the admins/site itself.**\n\n* Do the mods know this? Is this why r/ India mirrors a lot like [r/worldnews](https://new.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) comment section on India related news?\n\n**Ans:** Don\'t know if the mods know, if they do and are silent about it - it is even more messed up. Possibly yes with respect to to mirroring.\n\n* Is there anything mods can do to hide this data? Can mods complain and remove this data?\n\n**Ans:** Nope - these are mandatory advertisement related data that reddit admins give out to interested (in reddit ads) parties. No sub mod has control over it. Faking/changing it would mean reddit team is trying to fudge/hide real information - which they will never do in any case - that would be violating advertiser\'s trust/money.\n\nSo basically, this data is always current, daily updated, and server generated.\n\n* Why is it relevant again?\n\n**Ans:** In any political, regional or subject wise discussion sub - opinions hold some truth if they are actually relevant to the subject. Sure, opinions of non-relevant parties can be heard, but they are and must be of lower priority. Else it is borderline subverting democratic rights on that topic.\n\nFor example, an artist\'s opinion in a group of scientists would be heard and respected. But Scientific opinion on everything science by a group of artists (3/4th of a group in this case) masqurading as scientists is only false, misleading, bullshit, irrelevant, and screwed up in everyway possible.\n\nIts like the Indian parliament is filled with 50% US residents another 25% from other countries and only 25% of Indians alone. Do you think they would have realistic idea(s) of what are right decisions and what are realities on the ground?\n\n* Why have you brought it up?\n\n**Ans:** Upon this discovery, we also checked the traffic of our sub and will make this data public in the spirit of transparency. We are [r/IndiaSpeaks](https://new.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/) feel it is quite vital for the community to know this. We will also reveal our traffic data, and keep it updated every few months.\n\n[**To that effect, Click Here for /r/IndiaSpeaks traffic data**](https://imgur.com/a/DK5hZhF)\n\nLike mentioned above, a fixed whole figure will always jaywalk and linger in such political/subject wise subs. Besides no subreddit can prevent who accesses it, but since discussions are political and Indian-centric, it is vital to let the community know this information. What they do with this information is secondary.\n\nAdditionally, as some of you are aware, we are holding a demographic survey of [r/IndiaSpeaks](https://new.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/). We will now be corelating that data along with this one. If the demographic survey is indifferent or negatively co-relating to this traffic data, then we would have to toss that survey results due to incorrect sampling/troll answers.\n\n**While it is not my place, We believe all politically active India verse subs must do this exercise and present data, if they have a transparency policy. I would go further to urge subreddits of other countries as well to do this background work, but at the end its their choice.**\n\n3. Theories and Inferences:\n\nNow being from science, I despise commenting like a humanities graduate and making assumptions. Please note that this section is subjective with claims/assumptions based on extrapolated data. Proceed on this section with that understanding that you can accept or reject partially or fully. Regardless, it would still talk about real possibilities. Yet, this is mainly on circumstantial evidences, anecdotal or similar knowledge.\n\n* It is highly likely that a lot of these non-domestic interactions with [r/India](https://new.reddit.com/r/India/) are Indian expats. Most Indian expats are renowned for **Aggravated MisoIndica** (Basically Indians or ethnic Indians living abroad who hate India with a patriotic fervor of a thousand suns). The dedication with which Indian expats opine against India, would make you believe that it would help them get foreign citizenship. At the same time, I have not come across any such India-hating-ethnic-Indians who would dedicatedly spew venom even after leaving the country. Sure, they hate the country, but once they leave, they are more busy minding their own business, trying to get their PR/Citizenship, etc rather than rant full time online. But it cannot be ruled out.\n* There is also a possibility that foreigners who are aware of India a little plus google are just masquerading as Indians for lols and vicarious pleasure, like the regulars of world news. Again, if you are never going to visit India, and India is never considered a threat to any western country, only an absolute idiot would go this far. Taking frequent dumps on worldnews makes more sense than pitching a tent in r/ India. But it cannot be ruled out.\n* Could it be Pakistani/Bangladeshi expat in developed countries? Highly unlikely, they\'d rather mind their own business with occasional trolling. Even if they could be, it would a very small number. It can be ruled out from having major influence/numbers.\n* It could be a tech shilling company like \'Cambridge Analytica\' trying to subvert narrative and to influence Indian elections/narrative. But it would be pretty lame company if true, because it is commonly understood that reddit in India is quite irrelevant, with its reach and predictions worth a naught. If its a tech company, they would have at least done this much homework before spending resources wastefully. But it cannot be ruled out.\n* (Added point) A small number may also be contributed by Use of corporate VPNs by IT coolies, during their idle times. While I previously considered this as an insignificant amount, the fact that India is a services capital - I would have to add this, considering this may contribute slightly for "Geographic Indians being read as Western IP" by reddit. Again, I would still think this would be a small number - but might be enough to show a blip on the radar.\n* There may be a link between their mods curating anti-Indian content and the community continuing to consume it.\n* As of this discovery, it would now be inaccurate to assume r/ India is filled with Indian left and/or Indian liberals, etc. Clearly, if they are India-living-leftists, they are much smaller minority in their own supposed bastion (because they\'d at best form a sub-set of the 50k interactions). Regardless, their voices get support not because other \'Indians from India\' agree with them.\n\nAt this point, we can guess all of the above and some other unknown reasons contributing in varying degrees. It would not be accurate to guess which influences more or less.\n\n4. Conclusion, What we can be sure of?\n\n* r/ India is not even Indian - but falsely makes one assume it. Any Indians who get their information from here to make their electoral, political or otherwise opinions about India need to be cautioned. A more accurate description would be "a Sub where the world talks about India, and Indians are just observers", or "25%:75%" for short.\n* Previously it was speculated and assumed \'too Many NRIs\', \'no handle on ground realities\', \'no idea about reality\', \'echo chamber\', \'anti-India\' etc. Now a lot of these points are mostly true, but not necessarily because they are deluded Indians, but because they not residents of India.\n* Any AMA guest or political/public event (Such as Aadhaar related, etc) is actually talking to a completely different audience than who they were promised. And more importantly - a mostly irrelevant audience.\n* Should people make epic memes about this discovery? Yes. of course. You would have betrayed the nation/world if you miss this opportunity. If you don\'t make memes, change your name, cos ain\'t a real Indian meme factory.\n* The Impact of the sub and reddit as such is much smaller than imagined wrt India.\n* Indians on reddit need to be informed about this, and be given hope. You only have such nefarious intent and impose spiraling despair on your enemies. Our own country men, even if they dont agree with our political, cultural, etc opinions, must be cautioned. For an electoral opinion/decision based on this is more devastating than a petty reddit squabble.\n* If they (those Indians who disagree with you) continue to go to the sub even after knowing this, that is completely their choice and freedom. Respect that choice and move on.\n* I also would like to advise every country sub, political discourse, or such avenues creating partisanship or conflicting opinions at the very least - to do the due diligence and be transparent about who is giving opinions.

      <li>Title::: "'I never felt I was 'somebody'' - Saurabh Shukla | Interview (2017)"<br />Body: "*The hugely talented Saurabh Shukla speaks to Rediff.com's Patcy N about his life and 30-year career in cinema.*\n\n\n#'After spending many years in theatre, I still did not have enough money'\n\nMy parents are musicians. My father was the head of department of music and fine arts at Delhi University. My mother was the first lady tabla player. I have an elder brother, who lives in Botswana, southern Africa. He is a commerce teacher but he's also into music.\n\nMaybe because there was an overdose of music, I wanted to do something different from a young age. That's why I became an actor. We used to watch a lot of movies and I was very inspired by them. I think I got the germ of filmmaking when I was in Standard 6 or 7. I didn't even know what direction was, but I wanted to make films.\n\nMy parents wanted me to find my own path, but at the same time, complete my basic education. I didn't tell them I wanted to do films, but I started writing because to make a film, you needed a story. For many years I couldn't write beyond 6 to 8 lines, but they would read and appreciate whatever I wrote. They thought that if you want to become someone, you should try out everything. When I was in Standard 9 and 10, I was inclined towards sports. They encouraged me for that too. Then I started playing table tennis, which I do even today. When I went to college and started doing theatre, I told them for the first time seriously that I wanted to do theatre.\n\nIn 1984, I started doing plays professionally. I went to Mandi House and joined a group called Sakshi. I was with them till 1991. We used to do classics then like Arthur Miller's *A View From The Bridge*, John Osborne's *Look Back in Anger*, Vijay Tendulkar's *Ghashiram Kotwal* and Girish Karnad's *Hayvadan*. I used to do these plays in Hindi. Later, I started dong plays like *2 To Tango 3 To Jive* in Hindi and English.\n\nAfter spending many years in theatre, I still did not have enough money. I was 28 then and had to settle down.\n\nThe year I joined the Repertory Company, a professional wing of NSD (the National School of Drama) was an important one because (the legendary stage director) Ebrahim Alkazi was coming back after 14 years. Everybody, including me, was very excited. I worked there as an artiste for two years.\n\n#'Bandit Queen was a dream project'\n\nSeema Biswas was my colleague at the Repertory Company. She got selected for Shekhar Kapur's *Bandit Queen*.\n\nShekhar saw me and liked me. During that time, I got selected for a BBC project for which I had to go to London. I had also got an offer for Bernardo Bertolucci's *The Little Buddha*. Shekhar wanted to cast me in *Bandit Queen*, but since I was going to London, it ended there.\n\nSomehow, the BBC project got shelved and I wasn't selected for the film either. Suddenly, I was out of work. I felt sad because all my friends were doing *Bandit Queen*.\n\nBefore Shekhar left to shoot *Bandit Queen*, he came to watch a play, *Khabsoorat Bahu* in which Seema was the main actor. I used to open that play and had a couple of parts too. He called me backstage and kept looking at me and shaking his head. Then he left. I didn't understand what was going on. Shekhar must have realised that my BBC project had not worked out. \n\nThe next thing I realised was that Tigmanshu Dhulia, who was his assistant at that time, gave me a ticket saying Shekhar wanted me to go to Dholpur (in Rajasthan). I reached there and there was still one month to go before the shoot started. I asked Kannan Iyer, who was the chief assistant director, what my role was. He said only five of those who were called were actors, so I very happy.\n\n*Bandit Queen* was a dream project. I learnt a lot from Shekhar Kapur. He was my first film director and a very good one. My only regret is that I just got to do one film with him because after that he went abroad to make films.\n\n**Shekhar has a very good vision when he incorporates a scene.**\n\nThere was a scene in the climax where Phoolan Devi (played by Seema Biswas) is running away from the police. She is my cousin and I have always been in love with her even though she is my sister and even though I'm married with a kid. So in the climax, she is running through the desert and is thirsty. She lies down and I get water for her.\n\nPhoolan asks me: *'Bandook laya? (Have you brought the gun?)'*\n\nI say: *'Main paani leke aaya (I have brought water)'*\n\nPhoolan: *'Mera gang kahan hai? (Where is my gang?)'*\n\nMe: *'Sab mar gaye. Tu bhi marjayegi, jaa surrender kar le (Everyone is dead. They will kill you too. Go, surrender).'*\n\nNow this was a serious scene. When Shekhar asked us to rehearse, we did it many times, but he was not satisfied. Then he asked us to say our dialogues with a smile. Seema and I were shocked. He explained that our relationship is different even though I am her cousin. I was in love with her, and she knew it. In love, the only thing you remember is smiles.\n\nPhoolan is trying to remind you that she is the same girl that you are in love with and I am smiling because I am trying to tell her I remember everything and it will not change anything. So we did the scene with a smile and that created another layer in the film.\n\nAfter *Bandit Queen*, Shekhar asked me if I preferred films or theatre. I said I preferred films, but that I wanted to direct.\n\n#'I had become a household name with Tehkikat'\n\nShekhar called me again during the Repertory Company's 15-day annual festival. He told me he had work for me, but asked me to leave the next day. I could not leave immediately, as all the plays would collapse without me. I was heartbroken after the festival because I was jobless.\n\nSuddenly, my telephone rang and it was Shekhar, asking me to come to Mumbai for the shooting that had gotten delayed. I came to the city to do a serial called *Tehkikat* for Doordarshan. It was a crime drama, along with Goldie saab (Vijay Anand, the legendary director and Shekhar Kapur's maternal uncle).\n\nThe first two episodes were directed by Shekhar Kapur and was produced by Karan Razdan. After Shekhar left, Karan directed the other episodes. Four episodes were directed by Goldie saab. I did two seasons, both of 50 and 75 episodes. \n\nI was a huge fan of Goldie saab; I got to spend so much time with him. He would tell me stories and anecdotes. I learnt a lot from him. Towards the end, he was not happy with the industry because it did not support him. He was finding it difficult to make films.\n\nAfter *Tehkikat*, I returned to films. I had become a household name; that is what television does to you. After doing 125 episodes, people have seen you inside out. Sudhir (Mishra) had told me then that he found it difficult to cast me in a film.\n\n*Tehkikat* was getting over, but I was doing another series produced by Karan Razdan and one called *9 Malabar Hill*, written by me. Nowadays, one episode is shot in a day, but those days, the same thing took three days. So where would you find time to work in films?\n\nLuckily, all my series got over at the same time and I was free. That's when Sudhir fulfilled his promise and gave me *Iss Raat Ki Subah Nahin*. That was my first nomination for the Screen Awards.\n\n#'When people ask me if I struggled, I say yes. After every night, we struggled to get up in the morning!' \n\nAfter that, I played Bobby Deol's father in *Kareeb*.\n\nThe late editor Renu Saluja (*Kareeb* director Vidhu Vinod Chopra's former wife) suggested my name for *Kareeb*. Vidhu looked at me and was not sure that I would be able to pull it off. Physically, Bobby and I do not share the same frame. He is a tall Punjabi lad and I am short. So he kept checking the screen tests for almost a year. That did not frustrate me because it is a great idea to understand that you are nothing. \n\nThe day you start thinking you have done so much, it becomes a complex and nobody can help you in such a situation. I never felt I was 'somebody'. But yes, I agree I was excited to make a mark. So what if I didn't make a mark in cinema, I did it in theatre!\n\nFinance was not much of a problem those days because little jobs would come my way, like an ad or some episodes on television. Life was always a hand-to-mouth existence. We were 5, 6 friends living together - people like (Dhoom 3 director) Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tigmanshu Dhulia and Manoj Bajpayee. The rent would get divided. Somebody would buy the booze and somebody would cook. We always had a party.\n\nWhen people ask me if I struggled, I say yes. After every night, we struggled to get up in the morning!\n\n#'I have a bad memory about bad things; I forget these things'\n\nAnurag Kashyap, who was assisting Ramu (Ram Gopal Varma), called me. We didn't know each other much, but both of us were from Delhi and he knew me for my work.\n\nThough Anurag was already writing for him, Ramu felt a need for another writer. I am not a writer by heart and went to his office to refuse the job. But Ramu started the conversation saying he wanted to cast me as a particular character in the film and then he made listen to the story. I was jacked because I had to either give up both, writing and acting, or keep both. So I agreed to write. That's how I wrote the film with Anurag. Manoj Bajpayee was a friend, so it was life-changing.\n\nWhen you are writing for your own character, people think you will write it better. But that's not true. I blame my parents for raising me in a certain way. I come from a middle class family of a time when the values were slightly different from what they are today. I was taught not to talk too much about yourself or praise yourself and show off money. So whenever I have done films that I have written, I have kept my character right at the back.\n\nSo if you see *Satya*, my character Kallu Mama's entry happens just before the interval. So the actor, who is writing the film, hasn't written a scene for his character at the beginning of the film. That's what Ramu loved when he read the script for the first time. He had full faith in me. It does help me as an actor when I write the film because then I understand the whole thing.\n\nOf all the films I have done till date, even if I haven't written them, most of the directors have been kind enough to share the whole film with me. So first, I understand the whole story and then my part comes organically. That is why I am able to act the way I do.\n\nAfter *Satya* released, there were problems between Ramu and Anurag. It was a bad phase, but I don't remember any of it. I have a bad memory about bad things; I forget these things.\n \n#'I was not happy with some of my work; it was boring'\n\nAfter *Satya*, I was hit by reality because you don't make *Satya* everyday. I got fame, people started recognising me, and I started thinking every film would be like *Satya*. But that's not reality. \n\nAfter that I entered the field of commercial films. There was hierarchy and there were roles and scripts which I did not like. But still I did them. I was not happy with some of my work; it was boring. Creatively, I was very low.\n\nCommercial films have their own system, where you get more facilities, respect and money. That created a lot of confusion in me. Like, when I would get called for a big film, I would think I was getting a meaty role. But it was always the role of an uncle or a friend, which was not an important part of the story but a filler. Most of the time I did not have anything to do in a film, even though I was in it throughout. But I thank God I did those small roles! \n\nHad I refused everything after *Satya*, I wouldn't have been be here. I wouldn't be able to do a *Jolly LLB* or *Barfi!*.\n\nDuring that period, I did get disinterested in acting. I decided to direct films and was absent as an actor for some time. People thought I was not acting so they stopped giving me roles. I started getting only cameos.\n\nI started directing and writing films like *I am 24, Raat Gayi Baat Gayi* and *Pappu Can't Dance Saala..* I was not able to make my mark as a director.\n\n#'I had stopped expecting awards a long time ago'\n\nOne day, Anurag Basu contacted me and said he wanted to cast me in *Barfi!*. I was not sure about my role because it was a big film and Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were in it.\n\nI told Anurag to call me only if I had something substantial to do in it. He said he did. It was a meaty role and a wonderful film.  Suddenly, I got interested in acting again. I shot that film for a year and had great fun doing it.\n\nWhile I was doing *Barfi!*, Subhash Kapoor told me about Judge Tripathi's role in *Jolly LLB*. On paper, it was a small role, but Subhash was very clear that it was the anchor of the film. I got really inspired and did it. I got a National Award for it. I had stopped expecting awards a long time ago.\n\nWe normally see a judge only in court. But in this film, you get to know about his life too and you think that you know the judge very well. He is not just someone who says, 'Order, order,' but he is a complete human being. He needs a flat to live in. He has some physical illness. He gets headaches. He gets tired. He loves his tea. All these nuances were captured during the shoot and Subhash participated a lot in it.\n\nAkshay Kumar has done films like *Housefull* and *Rowdy Rathore*, at the same time, he has also done *Special 26, Baby, Airlift* and *Rustom*. In these films, the story is more important than anything else. The other characters also have a good role. *Jolly LLB 2* is that kind of film. The experience was similar to the first film's.\n\nAkshay never behaved like a star on the sets. I don't think he behaves like that in real life either. We were all co-actors and weren't made to feel separate.\n\n#'If you get de-motivated, it means you are losing it'\n\nMy films like *Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyu Aata Hain, Aur Devdas* and *Peter Gaya Kaam Se* are ready, but have not released yet. It obviously breaks your heart, but then, that's how life is. If you get de-motivated, it means you are losing it. It means you are bigger now.\n\n*Khosla Ka Ghosla* was released after three-and-a-half years, but it made its mark. *Paan Singh Tomar* was released after four years. *Aur Devdas* is ready and delayed, but the day it comes out, it would prove its worth.\n\nMy forthcoming films are *Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laddoo Deewana* and *Shabhash Kundu* with Kamal Haasan.\n\n**I have started doing theatre again.**\n\nWhen I started doing films, I got busy in that, but then I reached a point where I realised that if I take a break from films, people will not forget me. So after almost 18 years, I have decided to do theatre again, just for the love of it.\n\nAfter the play *2 To Tango 3 To Jive*, my second is *Barf*. It is a thriller based in Kashmir. I had written this as a film script, not for a play. But then Bharat Rang Natya Mahotsav wanted me to do a play for them and that's when I thought that this script can be adapted for a play.\n\n[Source](https://www.rediff.com/movies/report/i-never-felt-i-was-somebody/20170213.htm)"<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rxwqdf'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rxwqdf/i_never_felt_i_was_somebody_saurabh_shukla/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Can we speak about Indian Christians ?'<br />Body: 'I’m from Kerala, I was in Chennai for a cousin’s wedding, I happened to visit Marina Beach, there was this dude, who with a microphone was screaming that his Lord (Jesus ) is the true Lord, and idol worshippers are sinners, will suffer and what not. \n\nWhen I was at school (Xian school), we non Abrahmics used to attend ‘moral education’ when Xians and Muslims had their respective faiths being taught, so a guy named ‘X Narayanan’ converted to Xianity and our moral education professor Ian Taylor was like “that’s great news, hope more follow”. We were in fifth grade, the mental impact that line would have had on kids in that class, I’m sure many would be able to guess ! \n\nWhen I was in a train with my aunt, a lady came up to us and initiated a discussion, eventually she handed out a pamphlet asking us to believe in Christ, my aunt and I were traveling for a medical emergency and I can’t imagine the trauma my aunt would have gone through when the lady said all our sufferings were because we weren’t towing in line with Christ. \n\nMy ex Girlfriend who was a Xian, asked me to accept Christ, when I had no problem with her following her faith, even used to visit churches with her. I was just hoping that she would allow me to do what I want to do, I was honestly an atheist back in the day. I tried explaining that love is about respecting each other’s beliefs a concept she simply couldn’t comprehend. \n\nSome of my friends who are Xians, have utter disrespect for my faith, they don’t even see us as humans, I remember getting ‘Son of God’ blue ray back in the day to watch with some Xian friends, they ended all teary eyed by the end of it, understandably, just when I was trying to comfort one of them, I was told “He died for people like you and look at you believing in some idols”. \n\n\nMy arm chair study and some discussions I got to have with people I realized that Sunday schools run by churches basically impart that “there is only One God” anybody who doesn’t tow in line with that thought are evil/sinners. They’re destined to go to hell. Such indoctrinations at young age is probably why such hate is going aroun. \n\nHave others here gone through similar experiences or am I at the wrong place with the wrong people and probably at the wrong time. \n\nI have huge respect for Christians, my mom and I studied in a Xian school, we visit Xian churches, St Antony Kochi on Tuesday, quite famous locally yet people like us get dehumanized at almost every juncture. \n\nWhat do Christians feel about this ? I see a lot of my Xian friends on social media speak on Hindutva and RSS, I never see them call this out ? Are you guys okay with such thought processes ?'<br />Author: 'sachinsourav02'  id: 'rx85g0'<br />Score:421<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rx85g0/can_we_speak_about_indian_christians/</li>
      <li>Title::: "China's Pangong Tso Bridge can't be countered with panic or prolemic"<br />Body: "I was reading an opinion piece by Praveen Swami on ThePrint that discusses the comprises India made to China during the recent skirmishes and the gigantic gap in the infrastructure. He further argues that the Government should communicate the dilemma to the public, build a consensus on the next steps and set a long-term military policy.\n\nHere is the article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/security-code/chinas-pangong-tso-bridge-cant-be-countered-with-panic-or-polemic/795943/](https://theprint.in/opinion/security-code/chinas-pangong-tso-bridge-cant-be-countered-with-panic-or-polemic/795943/)\n\nI have shortlisted the important points for the reader's convenience. They are listed below:\n\n1. Troop disengagement in the Gogra area involved Indian troops falling back to their permanent positions at Point 17, at the confluence of the Changlung La stream and the Kugrang river. In turn, the PLA pulled back to semi-permanent positions some two kilometres north-east of the LAC. India also suspended patrolling between Point 17 and 17A.\n2. The Gogra agreement not to patrol up to Point 17A means India, for all practical purposes, now recognises China’s new claim that the LAC lies south of Point 17A, at 78°53’E,34°22’N, territory the PLA has never held.\n3. The demilitarised zone created in February 2021 between Finger 3 and 8 lies in territory which China has acknowledged, in formal negotiations, to lie on the Indian side of the LAC.\n4. Any disengagement in the Depsang Plains, similarly, will likely involve the painful decision to give up patrolling to the arc from Point 10 to Point 13, in return for China pulling back troop positions that have built up east of the Indian post at Burtse—effectively giving up the right to physical assertion of the LAC.\n5. There is a giant gap in spending — $178 billion is committed to the Chinese military compared with some $47 billion by India. In addition, China has invested giant sums in fixed asset creation in Tibet. In 2019 alone, it spent some $9.9 billion on roads, railways and fibre-optic lines. The PLA has all-weather road access to the 31-odd major passes across the LAC.\n6. Last week, news broke that the PLA is building a bridge across Pangong Tso, linking its base at Sirijap to the south bank of the lake. The bridge will drastically reduce the distance the PLA needs to traverse to reinforce its positions south of Pangong, an area where Indian troops have traditionally enjoyed a tactical advantage.\n\nI keep reading that there's been no loss and then another article writes that certain tiny pieces of grey area have been compromised. **Read and opine (counter Praveen's arguments that do not hold water, if at all there's any).**"<br />Author: 'amswy'  id: 'rx7f2x'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rx7f2x/chinas_pangong_tso_bridge_cant_be_countered_with/</li>

The country also faces trade deficits with nearly all of its major trading partners like China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia etc. The US and UK are the only 2 major trading partners that India doesn't record a deficit with. In fact, I believe it was the primary reason why India refused to join the RCEP free trade agreement, for fear of the Indian market being flooded with Chinese goods. \n\nFrom what I have read online, it seems that while India imports alot of goods and services, it doesn't really export much at all. Why is it that a country as large as India doesn't have the capability to export a high quantity of goods and services? Is it because no other country wants India's goods and services?

As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/17/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**—2.3. Work experience—**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n*In the 160th year of Magadha hegemony*\n\n*(332 BC)*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n“One final thing, prince,” said Devajit, still bowed before Pabbata in salute, “Our spies have been on the lookout for Chanakya as you directed, and I believe there is cause for you to worry about his loyalty to you.”\n\n“Do tell,” Pabbata replied neutrally.\n\n“Chanakya seems to have disappeared – he is neither in Taxila, nor among the Arjunayanas. I thus surveyed all reports of unusual people and activities from our territorial border and asked around using his physical description, and learned of a young boy with a black horse and a concealed face who is scouring around the Shoorasena country postulating odd questions about the *Order of Samkarshana* and the *Seal of the Peacock* \\[1\\].” \n\nPabbata inhaled sharply.\n\nThe Order of Samkarshana had been vanquished by Emperor Mahapadma, its members executed and its forts reduced to flour – ending one hundred and fifty years of expensive war. The Seal of the Peacock had been their emblem, the banner of resistance against Magadhan imperialism. And despite the brutal manner in which Magadha had suppressed any potential future rebellions in Mathura, widespread rumour remained of an underground continued operation of the Order. \n\n“This is his own emblem that he has shown to our disguised spies:—” \n\nDevajit produced a clay tablet with an engraved sign on it – a +, with two arms on its top-left and one on its top-right.\n\n“—do you recognize what this is, prince?”\n\nPabbata shook his head, although he recognized the Brahmi character. \n\nThe incredible thing, Pabbata realized, was that Chanakya would have a perfectly innocuous explanation for his antics – just as he had contacted the Arjunayanas to produce a conflict in Magadha, a wave that Pabbata could ride to power, this could also be his intention with courting the Order of Samkarshana. Of course, there were other factions within the Magadhan mainstream that he could take the support of instead, but Chanakya would probably argue that a larger number of players made it easier for an intelligent strategist to sow chaos, or that he had even greater goals for Pabbata than what could be achieved from within Magadha. \n\nThe problem was that depending on Chanakya in this way required a great deal of trust from Pabbata – as Chanakya had already confessed. Much easier to just impress his father by betraying Chanakya.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*When, after having put down the enemy, and after having grown in power, a friend becomes unsubmissive, the conqueror should cause the friend to incur the displeasure of a neighbour and of the king who is next to the neighbour.* \n\n*Or the conqueror may employ a scion of the friend\'s family or an imprisoned prince to seize his lands; or the conqueror may so act that his friend, desirous of further help, may continue to be obedient.* \n\n*The conqueror should never help his friend when the latter is deteriorating worse and worse; a politician should so keep his friend that the latter neither deteriorates nor grows in power.* \n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 7.18:32-24\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHear, king of Persia!\n\nHear the words of Chakravarti \\[2\\] Dhanananda, who is possessed of an enormous and prosperous treasury, of secure territory with no enemies to his East but the vast seas, of an uninterrupted territory secured by an army of 3000 elephants, 2000 four-horsed chariots, 20,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and many incredible devices and contravariances that your people have not heard of even in fantastical tales – to whom every other king bows his head in submission out of fear for the lives of his men, the dignity of his women, the freedom of his children, the security of his finances and the continued existence of his country.\n\nAll around you, King of Persia, your prophets and soothsayers – not only your rivals and the rebels, but even those whom you once regarded as your well-wishers – warn of your annihilation, of the end times of your empire, and accuse that it will be brought by you. \n\nLet me convey to you the wise words of the Ajivika philosophers of my own great country, who say that it would be foolish to blame you for such a loss, for men are but machines, that if you are prophesied for destruction, then that is your fate and there is no escape from it. For that is the inevitable consequences of your own choices, even as those choices were not truly yours. They say that you should seek solace in this fate.\n\nBut I say this: there are two choices available to you today, and even though you do not truly possess any faculties to make a choice by your own volition, the choice that is made for you will have a profound impact on how you are remembered by history.\n\nYou may seek my friendship and my goodwill – you may heed the wisdom of my kind words, then you shall know the generosity of a Magadha! Why, these petty conflicts you have with the Greeks could be resolved by the mighty king of Magadha, through my mediation, for such is my strength, such is my wealth, such is my power! I am a most desirable friend, and a most unpleasant enemy – such are the words spoken of the mighty king of Magadha in all the countries of the world. \n\nBut if you retain your unwanted presence in the country I claim as my own, then I fear that all the events that you dread the most – those doubts that harass your mind so intolerably, even as you attempt to suppress them, that your detractors might be speaking words of truth – will unfold before your very eyes. Your fears of being remembered in history as the emperor who gave away his country to the Sindhis and Scythians and Greeks, of having your beautiful realm ravaged by powerful armies on all sides, will become reality.\n\nThese are the words of the mightiest empire to have ever existed in the world – an empire that has not lost half an inch of territory in all its history, whose borders have never shrunk, whose kings have never failed to secure any land they set their eyes on; they are the words of the greatest ruler of such an empire, who is undefeated in battle, whose ambitions are great, to whom other kings come begging for mercy and largesse.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Astrologers, sooth-sayers, horologists, story-tellers and sign-readers, together with spies and their disciples, inclusive of those who have witnessed the wonderful performances of the conqueror should give wide publicity to the power of the king to associate with gods throughout his territory. Likewise in foreign countries, they should spread the news of gods appearing before the conqueror and of his having received from heaven weapons and treasure. Those who are well versed in horary and astrology and the science of omens should proclaim abroad that the conqueror is a successful expert in explaining the indications of dreams and in understanding the language of beasts and birds. They should not only attribute the contrary to his enemy, but also show to the enemy\'s people the shower of firebrand with the noise of divine drums on the day of the birth-star of the enemy.* \n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.1:7-10\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe messenger rose from his prostrated state, keeping his posture formal.\n\n“There are several pieces of grave news, O Great King of Kings,” said Haxamanish solemnly, his head bowed and his body trembling. He looked toward the courtiers helplessly, seeking their advice – the most aged of them, the Emperor’s most trusted advisor Ariyawratha, gave him a subtle encouraging nod, as if instructing him to proceed with the news without excessive formality.\n\n“Firstly – our most prosperous province, Gandhara, has been invaded by the Matsyaka Queen Kripa, who has secured the Western parts of the province. King Ambhi remains is loyal to us, but his court is fragmented, and he is forced to invest his resources against the advances of his Eastern rival Purushottama. Secondly – Hind has rebelled again; and this time, the kings of Kshana, Mushtika, Hindimana, and Patala have exchanged hostages and united in their rebellion against the Empire. And … and they have contracted the support of the Desert Yaudheyas.”\n\nThe court was silent – not because they were fearful, or because they had no questions to raise, but because they did not know what to feel, or what to think without explicit instruction from their God-king. But the God-king Darayavaush himself remained stoic, finding himself in a more complicated situation than he had ever known.\n\nIt was Ariyawratha who spoke.\n\n“And how have they contracted the Yaudheyas, messenger? Surely they lack the funds to do so.”\n\nHaxamanish was shivering.\n\n“I believe … I believe, O Great King of Kings, and do forgive me for raising such an inauspicious possibility … I believe that security of the Imperial tax collection in Hind has been breached.”\n\nDarayavaush slammed his fist down in rage.\n\n“Do they believe that the Empire has no funds of its own beyond an annual collection from Hind? That we are entirely reliant on a mere two provinces for our entire administration, that we will allow such a prosperous country to secede from the empire without consequence?”\n\nBut his words were vacuous – for all in the court knew that Hind alone contributed a third of Imperial revenue, and the treasury had not saved as much from previous years as it ought to responsibly have. If Hind rebelled, and Gandhara’s position was seen as weak by the other Indian states, it was almost certain that the remaining states of the Punjab would pledge their support to Hind – or make a show of surrender to them. \n\n“What is the cause of these events?” asked Ariyawratha “What is that factor that has undergone such change in the East, that it appears the Empire is left with no allies in the region?”\n\n“Ally or no ally,” the Emperor growled, “We shall crush these rebellions and punish the traitors and all those who supported them, even if it bankrupts the treasury. I shall not be known as the Emperor who lost India.”\n\n“It appears—,” started Haxamanish, “There are rumours— there are reliable reports, that the Eastern Empire … ” he controlled his stammering, “The Eastern Empire is expanding its boundaries once again. It appears that they are preparing for a Westward expedition soon – and is likely that they are sowing dissension in our Eastern provinces either with intent to conquer them, or to secure their independence from the Empire so they can be used as buffer states against us.”\n\nDarayavaush let out a low growl. “So these rebels believe that the Easterners will come to their assistance?”\n\nThe messenger nodded. “The Easterners have set their sights on the city of Indraprastha – a site that is sacred to all Indians. If they conquer Indraprastha, they will truly be unstoppable, or so it is believed. But that is not all.”\n\n“What could be worse than all that we have just heard?” Ariyawratha muttered dejectedly, but no one heard him. Even as he had only seen in all his life a Persia undefeated in battle, he was still possessed of sufficient age and sense to see the signs.\n\n“The third piece of news,” Haxamanish stammered – his voice had become barely intelligible at this point, “O Great King of Kings … The rebellion is not only in the East – if rumour is correct … the king of the Greeks, Alexander, is planning an invasion of Persia. I fear to say this, Emperor – but such are the words used by your enemies in this very court: they say that the end times are near!— that the *Frashokereti* \\[3\\] approaches!”\n\nThe messenger’s bloodied head rolled down the carpet.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*He may enjoy in an equal degree the three pursuits of life: virtue, wealth, and desire, which are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three, when enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also itself.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.7:4-5\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and forty-nine years ago.*\n\n*The eleven-year-old Ekanamsha looked up at her mother with bubbly eyes. “Mother,” she asked, pausing her knitting for a half-minute. “How did you and Father marry?”*\n\n*Her twin brother Vāsudeva let out an exaggerated yawn from behind the cotton-paper manuscripts that he was scouring over, earning a disapproving look from Mother Devaki.* \n\n*“Your father won my hand in marriage at my swayamvara,” Devaki explained, reminiscing with a smile, “He had to defeat my many suitors, many of whom were princes and nobles – to prove to my father and I that he was most worthy of me, and that there was nothing more he desired in the world than me.”* \n\n*“You can’t prove a falsehood,” remarked Vāsudeva with snarky amusement.*\n\n*“VA̅SUDEVA!” his mother objected.*\n\n*Vāsudeva put down his book. “Forgive me, mother, I did not mean to belittle the love between you and Father. But there was NOTHING more he desired? REALLY? If there was NOTHING more he desired, why did he not just poison all your other suitors?”*\n\n*“VA̅SUDEVA!” Devaki cried again, but Father (Vasudeva) was guffawing.* \n\n*“What? There are many poisons that would go undetected in an autopsy.”* \n\n*“But would it not be suspicious if all the other suitors mysteriously died the day before the swayamvara?” Ekanamsha asked innocently.*\n\n*Devaki started: “Ekanamsha that is NOT the reason, that is NOT the point I am trying—”*\n\n*“Then he could have just poisoned those suitors who were sufficiently skilful to have a decent chance of defeating him. And perhaps undersell his own abilities prior to the date so as to not make it seem that all those who were stronger than him were dead. By the way, Father, what is the meaning of this word?”*\n\n*As Vasudeva peered into Vāsudeva’s book and explained the function of the mentioned surgical instrument, Devaki looked very cross at her son’s line of questioning.*\n\n*“Vāsudeva … ” she said tiredly, “This is the sort of thing for which we are sending you to Sage Samkarshana’s gurukula.”*\n\n*“YOU ARE SENDING ME TO ANOTHER GURUKULA? Do you not remember what happened in the previous one? I will study on my own, thank you very much.”*\n\n*“Sage Samkarshana is a foremost expert on ethics and virtue,” Vasudeva explained supportively. “For all your brilliance, my son, I believe that you are in necessity of an education on these matters.”*\n\n*“No! I do not believe you SHOULD have poisoned your other suitors – I’m merely saying that the fact that you didn’t, shows that there are other values you hold more sacred than Mother, like non-killing! I am not denying morals, I am pointing out the immoral present in MOTHER’S words, I’m EXPLAINING ethics! I don’t need Sage Samkarshana, I MYSELF am an expert on ethics!”*\n\n*“Vāsudeva, you are being far too arrogant–”*\n\n*“I do not need instruction to understand why poisoning your competitors is wrong! You didn’t need instruction to understand that – everyone understands that! Well, I suppose a barbarian might not, but a barbarian will also not be knowledgeable about the different types of poisons that may be used.”*\n\n*“An intelligent barbarian,” Ekanamsha mused. “Where have we ever seen one of those?”* \n\n*“Are you referring to the wicked King of Magadha?” Vāsudeva questioned.*\n\n*“No, brother, I’m referring to YOU!”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*There does not exist a ruby in every mountain, nor a pearl in the head of every elephant; neither are the saints to be found everywhere, nor sandal trees in every forest.*\n\n—Kautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Speak!” ordered the turban-clad man, his eyes bloodshot and filled with suspicion. \n\nThe boy had surrendered himself before him, but he still suspected a plot and had sent men to scout the camp’s surroundings to look for an ambush. The camp, located several journeys away from the capital city of Mathura in a well-disguised forested spot at the intersection of two streams, was by no means easy to find, nor was it a location that one might too often reach by chance.\n\nShockingly, the captive’s voice was steady, unaffected apparently by the sword that had been placed at his throat and the archers that had been readied on him.\n\n“What do you wish to know first? And keep in mind that as I came to you voluntarily, anything you wish to know is also something I wish to be known by you.”\n\nAchyuta took a moment to consider this. \n\n“How did you learn of our location?” he asked finally.\n\nThe boy did not make any attempt to loosen the scarf that he had wrapped around his face. His eyes were all that were visible, and they darted upwards to meet Achyuta’s gaze. \n\n“That’s a good start,” he said. “I thought quite hard about how I could find, in reasonable time, a people who did not wish to be found – at first, I thought of monitoring food shipments and such—”\n\nAchyuta snorted.\n\n“—but obviously, if you were smart, you would simply grow your own food, irrigating your fields through groundwater. So I thought next: what would you most certainly have the necessity to import, that you cannot produce yourself? I realized that a camp like yours would likely be planted with traps and such devices, and I started asking around for families where an engineer had gone missing recently.”\n\n“And what did you find?”\n\n“I found many such families, but of course none of them knew where they had gone. Your people are very confidential in your affairs, clearly.”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\n“So instead I looked at matters from the following perspective: if Magadha hasn’t found your hideout yet, that must mean a limitation in their maps. So I scoured over government maps of the Shoorasena country, and identified regions where the tracts labelled appeared to be incomplete, or where there seemed to be rough transitions in the landscape that indicated a region missing from the maps.” \n\n“There must have been many such omittances. Did you check them all?”\n\n“*Then* I compared these places to the sites of disappearances of Magadhan soldiers, tax collectors and other agents. Thus, I identified five possible locations for the site of your camp – this is the fourth of the sites that I checked.”\n\n“Very clever,” Achyuta admitted grumpily. “I do not know to whom this is a greater embarrassment: to us, whose hideout was so easily exposed by a mere child, or to Magadha, who could not accomplish in so many years with their enormous number of military experts what a mere child did in a matter of fortnights. Who are you, boy?”\n\nThe boy slowly unwrapped his scarf to reveal his smiling lips: “You may call me *Kautilya \\[4\\]*.

The construction was started in 1847 (completed 1850) which was one year BEFORE Savitribai Phule\'s "school".**\n\n**Why are hundreds of women like them ignored to hail Savitribai?Because Savitribai Phule wrote poems glorifying British and Christianity?** (p/c [@onkarmantra](https://twitter.com/onkarmantra))\n\n[https://twitter.com/BharadwajSpeaks/status/1478050771216134144](https://twitter.com/BharadwajSpeaks/status/1478050771216134144)\n\n**Infact, Savitribai Phule\'s school was sponsored by British missionaries. Savitribai herself was awarded by British on November 16, 1852. British declared Savitribai as the best teacher.**\n\nThe question needs to be asked. The British were colonial invaders whose had no qualms in destroying India and kiIIing lakhs of Indians.What was their agenda in sponsoring Savitribai\'s project? Why interest did British have in Indian women? The answer will be very surprising. \n\nBritish treated colonial India as a dump for their men acting as soldiers of East India Company (&amp; later the crown). Around 100 military cantonments housed them in 1850s. These soldiers were living far away from their native country and had several needs. Including sensual needs \n\n**British used Indian women to fulfill sεxual needs of their soldiers.In every military cantonment, many Indian women were forcibly confined. They were not allowed to leave the premises. They were allowed to consort with British soldiers only. They were registered to cantonment.**\n\n**When people like Savitribai Phule were singing praises of British, Indian women were forced to undergo "physical examination" in cantonments. This was described as "surgical rαpe".**\n\n**Any Indian woman who tried to escape from the British military cantonment was severely punished**\n\n[https://twitter.com/BharadwajSpeaks/status/1478056675521093635](https://twitter.com/BharadwajSpeaks/status/1478056675521093635)\n\nEven the price was fixed by British.

However, there was something acting as a major deterrent.  \n\n\nThose were the days of complete anarchy. There was no security for women &amp; most families kept women inside the house. \n\n**Before I proceed further, I pause to ask a question.

Just kept repeating "it\'s the system that does it, this is same across all SBI\'s branches, submit 15 g &amp; don\'t know about other banks" etc., as if that gives them right to deduct TDS of customers whose interest income is less than ₹40,000. \n\nLeft the bank fuming, that\'s it.\n\nTldr; SBI is violating S.196A of IT Act, by deducting TDS on interest income from FDs that\'s less than ₹40,000.

      <li>Title::: 'Could my relative be a victim of grooming? Or is it all in my head?'<br />Body: 'Long post, TL Dr at the bottom. \n\nThis is regarding a 22 year old girl who is my distant relative. Her father passed away when she was very young and she was brought up by her mother who gave her a good education despite having mental health issues. Their only source of income is the pension her mom receives which is about 20k per month. \n\nMother and daughter live in a village on the outskirts of a tier 2 city. Daughter finished her BCom in 2019 at a college in the nearby city, and immediately started insisting on going to London for MBA. Due to financial reasons and lack of guidance, she dropped a year. Throughout 2019-20 her mother was applying for loans and asking relatives for money (20 lakh) to send her daughter abroad. \n\n2020- lockdown happened and everyone advised them against going abroad at this point, and instead apply for jobs in India. They asked me to contribute to send her abroad at this point, and I too asked them not to jump into decisions. My main concern was that the mother had no idea which University she is applying, which field she was going to do MBA in or any other details. Even the daughter was not very clear on these basic aspects. Apparently, they were depending on an agent who has taken other girls to London for MBA. \n\nSince I refused to help them out financially, they kind of stopped talking to me after that. I later got to know that they mortgaged some ancestral property and sold off her mom\'s jewelry to raise 20 lakh and sent her abroad in 2020 itself. \n\nFast forward to now: the girl has an insta account in which she hardly has 1000 followers, and she posts reels and photos in which she wears expensive, branded skimpy outfits (eg only bra and jeans, crop top and very short shorts). \n\nI want to clarify that I am not at all against the type of dresses that she wears, but I was shocked that she could afford such outfits. She is not an Instagram influencer. She doesn\'t post a single pic going out with friends/ in public places. All photos are taken in the same location which looks like a room/ bathroom. \n\nSome photos she gives PC to an Indian Muslim photographer settled in London. When I checked out his profile, it looks very shady, not at all like other photographer profiles. All her reels/photos have only 3-4 comments, everything by same 4-5 Indian and Pakistani muslim guys. None of them from her MBA college. No comments by her Indian friends. \n\nHer mother told my mother-in-law that her daughter has found a part time job there as a model and doesn\'t need her to send money anymore. But none of her photos look like modelling portfolio pics. \n\nI strongly suspect that she has fallen into the trap of some grooming gang or drugs, but when I discuss this with my relatives, they brush it off saying "that\'s why you don\'t give freedom to girls" \n\n"Didn\'t her mother realise while sending her abroad?" \n\nHer mother will just get angry at me and call me jealous and nosy. I have no idea how to go about now. Please help me out on what to be done next. Or is it all in my mind? \n\n\nTl Dr: Relative has sent her daughter to London for MBA and the daughter is taking part in shady activities, I have no idea how to proceed from here.'<br />Author: 'babyleafsmom'  id: 'ruyf1c'<br />Score:224<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ruyf1c/could_my_relative_be_a_victim_of_grooming_or_is/</li>
      <li>Title::: '"One of western modernity’s greatest cruelties is the fact that couples are expected to raise newborns alone. I’ll never understand it and it really is an impossible thing". By Siyanda Mohutsiwa, African activist'<br />Body: "One of western modernity’s greatest cruelties is the fact that couples are expected to raise newborns alone. I’ll never understand it and it really is an impossible thing \nIn other cultures you give birth and a flight of female relatives descends upon you to take care of you (make you food and do chores) and help with the baby. You don’t just soldier on in a two bedroom apartment with only a partner who works full time. It is totally absurd \nWhat I’m trying to say is this is not normal. Humans have been giving birth for millennia and nobody was excepted to do it alone. It’s not normal to expect someone/a couple to raise an infant alone. \nI don’t know who’s to blame. Obviously capitalism and it’s insistence that you can replace the functions of the extended family/community with products, gadgets and sheer will power. The lie that everything is a competition and that “good mothers” don’t need help. \nHumans are herd animals because we need lots of help. It’s not just because we’re social and it’s fun to have bants and jokes. It’s because we literally need help to make it through this life cycle called being human. \nI’m speaking as a person who used to spend weekends with newborn women in my family as the only daughter of the only son. I was 12-15, helping my cousins as best I could with newborn stuff. They also were staying with their mothers during the baby’s first few months. \nWhen you think about it like that it’s truly a miracle that western marriages survive at the rate they do. A newborn can destroy a single persons psyche never mind a whole ass marriage. I can’t believe anyone makes it out alive raising a baby alone. \nWhen I lived in a European city I used to hear my neighbor sobbing alone with her baby. I thought to myself, if this is “civilization” then I don’t want any part of it. \nI’m working on a longer piece that will expand thinking on this to include the practice of Botsêtsi, Stoler’s theory of culture as a toolset + literary things. In the meantime I don’t know what organizations to point to, but if you wanna buy me coffee\n\n\n&gt;You have eloquently said something that I have wondered about. Sometimes, in the west, I feel like I live in an economy than a society. Not sure of the history but I can't understand how everyone can live in such an isolated way without relatives &amp; friends as an extended family\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SiyandaWrites/status/1477360668709949440"<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'ruy3wr'<br />Score:103<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ruy3wr/one_of_western_modernitys_greatest_cruelties_is/</li>

All I see in the current scenario is either Hindutva or minority appeasement.\n\nAam Aadmi Party started as somewhat of a non-religious alternative but it saddens me how it has thoroughly marinated itself with the appeasement sauce over years. I don't blame them though. You gotta say what the people want to hear when you need votes. Maybe there's just too much democracy. I wonder what the politicians would have said when *sati pratha* was endorsed by the majority, if democracy had been around at that time. It would have been like how Sidhu is asking for the death penalty for religious offenders today.\n\nYou know what's the worst? Abrahamisation of Hinduism. With the advocacy of all those rigid principles and centralisation, it no more looks like a *nastak* friendly way of life as it did not long ago. Hindus are overwhelming giving up the spiritual side of the faith and adopting a political and radical one like their Abrahamic bros in the middle east and the west.\n\nI wish this country ran on reason rather than emotion. And I blame the weak institution of democracy for that. You'd do literally anything to stay in power even if it involves compromising liberty and incorporating radicalism into the ideology that represents you and your party."<br />Author: 'OwlSings'  id: 'ru9vz1'<br />Score:234<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ru9vz1/i_dont_need_a_secular_government_i_need_an/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'There is a problem of widespread discrimination against Hindus in Christian Convent schools and we need to address it.'<br />Body: 'Discrimination against Hindus in convent schools –\n\nWith the whole black cloud over the news of children being targeted for conversions in Christian schools, I asked one of my friends, if it was true. He had studied in Christian schools all his life across two different institutions, even went to a Christian college. He clearly put across that there is no problem of conversions in these institutes. Rather the problem is much more covert. The problem is discrimination. Discrimination against anything that is not Christian, and according to him, anything Hindu.\n\nI asked him to give me examples and he started dictating like some 80s executive and I was his secretary.\n\n# 1. Language discrimination. \n\nThey hate locals to speak their local languages in their school. English is compulsory. To the point that they would fine the students Rs. 3 if caught speaking in Hindi. If they were caught speaking in Marathi, the fine would be Rs. 5. Back in the late 1980s, 3 rupees was a big deal. Repeat offenders would be fined a whopping 10 rupees or even suspended. \n\nMy friend back then thought it was because the nuns themselves could hardly speak Hindi, let alone speak the vernacular language. How could one live in India and not speak any of the regional languages? He also recalled when the nuns humiliated a Marathi teacher for not being able to speak in English and forcing her to learn it and give a speech in front of the entire school one day. After the speech the principal said something like – “We are so proud of Mrs. XYZ because she has learned to speak in English and she has improved a lot.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. They would suspend students who would wear tilak or any other mark of a Hindu.\n\nMy friend spoke about a south Indian classmate who would wear the smartha way of applying vibhuti to the forehead – three horizontal lines of vibhuti across the forehead. He was sent home the first day he speared with it. His parents objected but they were warned that the school does not allow these displays.\n\nWhile the nuns roamed free with Christian crosses on their necklaces.\n\nMy friend also remembered that every one of the Christian students and nuns wore ash on their foreheads after Ash Wednesday – their Christian festival. And it was a regular school day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Discouraging bursting firecrackers and at the same time going all out with Christmas decorations.\n\nAlthough the public came to know about this a few years ago, this has been happening in convent schools for ages, even back in 80s. My friend distinctly remembers recalling the “sisters” talking about the evils of pollution by bursting firecrackers. He stopped bursting firecrackers after 8th standard because of this. He recalled how he actually felt guilty of ruining the environment.\n\nAt the same time, they would deck up the whole school with electric decorations for Christmas. That meant hundreds of bulbs and paper decorations. Evidently these didn’t cause pollution at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4. Punishing students for playing Holi.\n\nMy friend recalls being sent home the next day because he still had some colour left over from playing Holi the previous day. We used to play hardcore Holi during our childhood. This meant using “pukka colours”, that would remain on your skin the next day too. However, after cleaning up they would disappear in a day or two. And it would definitely not be so pronounced the day after. He was still punished and sent home and told to clean up and then attend school.\n\nHe also recalled a “sister” who used to punish young boys behind closed doors in her office, but the memory was hazy and should not be relied upon he said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this problem has been going on for more than 3 decades, how come we do not hear about it at all? \n\n# Turns out, these problems have been reported and no action has really been taken against the perpetrators -\n\nIn January 2017, **St. Joseph’s school** in Rameshwaram **suspended a student for wearing vibhuti** on her head. No action was really taken against the school. If the same thing was done to a minority student, imagine the backlash that would happen across the country. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2006, **St. Mary’s school in Panvel** made sure to conduct the **term exams during an important Hindu festival. The festival was Ganesh Chathurthi.** Any man visiting Maharashtra knows the importance of Ganpati during the festival and the school still chose to conduct exams during the exact day! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChristian propaganda is being spread in schools by asking students to draw Christian symbols and writing things like – **“Commit to follow Jesus because jesus is always right.”** Notice how the Sanskrit letter of Aum is casually crossed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmopf2lwa7981.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbe17361bb27338432e844eb7cd11d6aebef5324\n\n**Students in St. Mary’s Convent school in Kanpur were not allowed to wear or tie rakhis.** Girls of the school were not allowed to wear Kumkum after festivals. They were also not allowed to wear mehendi after a family function. This happened in 2015.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2018, a convent school named **Queen of Angel’s in Bharuch**, Gujarat **punished 40 girls by making them stand outside the class because they were wearing mehendi because of Gauri Vrat.** Again, the nuns flaunt their crosses and their religious attire, but god forbid a Hindu applies mehendi on their hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2017, a Christian Minority Matriculation School in Keezhapudur **punished their students for bursting crackers during Deepavali.** The parents took action and filed a police complaint against the school. After investigation it was found out that the same school had punished female students for applying mehendi – exactly as above. The modus operandi stays same across schools.\n\nNot just this, the school also went on to give commendation certificates to 7 students for not bursting crackers during Deepavali.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn February 2015, a girl studying in **St. Ann School** in Secunderabad, Telangana was **punished for applying tilak on her forehead.** The school management even tried to transfer the student out of the school by giving her a transfer certificate but stopped when her parents took it to the authorities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn October 2015, boys of **Doveton Girl’ &amp; Boys’ Hr. Sec. School** in Vepery, Chennai were **fined 500 rupees for having traces of mehendi on their palms.** Again, the mehendi was applied because of a family function the previous day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn June 2016, a boy studying in **St Vincent Pallotti School** of Bengaluru was straight up **expelled from the school for wearing a shikha or a shendi** – a lock of hair brahmins wear on their shaved head. The boy was studying in Lower Kindergarten. Imagine punisghing a 5 year old boy because of intolerance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn January 2018, students of **St. Joseph Convent School** in Namli, Ratlam were **punished for shouting “Bharat Mata ki Jai”** after the national anthem during school assembly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not even talking about the problem of rampant conversions that happen in these schools, because that is still a long way off to being dealt with. But to deny a Hindu student the right to practice his own religion is despicable.\n\nThere is no outrage when they partake in such reprehensible activities.\n\nAnd why would there be? Christian schools have gotten away with murder and genocide in the past. Quite literally. \n\nMillions of native North American children were forcefully separated from their parents and put in Christian boarding schools. There, they were starved and tortured to keep the native population numbers low. \n\nThey have killed more than a million such children across the colonies in America, Canada, Australia and South Africa. This is how they propagate the so-called word of Christ? By killing children and suppressing indigenous culture?\n\nThe Christian convent schools should be thoroughly investigated and a guideline should be put for their operations.\n\nNo more blatant displays of Hinduphobia. This has gone on for a century without any push back. Now that we push back and they cry foul?\n\nNo more.\n\nThat’s it. \n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources -\n\nA history of converting to Christianity in convent schools

      <li>Title::: "'It's very important to make a happy film that entertains' - Hrishikesh Mukherjee | Interview (1998)"<br />Body: '*Excerpts from a Rediff interview with Hrishikesh Mukherjee, just after the release of his last film, Jhoot Bole Kauwa Kate (1998):*\n\nHe is 77 years old. And has two artificial kneecaps. Which stops Hrishikesh Mukherjee from being very active these days. Age and infirmity though have not deterred his zest for film-making. Even though *Jhoot Bole Kauva Kaate* is his first film in ten years, Hrishida - as he is known respectfully throughout the film industry - seems almost casual about this week\'s release of his latest film.\n\nHrishida has always made films with small budgets and the family at its core, films which have often hit the bull\'s eye at the box office. Films like *Musafir* with Dilip Kumar, *Anupama* and *Satyakam* with Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore, *Ashirwad* with Ashok Kumar, *Anand* and *Bawarchi* with Rajesh Khanna, *Guddi* with Jaya Bhaduri, *Abhimaan* and *Mili* with Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, *Chupke Chupke* with Dharmendra, Sharmila Tagore, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, *Khubsoorat* with Rekha and *Golmaal* with Amol Palekar.\n\nAbruptly in the late eighties, Hrishida stopped making films. With the changing tastes and times, he didn\'t want to make films which people might not like. He moved to television for a while, directing 84 episodes.\n\nWhat brought him back to the movies was the dream run films like *Golmaal*, *Chupke Chupke* and *Khubsoorat* had on the satellite television channels. Producers began to pester him to return to the sets. Convincing him took the best part of two years, and Polygram finally signed him on to make *Jhoot Bole*.\n\n**Hrishida never formally learned film-making. His dream of wanting to be a cinematographer led him to become a laboratory assistant. He went on to edit films for Bimal Roy, at whose instance he moved from Calcutta to Bombay in the early fifties. He edited all of Roy\'s films till** ***Madhumati,*** **after which he decided to direct his first film at good friend Dilip Kumar\'s behest.**\n\nHrishida says *Jhoot Bole...* is a comedy, but the treatment is different. "It is very simple to be happy," he adds, "but it is so difficult to be simple."\n\n***Despite ill health, Hrishida took time off to speak with Sharmila Taliculam.***\n\n**You have always worked with dedicated, serious actors. What do you think about actors today?**\n\nI have made lots of comedies apart from serious films. I have worked with brilliant artistes. But today such films are not being made. The actors then were great performers.\n\nLook at the performances of Dilip Kumar or Raj Kapoor. They were so effortless and entertaining. I have always worked with good artistes even when I made serials.\n\nAnil Kapoor and Juhi Chawla are brilliant artistes and I have no complaints about them. I liked Anil in *Viraasat*. Juhi has performed extremely well in my film (*Jhoot Bole Kauwa Kate*).\n\nMy film is a situational comedy. It is a comedy, not slapstick. So I needed good artistes. They (Anil and Juhi) are fantastic artistes. The only thing is that film-making is so costly these days. People are not geared to do good, serious films.\n\n**How is that?**\n\nGrowing consumerism demands expensive entertainment. I think the audiences are to be blamed too. Otherwise, we still make films like *Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa*, but they are for very select audiences.\n\nIn my time I used get back the money invested in the film. They may not have been superhits, but they were hits. I was sure I would not lose money on a film.\n\nI used to make films for Rs 6 lakhs or Rs 7 lakhs (Rs 600,000 or Rs 700,000). Today the negative alone will cost Rs 10 lakhs (a million rupees). Forget the artistes, sets, the camera and such things. There are a lot of restrictions for a film-maker these days.\n\nI think somebody famous once said that till the price of raw materials comes down to the level of paper and pencil, it\'s very difficult for films to survive as an art form.\n\n**How have you adapted to the changing trends?**\n\nI have always adapted to the changing trends. I have moved with the tide, always. I have been in the industry for 53 years now. Since 1945.\n\nI made my first film in 1956 (*Musafir*). I joined New Theatres as a laboratory assistant. Then I started editing and then started writing scripts. But I was always flowing with the tide. There was no question of adapting to anything.\n\n**How did you come to the industry?**\n\nI was a teacher of mathematics and science. I had majored in chemistry and I wanted to be a cameraman. I was told to join as a laboratory assistant first. I did that. I would help the editor sometimes in my spare time. He was a friend.\n\nI would give my opinions and suggestion about various scenes and that impressed Bimal Roy who was directing a film. He asked me to edit his film, but I was a little apprehensive.\n\nI told him I had been editing for only two to three months and asked him if he had the confidence in me. He was a man of few words. He just told me he wouldn\'t have asked if he didn\'t have the confidence.\n\nHe asked me to take the permission of (New Theatre owner) B N Sircar. I did that. That\'s how I became an editor, with the film *Tathapi*. It was a big success.\n\nThen I quit because I wanted to continue studying. At that time, Bimalda came to Bombay and asked me to accompany him. I accepted and did all his films till *Madhumati*.\n\n**Is that how you made your first film with Salil Choudhary and Ritwik Ghatak? They were also involved in Madhumati...**\n\nI was instrumental in getting Salil Choudhary here to Bombay. We did *Do Bigha Zameen* together. We were childhood friends. I was always approached to make films while I was editing. But I didn\'t want to do it then. It was Dilip Kumar who convinced me to make a film finally.\n\nDuring the shooting of *Madhumati*, he would come to me and we would talk about a lot of things. Once he told me I should write and direct a film about a man, who would be the main character in the film, and a house where people came, lived and left. Only the house remained, with the memories. The subject should deal with three things. Birth, marriage and death.\n\nI told him with a subject like that it would definitely be a flop. Dilip assured me he would work in the film if I wrote it. And that\'s how I made *Musafir*. The film had three interwoven stories.\n\n**Was directing easy for the successful editor that you had become by then?**\n\nEditing and directing a film are two different things. I think.\n\nThe editor keeps the tempo of a film going, but a good director doesn\'t necessarily have to be a good editor.\n\nBimalda was a cameraman. He never edited films. But he was a good director. There are many like that. It certainly helps if you are a good editor since you keep the film interesting that way by maintaining a certain pace. But it is not necessary.\n\n**Did you always want to be a film-maker?**\n\nI wanted to be a biochemist and I became a film-maker. That\'s my fate.\n\nI was interested in plant life and wanted to study and teach it. But in a country like India you have little choice.\n\nGo wherever you are pushed by your fate. Mine got me to this industry. I have never regretted it. I believe one shouldn\'t waste time regretting things. Whatever one gets, one should make the best use of that and make it successful.\n\nWe had a tradition of science in my family since my father was a student of chemistry too. He stood first class first in his college, St Xaviers, Calcutta. So I took the same subject. And since you have very little control over your fate, I came to this industry.\n\nFrom the laboratory, I became a well-known editor and then I wrote my first script for Bimalda which was *Do Bigha Zameen*, and then went on to direct a film too.\n\nMy first film got the Gold Medal, the second got the Silver Medal. It was a meteoric rise and it was difficult to come back to your original plans since I enjoyed doing what I was doing. I was successful too. So I stayed on.\n\n**You have also worked with great actors. Have you at any point faced any problems with them?**\n\nI have worked with lots of stars. All superstars because they were popular and very successful too. Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Balraj Sahni, Sunil Dutt, Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan. Lots of them. You name them - I have worked with them.\n\nI don\'t think anybody has worked with so many stars. I never faced any problems with anybody. Or how could I make so many films? I was very fortunate. I got their full co-operation while making those films.\n\nI made maximum number of films with Amitabh. About seven of them. And with Rajesh Khanna I made four, I think. If I had any problems with these stars, I wouldn\'t have repeated them.\n\n**Why is that you always make simple family socials?**\n\nI am a simple man and I make films that I live. Maybe that is why they are called family socials. Middle class is the class I know and I always wove stories around the middle class.\n\nI am born in a middle class family and all my friends have middle class values. My attitude towards everybody is that way too. And most of my films have my scripts.\n\n**How did you manage to get the actors right for the characters in your films?**\n\nOne can be very good at what one does. But specialisation is a different thing. You can call a mason an artisan, but it is the architect who knows what his building should look like. He doesn\'t have the skills of the mason.\n\nSatyajit Ray got artistes who had never seen a camera. But they gave him what he wanted.\n\nI have a character in mind and I mould my actor into that character. How did I make Amitabh into the main character in *Anand*?\n\nHe was the main character because he is there throughout the film and through him, we get to know the story. Rajesh Khanna was the second main character. I just had to look at Amitabh to know that he was right for the role. People have their limitations. Sachin Tendulkar is the most brilliant cricketer I have seen, but can he sing a song? Everybody does what they are best at and this is my observation of life.\n\n**What about audiences these days? They like something of everything. Like violence, sex, romance, dances...**\n\nI don\'t think we can make a film with the audience in mind always. It doesn\'t work that way at all. Something is making you very indignant and you want to convey that to the audience.\n\nI read this book called *Satyakam* and I felt that indignation. I felt there should be no corruption when Independence comes. There should be honesty and this country should be beautiful.\n\nBut we find there is more corruption and the politicians are not patriotic at all. They are fighting amongst themselves. They don\'t care about the freedom of the country. That indignation was there within me. I made that film because of my feelings. It was a serious film and it didn\'t do well. That was my destiny.\n\nThen I heard about a short story about this girl who suffered a kind of anemia. And she is going to die as a result. But she falls in love and wants to live too. So I made *Mili*. But since the audience wouldn\'t understand the kind of the disease I would mention I made it simple with leukemia. Then *Golmaal* and *Khubsoorat* were made when I felt that I should make a comedy.\n\nOne should have freedom to do what they want, but then isn\'t a little discipline good too? Look at the tantriks. To attain freedom, how much discipline they go through. If you convey what you feel, then you are successful.\n\nI have my level of people, my generation who I explain these things to. I might not strike a chord with the front benchers maybe, but the middle class appreciates my films.\n\n**How did you meet Ritwik Ghatak?**\n\nRitwik was a friend. I have never worked with him as such. He just helped me with my first film. We had a circle of friends who would discuss films everyday.\n\nRitwik, Mrinal (Sen), Bijon Bhattacharjee, Salil (Choudhary), Utpal (Dutt), myself. We were one group. Then I came to Bombay, Mrinal went to Kanpur and we got busy with our lives. We made films of our types. That\'s it.\n\n**You have worked with Bimal Roy too. What was he like as a person?**\n\nBimal Roy is my film father. I have learnt from him. He was a man of tremendous sincerity. I have never seen him talking to a friend, going to a cinema or a party.\n\nTwenty-four hours he would think of films. And he had so much confidence in himself that he would take a newcomer like me and make an editor out of him.\n\nAll the people he took under his wings are great artistes today. He had a tremendous knowledge and grasp of the medium. He was a very open minded man. He made me an editor and also a scriptwriter. He suggested I should write the script of *Do Bigha Zameen*. The story was Salil\'s and I wrote it.\n\n**How did you come about editing Ramu Kariat\'s Malayalam classic, Chemmeen?**\n\nRamu was a good friend and he had shot *Chemmeen*. He had shot quite a bit and he didn\'t know what to do. He came to me and showed me what he had done and told me to edit it. He had shot the book page by page and there was a lot of material that wasn\'t required.\n\nHe left it to me to do what I wanted. So I shot a scene of waves crashing against the rocks since this was a film about a fishing village. This scene was then used to bridge two scenes that would have jarred if put one after another.\n\nI have done many things like that to help friends. They had the confidence in me. And I am grateful to them that they found my suggestions important. That was my job. I was assisting, that\'s all.\n\n**How do you visualise scenes when you edited them?**\n\nThere is a lot of imagination involved in making a film. Especially, if you are an editor too.\n\nIn *Do Bigha Zameen*, there is a rickshaw accident and when I wrote the script, I had imagined the camera following the wheel and people screaming and shouting. Then the next scene was in the night when the boy enters his house and asks his mother about the father.\n\nThere was something not right there. I shot the scene and I edited too, but I was not happy. The anxiety of the audience was not there and I thought why not transfer it to the child?\n\nSo what did I do? The moment the accident happens, I cut to a night scene and bang, the door flies open and the child enters, asking about his father.\n\nMany advised that I should not cut a day scene directly to a night scene. But I was sure I did the right thing. It was perfect. One has to think about a scene this way, there is no doubt about that.\n\nEven for *Jhoot Bole* I wanted to improvise a scene and I told Juhi about it. She liked it so much she wanted to re-shoot the scene again. I refused. But I will keep that in mind and maybe use it somewhere else.\n\n**Have you ever had formal training in film-making?**\n\nThere were no schools those days. We had to learn hands on. For me, Bimalda was the best institution I could ever hope to get. Also B N Sircar.\n\nWe learnt everything from the old masters by observing them constantly. That is why, though we friends had one mind about things, we still made films of our type. There was not much similarity in our films.\n\nOf course, if I had been in Calcutta, I would have made those kinds of films. Because in Bombay there is such a cosmopolitan set-up, I made films, which had that flavour.\n\nIn a Bengali film, one wears a dhoti and kurta, in the south they wear a vesti and in the north a kurta-pajama. The culture has to be maintained.\n\n**Is that how you gave that distinct look to your characters in Anand?**\n\nIn *Anand*, one was a Bengali and one was a Punjabi. So it was clear what they had to look like. I got the idea to make this film after I became friends with Raj Kapoor.\n\nIn fact it is a kind of biography. I wrote *Anand* when Raj Kapoor was not well. He was suffering from a pulse problem, but he still managed to smile and spread happiness around. I used to think if something happens to him, what will happen to me? We all were worried about him and he would be smiling always. The same way Amitabh would worry and Rajesh would brush it off.\n\n**Have you ever re-shot an entire scene after editing it?**\n\nOnly once have I re-shot a whole scene after editing it. But I don\'t do it otherwise. Not because I can\'t afford it. I was producing my own films then and I could have done anything I wanted. But I had confidence that I could do it at the shooting itself. I didn\'t need to re-shoot them again. I made *Anand* in 30 days and I was confident of what I shot.\n\n**Rajesh Khanna didn\'t give you any trouble, such was his reputation then?**\n\nNo he didn\'t. He gave me the required dates and shot through. He didn\'t give me any trouble at all. I used to call him Pintu Baba. I give nicknames to everyone. I call Amitabh \'Maharaj\'.\n\n**You must have your favourite actors and actresses though.**\n\nI can tell you of my favourite actress. Durgabai (Durga Khote). She was a brilliant lady and she was there in most of my films too. I had this feeling that with Durgabai in my film, it has to be successful. I considered her very lucky for me. It was her blessing.\n\nAnother actor I liked was Deven Verma. He always had a very joyful face. I liked his laugh very much. And Utpal Dutt. I almost stopped making films after his death. He was a very learned man and very close to me.\n\nI like to laugh a lot. Sometimes I get indignant and then I make films like *Satyakam*. They are hardly anything to laugh about. They are very serious subjects. But mostly I want to laugh and make people laugh too. Even *Jhoot Bole*. Don\'t expect my film to be very poignant at all. It\'s a very simple film.\n\n[Source](https://m.rediff.com/movies/report/its-very-important-to-make-a-happy-film-that-entertains/20130930.htm)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rtpqmu'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rtpqmu/its_very_important_to_make_a_happy_film_that/</li>

What a pity, went and came back within few days. Stayed here and now his children give us gyan on how much their parents loved india, didn\'t go   \n&gt;  \n&gt;IPTA (Indian People\'s Theatre Association) was &amp; remains the cultural front of Communist Party . Check Shabana Azmi and she is an active proponent of IPTA. It was under the communist ideology that Writers like Kaifi and even Shahir Ludhianvi supported created of pakistan..   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shahir in fact lived in Pakistan for about 6-7 months and pleaded with Indian govt to allow him back and lived here. Though people like Kaifi, Shahir and Naser\'s father (another muslim league member) were writing poems and giving speeches in favour of \'New Medina\'   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Javed Akhtar\'s Great grandfather Maulana Fazle Haq Khairabadi, gave a Fatwa to capture and bring down Hanuman gari temple in 1855.. British actually saved the temple.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Khairabadi instigated others to die for Jihad, he himself led a lavish luxurious life and never even saw a battlefield.Muslims tried to forcibly take the temple were killed by Hindus &amp; kharabadi issued a Jihad call against British. For which he was captured and sent to Kala pani   \n&gt;  \n&gt;He kept on pleading loyalty to British post 1857 and blamed some other Khairabadi. Jaan hisar Akhtar\'s father (Javed\'s) grandfather pleaded and British relented in exchange of loyalty.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now come to Naseeruddin Shah\'s family. His great grandfather Jan-Fishan Khan, supported the british in 1857, got a Jagir in Sardhana and pension of 1000. his father, Aley Mohd shah, was a Muslim league member, Behraich. UP. Voted for Pakistan , wanted to open a restaurant in Eng   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just didn\'t go anywhere .. stayed here and now he gives gyan to us about the deep love his family has for India. True that he is not answerable for his father but he can\'t invoke his father as well for staying here. Muslims of UP/Maha/TN/Kerala/Bihar voted for Pakistan..   \n&gt;  \n&gt;They just didn\'t go. Now take another case of Majruh Sultanpuri. He too wrote poems on greatness of Pakistan and stayed put here..   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Javed Akhtar\'s grandfather : Hindus are wretched beasts..📷  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Very few of these scumbags including their leadership left for Pakistan.. Even those who left kept a part of family in India &amp; few more like Raja Mahmudabad came back in old age to claim property in UP (Case ongoing). He funded Jinnah (His mama).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;This case was finally settled and [@narendramodi](https://twitter.com/narendramodi) govt amended the enemy property act to save the property. Congress was all set to give them the property.📷  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The term Ideology of Pakistan was first used in 1971 by Major General Sher Ali khan Patuadi Yahya khans information minister.  \nDo you know who is this Pataudi? Yes Uncle of Saif Ali Khan Patuadi.. Why did saif\'s grandfather stay here? Property was too huge here   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Saif\'s great uncle Mjr Gn. Isfandyar Ali Khan Pataudi was Deputy Director of ISI. Another great great uncle Mjr Gn. Sher Ali Pataudi was Chief of General Staff in Pak army, another great uncle Shehryar Ali Patuadi was PCB chairman.  \nIt was a well thought out stay   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Idea was to infiltrate the politics and make changes conducive to pakistan and capture from within and some were simply too lazy to go..  \nPeople who wanted Pakistan, UP/ Bihar/ Maha/ TN, Kerala,MP didnt go and who didn\'t want Punjab and NWFP (pathans) got it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Muslims of Hyderabad anyway thought that they will have a separate country and Nawab gave 150cr to pakistan in 1947 for helping them.. put it in a bank in London.. Owaisi\'s father was a Razakar.. now he gives gyan on how much he loves India   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Coming to Shahrukh khan .. Nice guy no doubt but his mother was adopted by Shah Nawaz Khan an officer in INA was a Minister under Lal B Shastri during the 1965 war, while his son Mahmud was fighting for Flag of Pakistan as a commissioned Officer.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nothing to add on Dilip kumar\'s love for Pakistan here. Only Salman is one who refused to campaign and appear for donations for Imran Khan\'s hospital saying, "I will do it only if you help my country establish a hospital.."  \nImran refused and so did Salman   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Syed Hossain Imam from Bihar, M. Mohd. Ismail from Madras, etc..to name a few of the host of Muslim League leaders,stayed back in India   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Raja of Mahamudabad, Begum Aizaz Rasul, Raja of Pirpur, Maulana Hasrat Mohani, etc. from U.P didn\'t go and their descendants give gyan here   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Though they had created Pak as the homeland for the Indian Muslims..not an iota of justification for such leaders being allowed. Congress abandoned the true nationalist Muslims, the Khudai Khidmatgars led by the Frontier Gandhi in name of geo-political realities.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thes people wanted to  negotiate with the world power for future of Indian Muslims and also about Future of Islam.Sub continent muslims were always at the forefront of the Middle East politics during WWI crumbling of the Caliphate.The sense of loss was recognized by Churchill   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ironically, Latifi,who was one of the architects of pak and a passionate supporter of Pakistan’s creation, did not move to new country.

      <li>Title::: '(Discussion) Philosophy of Yuga system of time as described in ancient scriptures and what I have understood they really mean'<br />Body: "No doubt our ancestors had pondered over things that even our modern generation doesn't even give much thought to. I have always been interested in learning how Human consciousness and their value systems as a species have evolved over the time. What I mean is few centuries ago a King would publicly hand anyone speaking against them and people accepted that. We can't imagine happening such things in modern times. But in modern times we are nowhere close to being fully conscious and moral beings it's just that we are a little more aware of human condition but continue to exploit the nature ruthlessly. Are we really any better than those in ancient times, maybe a little but not really.  \n\n\nWith this context in mind now suppose a time comes where Human consciousness has finally evolved to such a great extent that they can see the good and the evil as it is. Such a society is bound to prosper and explore dimensions of the existence which we can't even think of. When Humans are devoid of any prejudices against each other and so rather than directing all their efforts into protecting their small identities all they have left to do is ponder over bigger questions of life. I think that's what the **Satyauga** is. The age where Dharma is followed as it's supposed to be. But unfortunately nature of being is such that things evolve and devolve continuously so with the time Human morality also degrades and depending on the extent of the degradation various ages can be distinguished from each other. In next Yuga known as Dwapara Yuga there is some degradation of the society, In Treta Yuga there is significant degradation and in Kali Yuga society is completely devoid of Dharma which is what we can actually see happening for a long time now.   \n\n\nWe are definitely living in the age of Kali Yuga because we don't live by any principles but do whatever we can to get money, power, fame or fulfillment of sexual desires etc."<br />Author: 'abhiccc1'  id: 'rtgrcw'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rtgrcw/discussion_philosophy_of_yuga_system_of_time_as/</li>

I would rather pray at home on the most auspicious days. \n\nFollowing are the reasons why I don’t like going to popular holy sites anymore:\n\n- “Devotees” are at their worst at these holy sites - they follow no discipline, they treat these spots at picnic spot, they have no regard for other devotees, they loiter all around the spot, breaking queues, paying bribes for unofficial VIP entry, focused on selfies and pictures, they just create chaos..there’s hardly any tranquility or spirituality in the environment because of people behaving like idiots..\n\n- Local businesses, priests (most), vendors, beggars, taxis, almost everyone around these holy sites is trying to con people \n\n- While temples have crores in funds available, they hardly spend anything on making it more convenient for people, especially the disabled and older people \n\nWhile I am sad for people losing their lives and getting injured at the Vaishno Devi shrine, it was a result of mindless rush and a competition to get there first, people entering without permission slips and the trigger was an argument between the groups. This could have been avoided if people actually were actually there for the spiritual experience. It’s basically pagalpanti ..It could have been avoided. \n\nMy favourite spots, Kaidarnath and Vaishno Devi have these sad moments associated with them…thanks to mass stupidity and greed! It is quite frustrating! \n\nSirf darshan karne se kuchh nahi hoga..it would be a perfect scene if I could see meditation spots spread out around these places and people actually using them instead of going crazy for the darshan!'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'rtcy3u'<br />Score:193<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rtcy3u/unpopular_opinion_i_have_stopped_visiting_popular/</li>

Two rival hypotheses, both assuming a demic component to the language dispersal, have been proposed. The first of these places the origin of Austroasiatic speakers in southeast Asia with a later dispersal to south Asia during the Neolithic, whereas the second hypothesis advocates pre-Neolithic origins and dispersal of this language family from south Asia. To test the two alternative models, this study combines the analysis of uniparentally inherited markers with 610,000 common single nucleotide polymorphism loci from the nuclear genome. Indian AA speakers have high frequencies of Y chromosome haplogroup O2a; our results show that this haplogroup has significantly higher diversity and coalescent time (17–28 thousand years ago) in southeast Asia, strongly supporting the first of the two hypotheses. Nevertheless, the results of principal component and “structure-like” analyses on autosomal loci also show that the population history of AA speakers in India is more complex, being characterized by two ancestral components—one represented in the pattern of Y chromosomal and EDAR results and the other by mitochondrial DNA diversity and genomic structure. **We propose that AA speakers in India today are derived from dispersal from southeast Asia, followed by extensive sex-specific admixture with local Indian populations.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The analysis of autosomal data suggests bidirectional gene flow across the Bay of Bengal restricted to Austroasiatic-speaking and Tibeto-Burman–speaking populations. The presence of a significant (approximately one-quarter) southeast Asian genetic component among Indian Munda speakers is consistent with this model, implying their recent dispersal from southeast Asia followed by extensive admixture with local Indian populations. The strongest signal of southeast Asian genetic ancestry among Indian Austroasiatic speakers is maintained in their Y chromosomes, with approximately two-thirds falling into haplogroup O2a. Geographic patterns of genetic diversity of this haplogroup are consistent with its origin in southeast Asia approximately 20 KYA, followed by more recent dispersal(s) to India. **Comparison of mtDNA and Y chromosome data reveals that the “import of local genes,” at least in case of the Munda speakers of India, has likely been biased toward the female sex,** resulting in a situation where the southeast Asian ancestry signal in the mtDNA lineages of Indian Munda speakers has been entirely lost.\n\nTo summarise: This paper states that the Austro-Asiatic speakers of India- the Mundas originated in South-East Asia 20,000 years ago &amp; only the males migrated to India and intermixed with the female Indian population.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355372/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355372/)\n\n2020 paper: Dissecting the paternal founders of Mundari (Austroasiatic) speakers associated with the language dispersal in South Asia\n\n&gt;The phylogenetic analysis of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a-M95 was crucial to determine the nested structure of South\xa0Asian branches within the larger tree, predominantly present in East and Southeast Asia.

With this increased resolution\xa0of genetic markers, we were able to identify at least three founders downstream to haplogroup O2a-M95, who are likely to have been associated with the dispersal of Austroasiatic languages to South Asia.

Their genetic makeup holds components characteristic of South Asians as well as Southeast Asians. The admixture time between these components has been previously estimated on the basis of archaeology, linguistics and uniparental markers. **Using genome-wide genotype data of 102 Munda speakers and contextual data from South and Southeast Asia, we retrieved admixture dates between 2000–3800 years ago for different populations of Munda.** The best modern proxies for the source populations for the admixture with proportions 0.29/0.71 are Lao people from Laos and Dravidian speakers from Kerala in India. The South Asian population(s), with whom the incoming Southeast Asians intermixed, had a smaller proportion of West Eurasian genetic component than contemporary proxies. Somewhat surprisingly Malaysian Peninsular tribes rather than the geographically closer Austroasiatic languages speakers like Vietnamese and Cambodians show highest sharing of IBD segments with the Munda.

      <li>Title::: "Surekha Sikri in one of her last interviews: 'Feels like I've been discovered by a whole new generation'"<br />Body: '*(This was one of the last interviews Surekha Sikri did. It was taken when the veteran actor won her third National Award for \'Badhaai Ho\' in 2020. It was republished in view of her demise on 16 July, 2021.)*\n\nFor Surekha Sikri, the cranky and quirky mother-in-law/grandmother of *Badhaai Ho*, the film and its enormous success, followed by her winning the National Award (in the Best Supporting Role category), have been a major turning point in her life and career.\n\n“It feels like I have been discovered now by this whole new generation, even as I have been into films, theatre, and television for over 40 years now,” she chuckles. While Sikri was bestowed upon the National Award for Best Supporting Actress twice in the past - for Govind Nihalani’s *Tamas* (1988), and Shyam Benegal’s *Mammo* (1994), winning this time has been far more special for the veteran actress, who outclassed many younger breed of actresses, like Taapsee Pannu, Divya Dutta, Geetanjali Rao, and Rasika Dugal to take home the honour.\n\nCalling the comedy-drama a paisa vasool movie, Sikri says, “Parallel cinema had its own charm. It had its own place but *Badhaai Ho* is a dream role for an actor. It is a role with an arc. My phone kept ringing for many days, which has never happened before. I was also thrilled to get this token of appreciation from Amitabh Bachchan, who I long to work with. *Badhaai Ho* has influenced a lot of filmmakers to make feel-good family films, the story was so well written, and the script was first rate.”\n\nSikri was hungrier more than ever to sink her teeth into many more challenging roles. Quite a few makers were keen to rope her in their projects after her scene-stealing moments in Badhaai Ho. But an unfortunate incident, that occurred about a year ago derailed her life as well as her career. “I had a brain stroke 10 months ago. I fell down and hit my head in the bathroom in Mahabaleshwar, where I had gone for a television shoot. Now my wheelchair has become my companion. I feel so helpless. I am unable to stand straight. I received a number of awards for *Badhaai Ho*, and I went to receive those on the wheelchair. It would have looked very odd to get up from among the audience, and climb all those steps to reach the stage. It would have become a big tamasha,” she says.\n\nPlaying a parent of lesbian girls, and portraying a yesteryear actress, are two of the most "exciting" roles that she regrets losing out on because of her accident, she says. “Lot of doors opened up for me, and I would have done better work had this accident not happened. I had discussed the projects with the makers but they have returned my dates obviously because they are scared that they may not get what they want. One of these films wanted the subtlety of moment with hand and foot but I guess I can’t please them enough. For the film about the gay children and their parents, and how they reach an understanding, the director wanted subtle gestures which I may not be able to do. I would have loved to play Nazia, the actress of yesteryear. I had read the script. But I wouldn’t like to spoil it. I would not be able to do justice to it though I should be more positive in my thinking that I can do it,” says Sikri.\n\nWhile Sikri is hoping to bounce back soon, and tries to keep a positive outlook, she does feel low at times, she says. “This is a real disability for an actor. You can’t use your hand, foot, and your body the way you want to because it is not following your commands. This is really very frustrating for an actor. Body language and movement is a great deal for me. People get scared and maybe they can’t trust me with any role whether I will be able to do them or not,” says the actress, sounding disappointed, especially since she does not want to retire ever. “I don\'t believe in retirement. My mind keeps working. It keeps clicking,” she says.\n\nHowever, a small role in Netflix\'s *Ghost Stories* has come as a boon to her in these trying times. It has definitely lifted her spirits. She recently finished shooting her part for the story directed by Akhtar, that has Janhvi Kapoor playing one of the leads. “My role is that of a patient. She is being taken care of in her own apartment by a nurse, played by Janhvi Kapoor. It was a very interesting experience, and I enjoyed working with Zoya’s team. They are all so committed to their work. I didn’t find that kind of professionalism and commitment in television or elsewhere.” says Sikri.\n\nAnd of course, memories of *Badhaai Ho*, and her character\'s crackling one-liners bring a big smile on her face. She does not tire talking about the film, and its team. She appears amused thinking how she bagged the role. “Amit (R Sharma, director) wasn’t sure about casting me. I think all good filmmakers are terrified by television actors. They are often looked down upon by the filmmakers, and that is because television actors have a very unsubtle way of acting, whereas Amit likes subtlety. I was delighted that such a good role was being offered to me, and I didn\'t want to lose it. I heard the narration, and after one or two days, when I didn\'t hear from them, I was worried, and wondering whether they would cast me. It took them a while to decide upon me. But Amit didn’t tell me who he had in mind if not me," says Sikri, laughing heartily.\n\nBorn into an Indian Air Force family, Sikri’s entry in the acting profession was purely accidental. “My younger sister was interested in becoming an actor whereas I wanted to become a writer or a journalist. When we were studying in Aligarh, Al Kazi (Former Director, National School of Drama) brought *King Lear* to our college. My sister was impressed but due to certain circumstances, she changed her mind, and instead, on my mother\'s insistence, I filled up the NSD admission form that was being distributed in the college. I cleared the interview as well as the auditions and got admission in NSD, and I shifted to Delhi in 1968,” she reminisces.\n\n“Al Kazi was an extraordinary and an extremely disciplined teacher. He taught us all the right values of respecting work, and doing it wholeheartedly. Besides acting class, we also had lessons in costume designing, make-up, lighting, music, and play analysis. He took us to concerts, museums, and painting exhibitions to teach us about art. I also learnt a great deal about play writing. It was an enriching experience. My first play was a Greek tragedy, *The Trojan Women*, and I played the ‘Helen of Troy.\' We had some distinguished names in the same batch, like Manohar Singh, Om Puri, Raghubir Yadav,” she recalls, adding, “That is how my career was decided but I am very happy with what happened by chance. Acting helped me open up because I was an extremely shy person. You need to have the courage to expose yourself,” she says.\n\nAfter completing her graduation from NSD, Sikri bagged her debut film, 1978 political drama *Kissa Kursi Ka* (with Shabana Azmi in the lead) while she was working in the NSD repertory. Later, when Sikri shifted to Mumbai, she followed up her film career with Saeed Mirza’s *Salim Langde Pe Pat Ro*, Prakash Jha’s *Parinati*, Shyam Benegal’s *Mammo, Sardari Begum, Zubeidaa,* and *Hari Bhari*, Aamir Khan starrer- *Sarfarosh*, and Rituparna Ghosh’s *Raincoat*. “But my work on the big screen has been sporadic. It was in bits and pieces, a small role here, and a small role there. I haven’t done many movies. I could have done something much better but it didn’t happen due to certain misunderstandings. Also, I am very bad at networking, and kind of stay away from people,” she says.\n\nQuite surprisingly, Sikri, who was so passionate about theatre, did not do a single play in Mumbai. It was television that gave her more fame and recognition. “I rang up a few theatre groups in Mumbai but they weren’t very encouraging. Here, theatre groups are quite clannish, and they function in closed groups. It would have been quite a struggle for me had I continued with theatre. But bagging television projects was much easier. I did *Banegi Apni Baat* (1994-98), followed by *Just Mohabbat* (1996-2000), and both were successful shows. But many years later, it was my character Dadisa in *Balika Vadhu* (2008-16) that made me a household name for almost eight years,” she says. “I occasionally miss that magic of theatre. I love the lighting, and it’s so magical when you see the audience looking like a dark spot in the auditorium,” she says, with her expressive eyes going wide.\n\n“Off late, television has become quite regressive. They keep copying each other and show things just to shock people. They say outlandish things, have over- the-top acting and stories. They show the same old-fashioned stuff. I need to connect with the script. Only when ideas attract me, I say a yes,” she adds.\n\nHowever, with the encouraging response to *Badhaai Ho*, Sikri, who believes the quality of cinema has improved considerably, would like to do more movies. “I feel that the quality of cinema has improved after Irrfan (Khan) and Nawazuddin’s (Siddiqui) *The Lunchbox*. I like Nawaz, and I am happy to say that Nawaz and I did *Sarfarosh* together though we didn’t have any scene together (laughs). I like Irrfan too, and I am so delighted that Ayushmann (Khurrana) and Vicky Kaushal have also won the National Award,” she says.\n\nSikri is still hungry for good roles, and characters with grey shades is something that she finds much more exciting. “Earlier, I played more soft, goody-goody parts but now I am getting to play characters with slightly negative or grey shades, which I like more because I find their psychology more interesting. I don’t like being sweet-sweet (laughs),” she says with a twinkle in her eyes, adding, “I would love to play a social activist. I am an activist by nature.”\n\n[Source](https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/bollywood/surekha-sikri-in-one-of-her-last-interviews-feels-like-ive-been-discovered-by-a-whole-new-generation-7450331.html)\n\n. \n\n&gt;Amit (R Sharma, director) wasn’t sure about casting me. \n\n[Inside A Scene (Film Companion)](https://youtu.be/xQT44nkV8Sw) - Amit Sharma talked about this in detail.'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rsujal'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rsujal/surekha_sikri_in_one_of_her_last_interviews_feels/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My Friend Guru - Dev Anand remembers Guru Dutt'<br />Body: '\nGuru Dutt was one of the greatest icons of Indian cinema, a man ahead of his time and the creator of ageless masterpieces, who contributed to the golden age of Bollywood. Though he has made less than 50 films in his entire career, Dutt left a deep impact on the Indian film industry. Two of his works *Pyaasa* and *Kaagaz Ke Phool* were included in Time magazine’s ‘All Time 100 best movies.’  \n\n*Check out this Dev Anand Interview on Guru Dutt from 2011*\n\n**Dev Anand | 31 May, 2011**\n\nIn 1946, I was on the payroll of Prabhat Film Company and was playing the lead in my first film, *Hum Ek Hain*. One day, as I was walking out of the studio, I saw a young man of about my age entering, and we exchanged polite hellos. “Are you doing the main role in the picture?” he asked, and I replied, “Yes.” He offered me his hand. “Well, my name is Guru Dutt and I’m an assistant director. Great to meet you. I hope to see you here more often,” he said. He gave me a beautiful smile and started to leave. A few seconds later, he turned and stared at my shirt. I looked at his. I realised he was wearing my shirt and I was wearing his. Obviously, the washerman had interchanged them. We had a hearty laugh and embraced each other. We were to be friends for all times.\n\nThat was how I first met Guru. We promised each other that the day I became a producer, I’d take him on as a director, and the day he directed a film, he’d cast me as a hero. And I’m not a promise breaker. I did launch Guru as a director in Navketan’s *Baazi* in 1951. He even appears in the beginning of the film.\n\nNobody’s ever known Guru better than me. He would travel by buses and trains to pick me up from my home in Pali Hill and take me to his place in Matunga. His mother would take us into her kitchen, make *chapattis* and serve us food. Often, he’d bring his camera with him and photograph me in Pali Hill, at a gold club that doesn’t exist anymore. Guru was fond of taking pictures, of making pictures. He was hardworking and intelligent. Later, I discovered he was also fond of acting. But I don’t think he was a great actor. He was a better director. He used to waste a lot of footage. \n\nWe had different personalities, but connected in many ways. He suffered from melancholia. He was a good man, a good thinker, but a back bencher. He never wanted to be part of a crowd. He was shy, but good at his work. However, he couldn’t take failure. Look, everybody meets with success, but you also face failure. Not every film is a masterpiece, not every film is a hit. But a film from a good maker is a good film. The day he realised his film was not a hit, he could never make one again. The day he realised that his *Kaagaz Ke Phool* did not do well - he’d gone to Delhi to open it in the presence of President S Radhakrishnan - he was a sad man. He never went behind the camera to direct; he only acted. He took Abrar (Alvi), but never had the courage to direct. *Woh cheez khatam ho gayi thhi (Something in him had died.)* But you’ve got to be strong - unless you are strong, you cannot live in this world. *Woh weakness thhi uski. (That was his weakness.)*\n\nHe made sad pictures. People call some of his films classics today - mostly, *Kaagaz Ke Phool* and *Pyaasa*. But at that point, nobody liked them. It was later that a wave began and people started admiring his work. Who would believe that those films were made by a director in his mid 30s?\n\nI’ve done more films with my brother Goldie (Vijay Anand) than Guru. They were different directors in every possible way. I’d say Goldie was more dynamic, but Guru had his own style. I did only three films with Guru: *Baazi* and *Jaal* ; as you’d know, *CID* was only produced by him. Today, I miss Goldie as a great director who handled me well, and Guru as a great comrade, a dear friend of my age with whom I could laugh and share jokes. When I had my love affair with Suraiya, I was closer to Guru than anyone else.\n\nI remember Guru and I watched the Italian film *Bitter Rice (1949)* at Excelsior theatre and he was so impressed that he decided to use it as an inspiration for *Jaal (1952)*. He asked me, “Dev, will you be my villain?” I said, “Karunga bhai, karunga. (Of course, I will.) As long as my role is central.”\n\nI’m saying this for the first time but *Baazi* was conceptualised after *Gilda*, Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford’s 1946 film. Those days, Balraj Sahni had just returned from the BBC as a commentator and he needed a job. He was a good writer and I brought him and Guru together. They were looking for a script and finally took the idea for *Baazi* from *Gilda*. We were surprised to find that the ‘good boy on the wrong side of the law’ subject could work so well. The film was a huge hit. I went to Ahmedabad, and hundreds and hundreds of boys and girls ran after my car. While I wouldn’t say I tasted stardom for the first time with *Baazi* - I had experienced fan frenzy in *Ziddi (1948)* before - it did make me a huge star.\n\nAnd it launched many careers. Sahir Ludhianvi became famous for his lyrics. He was a great poet who could express feelings simply. *Uske alfaaz chubhte thhe. (His words would pierce.)* Then, my brother Chetan brought Kalpana Kartik, who would later become my wife, from St Bede’s College, Shimla. It was her first film, and when it became a hit, I wrote to her saying, ‘*Baazi* has clicked.’ (Laughs out aloud) And she innocently asked me, “What does clicking mean?” Johnny Walker used to hang around the sets trying to get noticed, and we did notice him. We all loved him, gave him his first chance and he remained a friend throughout. And, of course, SD Burman, whose music for *Baazi* is still remembered. When I went to Jodhpur, a distributor told me that pilots from the nearby Air Force station would come into the theatre every time the song *Tadbeer se Bigdi* played.\n\nSo many people came into my life, but Guru and I shared something different. Our journey began together. I’ve always said he was my only friend and I repeat that today because *jab Dev Anand star ban gaya toh phir kaun sachcha dost banta hai? (After one becomes a star, how does one really make true friends?)*\n\nIn the last days of his life, he called me and said he’d love to have me over. I saw the man then, he’d lost his hair and was weak. He was suffering. He was not the same Guru I’d known. We discussed making a film together. I told him, “Look, why don’t you write a great script? Let’s do it.” This was three days before he died. When I heard of his death, I went straight to his home. I was the first man to go into his room. His dead body was lying there. There was a glass of blue liquid on the floor. He was sallow. And dead.\n\n(Takes off his reading glasses and bends forward) When I first met him, *mujhe aisa lagaa ki bohut lambi daud daundenge hum saath mein, par woh apne mein kaheen kho gaya. (I thought we would live and run together for a long time, but he lost himself within somewhere.)* He should have made more films. He had so much in him. Thirty-nine is not an age to die.\n\nThe image I want to keep of him is not of that Guru, but of the Guru with whom I shared the most special friendship of my life. *Zindagi ki daud mein uske jaisa dost phir kabhi nahin mila. (In life’s run, I never found a friend quite like him.)*\n\n[Source](https://openthemagazine.com/essays/arts-letters/my-friend-guru/)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rst9l2'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rst9l2/my_friend_guru_dev_anand_remembers_guru_dutt/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How to protect Hinduism in India from Christianity in the long-run'<br />Body: '[https://structures.substack.com/p/part-1-how-to-protect-hinduism-in](https://structures.substack.com/p/part-1-how-to-protect-hinduism-in)\n\nReligion is often one of the most misunderstood things -often mistakenly seen as a pursuit for God, religion is not a theoretical unselfish endeavor, as it is a- colliding of selfish wishes, fear and community.\n\nMany countries have and are currently seeing a rapid change in demographics(eg Nepal -Christianity went from 1%-10% within 2010-2020 ,South Korea Christianity went from 1%-30% within 3 decades ,Africa christianity went from 1% to 50% within a century -wiping out the indigenous religions)- while many for time immemorial seem to be in a stage of steady continuity - unchanged by outside forces ( Afghanistan has seen a negligible change despite foreign occupation and domination for more than 2 decades, Poland despite the communist regime has seen Church attendance and religiosity stay more or less the same throughout its domination, Even russia for that matter did not see a decline in religiosity even during the period of the Soviet Republic).\n\nIndia too is seeing a rapidly changing population with large numbers adopting christianity, sponsored in part by the excessive funding coming in through the FCRA($2-3 billion every year). [Arunachal Pradesh has gone from 1%-30%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Arunachal_Pradesh) within 3 decades 1981-2011, Kanyakumari district has gone to close to 50% within a few decades. Similarly other states such as [Andhra Pradesh have gone to 20%](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/the-real-number-of-andhra-pradesh-christians-is-grossly-understated-heres-why)(although currently not accounted for by census data, [Tamil Nadu has gone to 10%](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/why-crypto-christians-may-be-keeping-tamil-nadus-numbers-below-actual-levels)\n\nWhile the factors that lead to religious change and causing religious change are often more clearly understood - a partitioned society and society in flux, monetary power to convince, physical and political power to coerce, and a radical clergy and link to society to enforce, the factors that strengthen continuity are often slightly less well understood.\n\nLooking at the countries that have maintained a continuity in religion despite odds we can come up with certain factors that can be used to enhance continuity.\n\n1)***Linking of religion with identity*** \\- not with political party but with identity- despite religion not being a rational endeavor however linking of religion with the identity and especially a victim identity, in our case framing our identity as coming from 1000’s of years of a religion- that has been repressed, and linking religion to nationalism can help create a religious identity that is more robust against external attack and lasts longer, it makes people less receptive to other ideas and as a group less tolerant to external attack.\n\nCountries that show great examples of this include Poland, where despite the Soviet repression, religion survived and prospered. This was because religion was closely linked to the national polish identity. Thus even today Poland has record church attendance and a large no of Individuals, even in the younger generation, see themselves as Christians. Another example is the USA where the link of religion and Nationalism led to record high church attendance- only post the end of the soviet era did it start falling.\n\n*Solution:1)Link identity of person, group, village, country with Hinduism - tell them how they relate to the Hindu tradition -and how they are continuations of a 10,000 year old civilization which has been victimized by external forces- how they call our gods evil, how they spend billions of dollars to convert us, how thousands of ancestors died to keep them away2)Create local gods and relate to other gods in Hinduism3)Create an othering of other religions -stress on how Christians view Hindus as enemies and Hindu gods as false gods, the foreignness of Christianity.*\n\n***2)Creation of diversity within rather than outside***\\- Despite whatever religion one may belong to there is often a variety seeking behavior, between generations ,among the frustrated, among the condemned etc. and this often leads to space for new religious movements to arise and share space.\n\nThe most successful religions are not those that don’t allow for this space but those that create a framework and working space within which these religious movements can operate. For eg. the long term success of Christianity can be attributed to the fact that a lot of religious movements that arose operated within the framework of Christianity whether it be the Pentecostals, the Baptists, the SDA etc. Although with a variety of teachings they operate within the framework and at least in name profess belief in the Bible traditions\n\nThe death and unification of such movements in Hinduism is something that has led to the frustrated to look for options outside this net.\n\n*Solutions:1)By creating new movements such as Arya Samajis which profess belief in one-god or other neo-hindu movements some of the frustrated can be prevented from shifting board and venturing outside the religion.2)Promoting Buddhism among the repressed and creating a Buddhist movement for Dalits -led by strong Buddhist leaders and strongly funded by Buddhist missionaries can prevent the coming in of foreign religions*\n\n3)***Creation of alternates and avenues for needs that are served*** \\-Despite whatever we say about religions they do function to serve particular needs - for example the congregation creates a community, the pastor and religious writings serve to guide in times of difficulty, the God a place to put your troubles.\n\nIn the absence of alternates people find it difficult to switch, an example of success of such solutions was in Soviet Russia- despite the atheist nature of the country people would go to church to get married. It was only when the govt. allowed marriage celebrations in Halls in the city - the people switched, and this tradition has continued post the end of the Soviet Republic\n\nThus it is often in absence of internal solutions that people are forced to look outside for solutions. By creating solutions that meet these needs, the need for such external religious solutions(adopting other religions) can go down.\n\n*Solutions:1)Creating online-communities and organizations for temple festivals, creating a sense of community and linking with Hinduism2)By creating Gurus and Hindu guides who guide people during difficulties ensure people do not leave the faith and have a personal touch to help them tide over difficulties and prevent them falling prey to predatory religions3)Creating Hindu motivational songs, stories and content which motivates people during different types of trouble and makes them believe that Hindu gods can solve their problems*\n\n**4)Creating avenues for leadership and purpose** \\- Most people lack purpose in their life, and during the free time they may lose motivation for life. Also for many religion is not about religion but a framework and location to rise and succeed in the community.\n\nBy creating a framework to allow individual gurus and priests in the hindu community to rise and succeed acquire not material but social capital by propogating the Hindu religion we can create a system where more entepreneurial and religious spread efforts by the Hindu priest-dom are encouraged.\n\n*Solutions:1)Public honoring and awarding of priests who spread Hinduism in India and abroad2)Allowing new priests to arise and shielding successful priests and gurus such as Asaram, Nithyananda who do a good job spreading Hinduism(sacrificing small scale individual rights for the civillisational rights)3)Creating a public mission whereby individual Hindus are encourage to spread Hinduism and to protect Hinduism*\n\n***5)Encouraging Hindu festival celebration -*** Festivals link us not only to our past but also our good times and memories. By encouraging festival celebration Holi, Diwali by means of crackers, water colors we can link the celebration and god to the individual and ensure it becomes harder to cleave him from the pack\n\nOne example of this is in the Roman times, the Christians unable to cleave people off their traditions decided to link the traditions of Christianity and Paganism. Thus Saturnalia became Christmas and many practices such as the Christmas tree were adopted wholesale. Protecting the festival thus becomes paramount to retain the civilization\n\n*Solutions:1)Encouraging all types of celebrations - crackers, parties during Diwali and encouraging pooja as well. Reversing all cracker bans and encouraging increasing celebrations2)Encouraging celebrations on social media- putting up picture of India during Diwali, celebration on social media to encourage people to remain connected with the festival*\n\nLet us come together to protect this beautiful legacy, the idea of India is rooted in the Civilization and this civilization, in our religion, death and decline of Hinduism would lead to the decline of a civilization which currently has lasted thousands of years.'<br />Author: 'ramesh-suresh'  id: 'rs4qit'<br />Score:78<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rs4qit/how_to_protect_hinduism_in_india_from/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Incredible Story of India’s First Miss India: Esther Victoria Abraham (1913-2006)'<br />Body: '***Khalid Mohamed pays tribute to the first Miss India (1947), Esther Victoria Abraham, who became a popular actor, the nation’s first woman film producer and a lasting emblem of feminism.***\n\nIt’s surprising that no biopic or web series has been attempted so far on the believe-it-or-not life travails and the uncrushable spirit of Esther Victoria Abraham (1913-2006), aka Pramila. She starred in as many as over 30 stunt films and social dramas, right from Return of the Toofan Mail (1935), which was never completed though, and was last glimpsed in the role of a feisty grandmother at the age of 89 in Amol Palekar’s Marathi film Thaang. \n\nPramila had scored many firsts in Bombay’s glamour business. At the age of 31, and pregnant, she was crowned the country’s first Miss India in 1947 - the year of India’s independence - at a ceremony conducted at Liberty cinema. She went on to become the first woman film producer; fifteen films were made by her, under her banner Silver Productions. Her daughter, Naqi Jahan, was also adjudged Miss India in 1967. They remain the only mother-daughter duo to have been crowned at the high-profile event. \n\nTo go back in time, Pramila’s dramatic life story had taken an ugly U-turn when she was jailed by Morarji Desai, Chief Minister of Bombay State from 1952-’56, on the charges of spying for Pakistan. The charges proved to be unfounded, since it was established that she would travel across the border for publicity campaigns of films, which were permitted to be screened in Pakistan then. Quite inevitably, perhaps, paranoia was running high in the Indo-Pakistani relations following the partition. \n\nAs an aside, at this point, it may be mentioned that during the early 1960s, intelligence agencies had intercepted some signals of a radio transmitter from Dilip Kumar’s house in Bombay with a contact in Pakistan. When the transmitter was located, the legendary actor had clarified that he was fond of Pakistani music. Since the Pakistani radio had been banned, he had to resort to the transmitter. An investigation committee concluded that the actor was innocent.\n\nHowever, in the case of Pramila the damage had been done. Her property and assets, in the process, were requisitioned. Abandoning all the trappings of stardom, Pratima would travel in buses and trams to fight court battles. It is believed that she had to juggle her film finances to fob off auctions on two occasions and a civil injunction on another. To an extent, Pramila’s story has a parallel with that of Mary Ann Evans of Australian origin, who was canonised as Fearless Nadia for her death-defying stunts in a series of films, 1935 onwards with Hunterawalli. Stunts are where the similarity ends though. \n\nA narrative, if one is ever attempted, on Pramila’s life, is way more complicated and eventful. Born Esther Victoria Abraham to a migrant Iraqi Jewish family in Calcutta, her father was a businessman. One of his companies would lay railway lines and construct signal stations contracted by the British government. After her mother passed away, Esther was doted upon by her paternal grandmother, after whom she had been named. As her father’s business fortunes declined, she was enrolled at the affordable St James School, where she became a hockey champion. And since she excelled at drawing, she received a degree in the arts, administered  by Cambridge University. \n\nHowever, Esther was inexorably drawn towards a career in either films or theatre. Initially, during the fledgling years of talkie cinema, she performed dances during the 15-minute breaks when the reels would be changed by the projectionist. Eventually, she was spotted by a director who cast her in The Return of the Toofan Mail, which was never completed. \n\nYet she had been noticed by film producers in Bombay. Next, she played a westernised vamp in Bhikaran (1935), which became quite a rage with the audience. The influential actor-producer-writer-director Baburao Pendharkar gave her the screen name of Pramila and she was on roll, becoming a much-adored star, albeit stereotyped as a ‘bad girl’ with Ulti Ganga, claimed to be the first version of Mother India, and Jungle King, Jhankar, Our Darling Daughter, Maha Maya, Basant, Bekasoor and more. \n\nHer private life, meanwhile, went through a convoluted  twist in the plot. Suddenly, in 1939, it was announced that she had performed a nikaah with the already-married Shia Muslim Syed Hasan Ali Zaidi, whose screen name was Kumar (still remembered as the rebellious sculptor of Mughal-E-Azam (1960). \n\nShe changed her name to Shabnam Begum Ali in the nikhahnama, but did not give up her Jewish faith. The couple were together for 22 years in the course of which they lived lavishly - regulars at the ballroom of the Taj Mahal Hotel, given to fast cars and betting recklessly at the Mahalaxmi race course. From all accounts, she received tempting offers from Hollywood, which could not fructify because of the outbreak of World War 11. \n\nThe couple had four children: Akbar, Asghar, Naqi and Haider who were encouraged to follow the tenets of both Muslims and Jews. Quite ironically in retrospect, when she was pregnant with her fifth child, Eshter had received the Miss India trophy from Morarji Desai at a ceremony conducted at the Liberty Cinema. All seemed to be going well with the marriage, till Kumar decided to move to Pakistan to seek a more flourishing acting career there. Pramila refused to leave India without a second thought, and continued to act at the Bombay studios right till the completion of Murad (1964).\n\nWith her advancing years, roles dried up. Fortunately she had managed to acquire a home in Shivaji Park for her extended family. Consistently unfazed, she next attempted to launch her daughter Naqi Jahan in show business. The statuesque Naqi became a much-in-demand model and acted in three films Aakhri Khat (1966) - one of the early films of Rajesh Khanna directed by Chetan Anand, Samaj ko Badal Dalo (1970) and Ek Khilari Baawan Pattey (1972). \n\nDisenchanted with the glamour world, the daughter married Viram Kamdar, the owner of the Kamdar Furniture Stores at Churchgate and changed her name to Nandini. Of the five children of Pramila, Haidar remained supportive to his mother in order to run the kitchen fires. He became a stand-up comedian for a while, appeared in TV series and went on to write the screenplay of the Hritihik Roshan-Aishwarya Rai blockbuster Jodhaa Akbar (2008), in which he also essayed the role of a Sufi saint. \n\nIn an interview, Haidar has stated, “My mother was gifted by God with internal power and strength. On the home front, she kept the family together through the toughest times”. Five months short of her 90th birthday, she passed away in 2006 and was buried in Jewish cemetery. \n\nTo be sure, the curious story of Esther Victoria Abraham/Pramila has been sufficiently chronicled, especially on niche websites. Yet how many of us, across generations, have accorded her the status of a truly independent achiever? After all, she stands out to date for her unwavering belief in secularism, for her dedication as a housemaker - who was also a film star and producer and above all, a feminist to the core. If she doesn’t deserve a biopic or web series, who does?\n\n[Source](https://thedailyeye.info/post.php?id=172d5726718f4be8)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rs35jk'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rs35jk/the_incredible_story_of_indias_first_miss_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Empire || Ch 2: Mathura Kanda || 2.2. Pavel Morozov'<br />Body: '*“The hand dexterous in grasping the halfa grass, fuel and stones, ladle, melted butter and the oblation vessel, unsheathed a flaming sword, eager to conquer the earth.”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/16/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**—2.2. Pavel Morozov—**\n\nThis message is sent in confidence, by a Gandharan *arya*, wise beyond his years and your well-wisher – O Queen Gritachi of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose beauty is equated by no other maiden of any race in any of the three worlds, whose auspicious birth was heralded by the great sages of the Aryas as prophetic of a great conqueror from Strirajya \\[1\\] and by the sages of the Western tribes as the reincarnation of the Great Queen Tahm-Rayish the vanquisher of the Persians.\n\nBeware your friends, young princess!\n\nBeware, young princess, of those who demand a right to your trust for they are of the same bloodline!\n\nAs the dynastic light of a most illustrious Scythian line, you have been taught by your family to beware your enemies – but I, who am neither your relation nor your enemy, tell you to beware of both.\n\nIt is foolish for you to celebrate the rise in ranks of your sister Kripa and the presence that she has made in Kamboja.\n\nIn truth, she is only seizing what is rightfully yours, young princess!\n\nIf this thought is too painful or offensive for you to hold, then take that as proof of my words, as proof that those you call your own have enslaved your mind even without enslaving you, that each of them use your abilities towards their ends without heed to those capacities of yours that serve your own ambitions.\n\nProve me wrong! Prove that you have not been enslaved so like other naïve princes and princesses!\n\nThe other Scythian tribes have pushed yours South of the Oxus River, and in your new home you are displaced by the Bactrians who seek to reclaim the land that was once theirs. If your sister Kripa claims Kamboja for herself, then you may assume that she will take the whole of Aryavarta for herself. You will have nowhere to go, nothing to rule, no legacy to claim.\n\nYou are the prophesied conqueror of all the countries East of the Indus river – do not allow your sister to take this title for herself. Your name is one that ought to be recited by the bards of history for as long as men’s tongues last – do not allow it to be forgotten. For prophecies are made true by your own actions, and the lazy do not have prophecies written about them.\n\nConsider your options carefully and wisely, and seek out opportunities to avail, or make them yourself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Or a spy may tell a self-confident son of the chief of mercenary corporations: "You are the son of such and such a king and are kept here under the apprehension of danger from enemies." When he is deluded with this belief, the conqueror may help him with men and money and set him against the mercenary corporations. When the object in view is realised, the conqueror may also banish him.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 11.1:31\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHear, hear!\n\nHear, Kambojas! Hear, residents of the town of Avarana!\n\nOur country is said to be the most beautiful of all countries in the world, its men are said to be the most noble and its women to be the most beautiful in all three worlds, and both are the most skilled in their respective arts and such pursuits – this is held by the Indians and Iranians alike, that we are the most exemplary of Aryas.\n\nYet they continue to treat our country as a commercial article for their enjoyment, as subject to their rule, not to be afforded any independence of our own.\n\nFar too long has Taxila enjoyed a special autonomy under the Persians. As a result of this accord, the Gandharas have grown closer to the Persians than they are to the Kambojas, their own brothers in blood!\n\nUnacceptable! says the noble Prince Subala of Taxila from whom this message is relayed to you.\n\nEither the Gandharas shall be placed under the same rule as the Kambojas are – or the Kambojas shall be elevated to the same status as the Gandharas enjoy. No longer must the Kambojas tolerate this differential treatment from the Persians, this subjugation of our people to a distant king with whom we share few bonds.\n\nPrince Subala is intelligent and brave, he has the endorsement of many great scholars even as they are too afraid to pronounce their endorsement publicly. He is affected towards a Kamboja maiden, the apsara Sukeshi, and he has married her in the Gandharva style \\[2\\], for this he has been disowned by King Ambhi, his father, and for this reason he has rebelled.\n\nYour most blessed town has been selected by Prince Subala as the location for a fort of his construction. He seeks your support in his secession from Taxila and promises you far better treatment than what you have been given by the Persians, he promises you a kingdom that has the strength to stand for interests, that is not merely at the mercy of the Persians.\n\nTo this end, he has already secured the support of the powerful King Purushottama of the Vrishnis, the mightiest enemy of the Persians, and of the mighty Queen Kripa of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose tribe is known for having vanquished the Persians and beheaded the emperor Koorush many centuries prior. Each of these allies has been prophesied to be great conquerors and liberators, and they are the natural allies of a people of such dignity and stature as the Kambojas.\n\nThe residents of Avarana are directed to start building a great fort for Prince Subala – directors will be dispatched to employ craftsmen, builders, guards, mercenaries and servants for this purpose. Those who co-operate with the prince will be rewarded handsomely for their efforts, both individually and via their service to a Kamboja victory – for Prince Subala is not short on wealth nor on his capacity to acquire it from his enemies. And those who act as traitors to the cause of the Kambojas, who refuse to provide their labour for the Kamboja cause, will be regarded as such, and will be punished by the gods for their betrayal.\n\nRejoice, noble Kambojas! For today marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Kambojas, an era in which we shall reclaim that glory which has been so wrongfully seized from us. Salute Prince Subala, for he is the saviour that you have been awaiting, the hero of ancient prophecies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*\\[In Sakala\\] the women, drunk and naked, laugh and dance outdoors in the city; unadorned with garlands or unguents, they drunkenly sing various obscene songs that are as musical as a donkey’s bray or a camel’s bleat. They are without restraint in intercourse as in all other matters; in drunken madness they call each other various endearing epithets. Making drunk cries to their husbands, these fallen women give themselves up to dancing without observing restrictions even on sacred days.*\n\n*What man would willingly dwell, even for a moment, among these fallen, depraved Valhikas?*\n\n*Crossing the Sutlej, returning to my own country, I await to cast my eyes again upon the beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing stickers of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium on their eyes!*\n\n—Mahabharata 8.44\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The men who inhabit the Hindu-Kush have intercourse with the women in the open.*\n\n—Megasthenes, according to Strabo 15.1.56, also corroborated by Herodotus 3.101\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The wives prostitute themselves unless they are compelled to be chaste.*\n\n—Megasthenes, according to Strabo 15.1.54\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was with scrunched-up noses that the duo exited Sakala.\n\nThey had had never any interest in participating in the city’s barbarian depravities and orgies, its unrestrained pursuit of low pleasures – yet they had to rest their horses, for the Northern Highway was in shambles and without any safe resting places, brought to ruin by the repeated warring and lack of co-ordination between the Ayudhajivi states; and Sakala was the only stop where they could have safely rested, for Shuktimati was ruled by King Purushottama, an enemy of the Gandharas, and the cities of Prasthala, Upaplavya and further were much too war-like with drunken brawling and chaotic and lavish displays of culture through public song and dance.\n\nOf course, these cities were, on average, some of the safest cities of the world – not despite, but as a result, of their being heavily-armed. But for special visitors without the funds to employ bodyguards, this would also have made a well-funded assassination rather trivial.\n\nIt was in the evening that Professor Chanakya released the pigeon that they had been carrying for so long.\n\n“What is that, Professor?” asked Chandragupta – no, *Shashigupta*, as Chanakya had instructed him to completely play the part of his new identity.\n\nThe Professor took a long time to answer, and when he did, he simply said: “A letter.”\n\nShashigupta knew better than to press further.\n\nThey stared into the fire.\n\n“That’s the disadvantage of lacking Pabbata’s company, isn’t it?” Shashigupta commented, “We cannot simply rely on the threat of Magadhan might for our protection.”\n\nChanakya smiled wryly. “Is that how you see your master, Shashigupta? That his function is that of a mere bodyguard to you?”\n\nEven as Shashigupta was quite certain of what Chanakya’s intentions were, and he trusted his Professor quite entirely, to hear such an accusation, made even in jest, sent a jolt of terror through his body. He laughed weakly.\n\nSilence ensued for some time longer.\n\n“There is a question I must ask you,” said Chanakya. “What is the nature of your loyalty to Pabbata?”\n\nShashigupta inhaled deeply with dread, having known for far too long that this question would eventually be asked of him – if not by his Professor, then by himself. And in truth, he did not even know if it was that he did not know the answer, or that his mind simply refused to entertain that mode of thinking.\n\n“What is of primary concern to you?” Chanakya continued, “His interests, or his agency? That is to say, would you be willing to keep secrets from him, or to disobey his orders, should I judge that this were in the prince’s own interests?”\n\n“I must ask what such situation you believe my arise,” Shashigupta questioned. “That you believe Pabbata would act in a way that is contrary to his own interests, and that this will require an intervention on my part?”\n\nThe Professor’s face was grim.\n\n“There are many excellent qualities in Pabbata,” Chanakya admitted. “Qualities that make him fit to be king. And yet, I worry about his suspicious mind – that his suspicions of me may cause him to act rashly, or to forgo crucial opportunities because of the risk of betrayal. I can only hope that he will trust me at least when I make him king – for what more could I give him to win his trust?”\n\nChanakya’s words were manipulative – Shashigupta recognized that much, for his Professor was not one to *only hope* for anything; he was the sort to make plans, or to alter made plans, to ensure that a desirable outcome occurred. He did not comment on that, however.\n\n“I will say this much, Professor,” said Shashigupta, “For whatever you demand of me, I shall assess the prospects, and my trust in you, independently of what Pabbata thinks. For if you believe that his mind is biased against you, then it falls upon me as his loyal companion to be the voice of reason to counter that bias.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*By way of collecting his wandering thoughts into a resolve, the king exhibits in his appearance and movements his inclination, anger, pleasure, sorrow, determination, fear, and change in the pairs of opposite feelings. These are the signs of the king’s satisfaction with a courtier (and the reverse indicates displeasure):*\n\n*"By cognising wisdom in others, he is pleased; he is attentive to others’ speech; he gives a seat; he allows himself to be met privately; he is not suspicious; he enjoys conversation; he spontaneously looks to things without reminder; he is tolerant of rational argument; he issues orders with a smile; he touches with the hand; he does not laugh at what is commendable; he commends the qualities of another behind him; he consults the courtier during meals, sports and when in trouble; increasingly honours the courtier and his followers and averts his troubles; shares secrets with him.”*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.5:7-10\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and fifty-eight years ago.*\n\n*The coronation speech of King Ajatashatru.*\n\n*\\[The king, drunk and dishevelled, stumbles onto the lectern, and drops a clay pot onto the floor behind him before resting his arms on the back of the throne. The crowd watches him intensely, slightly uncomfortable, slightly confused and slightly petrified. Gradually, he raises one hand into the air and lets out a bored cry.\\]*\n\n*Ah, yes – thank you! Thank you … to who? Yes … to me! From all your wives! You impotent husbands of prostitutes.*\n\n*No, that is not what I meant to say. But it is true. You know what else is true? Dirghalochana sings as he bathes! He says they are holy chants, but the Ajivikas do not have holy chants, do they? And even if they did, I am sure he is just inclined towards music and being merry. You know who else was inclined towards music and being merry? My father! And he is dead now!*\n\n*\\[The king laughs uncontrollably for a full half-minute. The crowd is frozen in shock, and Dirghalochana is trembling..\\]*\n\n*I jest, I jest – he’s just in prison..*\n\n*Oh yes … that reminds me … my father … I wanted to do something to him.*\n\n*Kill him? No, not yet.*\n\n*Torture him? I’m already doing that.*\n\n*Thank him! Ah yes … that’s what I wanted to say.*\n\n*Thank you, Father, O mighty King Bimbisara, the former Lord of the Magadhas – for if not for your seed I would not exist. But then again, neither would my idiot brothers, so is that truly so bad? Yes it is, I am simply that important. No, that’s not why I wanted to thank him. But I must say I do not resemble my father in the slightest. Is there something I must know, Mother? Was there a more intelligent, less lazy Vaishali man than my father? I mean, yes, all of them, but I am not certain when you would have had the time to commit such an atrocity—*\n\n*\\[The king makes an obscene gesture.\\]*\n\n*—however justifiable it may be, to circumcise my father so. From what I know, he did nothing but laze and frolick with his wives like a depraved dog until I urged him to invade Anga.*\n\n*Yes! That is what I wanted to thank him for. For conquering Anga! Even though it was I who did so, truly. Forgive me, Vapushmati, my queen – I did not wish to slay your family so, I did not wish you to be treated in the manner you were – although I did wish to treat you in such manner. Which I did.*\n\n*\\[The king laughs. The queen makes a shy gesture to protect the image of her chastity. A courtier laughs along with the king, and is beheaded on the spot.\\]*\n\n*Yes, thank you, father!–Can you hear me from your prison?– for crushing all those petty rebellions. For conquering all those petty tribes. So I can focus on the real task at hand: the conquest of all India!*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known; revealing the names of traitors after receiving information from spies specially employed to find out such men; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others when information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.1:2\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA speech, from Shashigupta of Taxila to the Arjunayanas.\n\nI salute you, Vrishniman, the chief of the mighty Arjunayanas, the worthy claimants to the legacy of the mighty Arjuna, of the Kuru line of antiquity – the blessed of the defenders of the Kshatriya Dharma, who are honoured for their quality that a Brahmin need not tell them twice for them to understand the truth and execute the correct action.

As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations.

Pavel Morozov—**\n\nThis message is sent in confidence, by a Gandharan *arya*, wise beyond his years and your well-wisher – O Queen Gritachi of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose beauty is equated by no other maiden of any race in any of the three worlds, whose auspicious birth was heralded by the great sages of the Aryas as prophetic of a great conqueror from Strirajya \\[1\\] and by the sages of the Western tribes as the reincarnation of the Great Queen Tahm-Rayish the vanquisher of the Persians.\n\nBeware your friends, young princess!\n\nBeware, young princess, of those who demand a right to your trust for they are of the same bloodline!\n\nAs the dynastic light of a most illustrious Scythian line, you have been taught by your family to beware your enemies – but I, who am neither your relation nor your enemy, tell you to beware of both.\n\nIt is foolish for you to celebrate the rise in ranks of your sister Kripa and the presence that she has made in Kamboja.\n\nIn truth, she is only seizing what is rightfully yours, young princess!\n\nIf this thought is too painful or offensive for you to hold, then take that as proof of my words, as proof that those you call your own have enslaved your mind even without enslaving you, that each of them use your abilities towards their ends without heed to those capacities of yours that serve your own ambitions. \n\nProve me wrong! Prove that you have not been enslaved so like other naïve princes and princesses!\n\nThe other Scythian tribes have pushed yours South of the Oxus River, and in your new home you are displaced by the Bactrians who seek to reclaim the land that was once theirs. If your sister Kripa claims Kamboja for herself, then you may assume that she will take the whole of Aryavarta for herself. You will have nowhere to go, nothing to rule, no legacy to claim.\n\nYou are the prophesied conqueror of all the countries East of the Indus river – do not allow your sister to take this title for herself. Your name is one that ought to be recited by the bards of history for as long as men’s tongues last – do not allow it to be forgotten. For prophecies are made true by your own actions, and the lazy do not have prophecies written about them.\n\nConsider your options carefully and wisely, and seek out opportunities to avail, or make them yourself. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Or a spy may tell a self-confident son of the chief of mercenary corporations: "You are the son of such and such a king and are kept here under the apprehension of danger from enemies." When he is deluded with this belief, the conqueror may help him with men and money and set him against the mercenary corporations. When the object in view is realised, the conqueror may also banish him.* \n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 11.1:31\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHear, hear!\n\nHear, Kambojas! Hear, residents of the town of Avarana!\n\nOur country is said to be the most beautiful of all countries in the world, its men are said to be the most noble and its women to be the most beautiful in all three worlds, and both are the most skilled in their respective arts and such pursuits – this is held by the Indians and Iranians alike, that we are the most exemplary of Aryas. \n\nYet they continue to treat our country as a commercial article for their enjoyment, as subject to their rule, not to be afforded any independence of our own.\n\nFar too long has Taxila enjoyed a special autonomy under the Persians. As a result of this accord, the Gandharas have grown closer to the Persians than they are to the Kambojas, their own brothers in blood!\n\nUnacceptable! says the noble Prince Subala of Taxila from whom this message is relayed to you.\n\nEither the Gandharas shall be placed under the same rule as the Kambojas are – or the Kambojas shall be elevated to the same status as the Gandharas enjoy. No longer must the Kambojas tolerate this differential treatment from the Persians, this subjugation of our people to a distant king with whom we share few bonds. \n\nPrince Subala is intelligent and brave, he has the endorsement of many great scholars even as they are too afraid to pronounce their endorsement publicly. He is affected towards a Kamboja maiden, the apsara Sukeshi, and he has married her in the Gandharva style \\[2\\], for this he has been disowned by King Ambhi, his father, and for this reason he has rebelled. \n\nYour most blessed town has been selected by Prince Subala as the location for a fort of his construction. He seeks your support in his secession from Taxila and promises you far better treatment than what you have been given by the Persians, he promises you a kingdom that has the strength to stand for interests, that is not merely at the mercy of the Persians.\n\nTo this end, he has already secured the support of the powerful King Purushottama of the Vrishnis, the mightiest enemy of the Persians, and of the mighty Queen Kripa of the Matsyaka Scythians, whose tribe is known for having vanquished the Persians and beheaded the emperor Koorush many centuries prior. Each of these allies has been prophesied to be great conquerors and liberators, and they are the natural allies of a people of such dignity and stature as the Kambojas. \n\nThe residents of Avarana are directed to start building a great fort for Prince Subala – directors will be dispatched to employ craftsmen, builders, guards, mercenaries and servants for this purpose. Those who co-operate with the prince will be rewarded handsomely for their efforts, both individually and via their service to a Kamboja victory – for Prince Subala is not short on wealth nor on his capacity to acquire it from his enemies. And those who act as traitors to the cause of the Kambojas, who refuse to provide their labour for the Kamboja cause, will be regarded as such, and will be punished by the gods for their betrayal.\n\nRejoice, noble Kambojas! For today marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Kambojas, an era in which we shall reclaim that glory which has been so wrongfully seized from us. Salute Prince Subala, for he is the saviour that you have been awaiting, the hero of ancient prophecies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*\\[In Sakala\\] the women, drunk and naked, laugh and dance outdoors in the city; unadorned with garlands or unguents, they drunkenly sing various obscene songs that are as musical as a donkey’s bray or a camel’s bleat. They are without restraint in intercourse as in all other matters; in drunken madness they call each other various endearing epithets. Making drunk cries to their husbands, these fallen women give themselves up to dancing without observing restrictions even on sacred days.*\n\n*What man would willingly dwell, even for a moment, among these fallen, depraved Valhikas?*\n\n*Crossing the Sutlej, returning to my own country, I await to cast my eyes again upon the beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing stickers of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium on their eyes!*\n\n—Mahabharata 8.44\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The men who inhabit the Hindu-Kush have intercourse with the women in the open.*\n\n—Megasthenes, according to Strabo 15.1.56, also corroborated by Herodotus 3.101\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The wives prostitute themselves unless they are compelled to be chaste.*\n\n—Megasthenes, according to Strabo 15.1.54\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was with scrunched-up noses that the duo exited Sakala. \n\nThey had had never any interest in participating in the city’s barbarian depravities and orgies, its unrestrained pursuit of low pleasures – yet they had to rest their horses, for the Northern Highway was in shambles and without any safe resting places, brought to ruin by the repeated warring and lack of co-ordination between the Ayudhajivi states; and Sakala was the only stop where they could have safely rested, for Shuktimati was ruled by King Purushottama, an enemy of the Gandharas, and the cities of Prasthala, Upaplavya and further were much too war-like with drunken brawling and chaotic and lavish displays of culture through public song and dance.\n\nOf course, these cities were, on average, some of the safest cities of the world – not despite, but as a result, of their being heavily-armed. But for special visitors without the funds to employ bodyguards, this would also have made a well-funded assassination rather trivial. \n\nIt was in the evening that Professor Chanakya released the pigeon that they had been carrying for so long.\n\n“What is that, Professor?” asked Chandragupta – no, *Shashigupta*, as Chanakya had instructed him to completely play the part of his new identity.\n\nThe Professor took a long time to answer, and when he did, he simply said: “A letter.”\n\nShashigupta knew better than to press further. \n\nThey stared into the fire.\n\n“That’s the disadvantage of lacking Pabbata’s company, isn’t it?” Shashigupta commented, “We cannot simply rely on the threat of Magadhan might for our protection.”\n\nChanakya smiled wryly. “Is that how you see your master, Shashigupta? That his function is that of a mere bodyguard to you?”\n\nEven as Shashigupta was quite certain of what Chanakya’s intentions were, and he trusted his Professor quite entirely, to hear such an accusation, made even in jest, sent a jolt of terror through his body. He laughed weakly.\n\nSilence ensued for some time longer.\n\n“There is a question I must ask you,” said Chanakya. “What is the nature of your loyalty to Pabbata?”\n\nShashigupta inhaled deeply with dread, having known for far too long that this question would eventually be asked of him – if not by his Professor, then by himself. And in truth, he did not even know if it was that he did not know the answer, or that his mind simply refused to entertain that mode of thinking.\n\n“What is of primary concern to you?” Chanakya continued, “His interests, or his agency? That is to say, would you be willing to keep secrets from him, or to disobey his orders, should I judge that this were in the prince’s own interests?” \n\n“I must ask what such situation you believe my arise,” Shashigupta questioned. “That you believe Pabbata would act in a way that is contrary to his own interests, and that this will require an intervention on my part?”\n\nThe Professor’s face was grim.\n\n“There are many excellent qualities in Pabbata,” Chanakya admitted. “Qualities that make him fit to be king. And yet, I worry about his suspicious mind – that his suspicions of me may cause him to act rashly, or to forgo crucial opportunities because of the risk of betrayal. I can only hope that he will trust me at least when I make him king – for what more could I give him to win his trust?”\n\nChanakya’s words were manipulative – Shashigupta recognized that much, for his Professor was not one to *only hope* for anything; he was the sort to make plans, or to alter made plans, to ensure that a desirable outcome occurred. He did not comment on that, however.\n\n“I will say this much, Professor,” said Shashigupta, “For whatever you demand of me, I shall assess the prospects, and my trust in you, independently of what Pabbata thinks. For if you believe that his mind is biased against you, then it falls upon me as his loyal companion to be the voice of reason to counter that bias.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*By way of collecting his wandering thoughts into a resolve, the king exhibits in his appearance and movements his inclination, anger, pleasure, sorrow, determination, fear, and change in the pairs of opposite feelings. These are the signs of the king’s satisfaction with a courtier (and the reverse indicates displeasure):*\n\n*"By cognising wisdom in others, he is pleased; he is attentive to others’ speech; he gives a seat; he allows himself to be met privately; he is not suspicious; he enjoys conversation; he spontaneously looks to things without reminder; he is tolerant of rational argument; he issues orders with a smile; he touches with the hand; he does not laugh at what is commendable; he commends the qualities of another behind him; he consults the courtier during meals, sports and when in trouble; increasingly honours the courtier and his followers and averts his troubles; shares secrets with him.”*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.5:7-10\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and fifty-eight years ago.*\n\n*The coronation speech of King Ajatashatru.*\n\n*\\[The king, drunk and dishevelled, stumbles onto the lectern, and drops a clay pot onto the floor behind him before resting his arms on the back of the throne.

Thank you … to who? Yes … to me! From all your wives! You impotent husbands of prostitutes.*\n\n*No, that is not what I meant to say. But it is true. You know what else is true? Dirghalochana sings as he bathes! He says they are holy chants, but the Ajivikas do not have holy chants, do they? And even if they did, I am sure he is just inclined towards music and being merry.

But then again, neither would my idiot brothers, so is that truly so bad? Yes it is, I am simply that important. No, that’s not why I wanted to thank him. But I must say I do not resemble my father in the slightest. Is there something I must know, Mother? Was there a more intelligent, less lazy Vaishali man than my father? I mean, yes, all of them, but I am not certain when you would have had the time to commit such an atrocity—*\n\n*\\[The king makes an obscene gesture.\\]*\n\n*—however justifiable it may be, to circumcise my father so. From what I know, he did nothing but laze and frolick with his wives like a depraved dog until I urged him to invade Anga.* \n\n*Yes! That is what I wanted to thank him for. For conquering Anga! Even though it was I who did so, truly. Forgive me, Vapushmati, my queen – I did not wish to slay your family so, I did not wish you to be treated in the manner you were – although I did wish to treat you in such manner. Which I did.* \n\n*\\[The king laughs. The queen makes a shy gesture to protect the image of her chastity. A courtier laughs along with the king, and is beheaded on the spot.\\]*\n\n*Yes, thank you, father!–Can you hear me from your prison?– for crushing all those petty rebellions. For conquering all those petty tribes.

      <li>Title::: '"Discovery" of lands as the term is used originated in 1452 Papal Bull“capture &amp; subdue saracens,pagans &amp; enemies of Christ,take their possessions &amp; property". In 1823,Christian Doctrine of Discovery ie "the first Christian to sight new land became its discoverer,hence owner" was adopted into US law'<br />Body: 'Quoted from this OpIndia Article:\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2021/08/discovery-word-meaning-origin-aryabhatt-kadamb/](https://www.opindia.com/2021/08/discovery-word-meaning-origin-aryabhatt-kadamb/)\n\nDiscovery\n\n&gt;This is how Oxford Dictionary defines ‘discovery’.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Discovery (n): an act or the process of finding somebody/something, or learning about something that was not known about before.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Except, the origin of the word are quite different.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In common indoctrinated knowledge an Italian explorer Christopher Columbus discovered America, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon discovered Australia and Portuguese Vasco Da Gama discovered India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Christopher Columbus wanted to discover India but landed in America because he underestimated the size of the earth nearly by 40% and reached Cuba instead. Hence the indigenous people are called Indians. Vasco Da Gama was in Africa for months clueless of passage to India. He discovered India only when an Indian man named ***Kanak*** accompanied and guided him to India. Kanak used a traditional navigational instrument called the ***Kamal*** or ***Rapalagai***. It’s common knowledge that people in these places existed for thousands of years before the sailors from far-off land set their foot for the first time. Then why should it be called ‘Discovery’ even though the place, people, habitat was living, breathing and thriving before the arrival?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here is where things get interesting. But first, let us understand a bit about ‘Papal bull’. What is ‘Papal bull’?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is a formal proclamation issued by the Pope (usually written in antiquated characters and sealed with a leaden bulla). It is a type of decree or an order which is legally binding command or decision entered on the court record (as if issued by a court or judge).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The heathens of the world would be unaware of the real meaning of the term “discovery” as it relates to a religious doctrine enunciated by the church in papal bulls.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the bull of 1452, Pope Nicholas directed King Alfonso to “capture, vanquish, and subdue the saracens, pagans, and other enemies of Christ,” to “put them into perpetual slavery,” and “to take all their possessions and property.” \\[Davenport: 20-26\\] Acting on this papal privilege, Portugal continued to traffic in African slaves and expanded its royal dominions by making “discoveries” along the western coast of Africa, claiming those lands as Portuguese territory. Under various theological and legal doctrines formulated during and after the Crusades, non-Christians were considered enemies of the Catholic faith and, as such, less than human.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When Columbus sailed west across the Sea of Darkness in 1492 – with the express understanding that he was authorized to “take possession” of any lands he “discovered” that were “not under the dominion of any Christian rulers” – he and the Spanish sovereigns of Aragon and Castile were following an already well-established tradition of “discovery” and conquest. \\[Thacher:96\\]. Pope Alexander stated his desire that the “discovered” people be “subjugated and brought to the faith itself.” \\[Davenport:61\\] By this means, said the pope, the “Christian Empire” would be propagated. \\[Thacher:127\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The underlying religious principle was the “Doctrine of Christian Discovery” that the first Christian to sight any piece of land became its ‘discoverer’ hence owner. It is in this sense of land ownership that Vasco da Gama ‘discovered’ India or Columbus ‘discovered’ America.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**When Christopher Columbus first set foot on the white sands of Guanahani island, he performed a ceremony to “take possession” of the land for the king and queen of Spain, acting under the international laws of Western Christendom. The bull** ***Romanus Pontifex*** **explicitly directed all Christians** ***to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans…and other enemies of Christ \\[i.e., all non-Christians\\]…to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery, and to apply and appropriate…\\[their\\] possessions, and goods, and to convert them to…their use and profit…***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**This papal incitement to mass murder was justified by quoting parts of the Bible. “Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron sceptre; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.” \\[Psalm 2:8-9 N.I.V.\\] “May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackled of iron, to carry out the sentence written against them. This is the glory of all his saints. Praise the Lord.” \\[Psalm 149:6-9 N.I.V.\\].**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In his book titled ‘A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies’, Bartolome De Las Casas talks about how the Spanish did not spare even women and children. He says that they split open the wombs of pregnant women and threw young children from cliffs into the sea saying “boil there you offspring of the devil”. Close to 10 million people were brutally murdered in the initial genocide in America.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In 1823, the Christian Doctrine of Discovery was quietly adopted into U.S. law by the Supreme Court in the celebrated case, Johnson v. McIntosh (8 Wheat., 543). Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall observed that Christian European nations had assumed “ultimate dominion” over the lands of America during the Age of Discovery, and that – upon “discovery” – the Indians had lost “their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations,” and only retained a right of “occupancy” in their lands.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In other words, Indians nations were subject to the ultimate authority of the first nation of Christendom to claim possession of a given region of Indian lands. \\[Johnson:574; Wheaton:270-1\\] According to Marshall, the United States – upon winning its independence in 1776 – became a successor nation to the right of “discovery” and acquired the power of “dominion” from Great Britain.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Doctrine of Discovery is the International Law of Colonialism as stated by Professor Robert J. Miller explains in 10 points how this doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring aboriginal possession of land in favor of colonial or post-colonial governments.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;There have been multiple holocausts of natives around the world in name of religious beliefs in the African continent, Native America and the most recent finding of a [mass graves of children](https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/canada-mass-grave-of-215-children-some-as-young-as-3-years-old-discovered-at-a-former-indigenous-residential-school-site/) which is the result of genocide of native people in Canada. Indigenous legal scholar Tamara Starblanket quoted in an article, *“The laws and policies that force our children’s removal are about our lands and how to gain domination over the lands, minerals, waters, and airspace. The government attempted forcible denationalization, … by massive and widespread forcible indoctrination. … The effect is that our children do not understand their responsibilities, languages, cultures, spirituality, laws and direct connection to our lands and their duty to protect our lands for future generations.”*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hitler found his inspiration of Nazi genocide from butcherings of Native Americans. He [quotes](http://primevalvoid.com/written_essays/german/hitlerdebtamerica.html#2) as follows.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is only one task: Germanization through the introduction of Germans \\[to the area\\] and to treat the original inhabitants like Indians. … I intend to stay this course with ice-cold determination. I feel myself to be the executor of the will of History. What people think of me at present is all of no consequence. Never have I heard a German who has bread to eat express concern that the ground where the grain was grown had to be conquered by the sword. We eat Canadian wheat and never think of the Indians.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The once upon a time colonies are still the slaves to the legacy the superior and imperial colonisers have left for generations to come which will still suffer in colonialism despite the independence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is about time we come out of the shackles of colonialism and dig our roots, engage with our true history to ‘*Discover*\\*\\*\\*‘\\*\\*\\* the truth.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bitter truth of ‘Discovery’ is an ugly face of all human vices, but what’s more shameful is we subjugating ourselves to this law even today that dehumanizes all non-christians, strips them of their basic rights to their land thereby still colonizing, a sad reality that most people are unaware of, justification/appropriation of genocides, no punishments, no closure. \n\n# If mere sight of a land or people is with intent to conquest, how do we trust the view of those people to write our history &amp; analyse our present?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_genocide\n\nIndigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:\n\n(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;\n\n(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;\n\n(c) Any form of population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;\n\n(d) Any form of assimilation or integration by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;\n\n(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'rqc9v4'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rqc9v4/discovery_of_lands_as_the_term_is_used_originated/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Resident Doctors in India are on strike'<br />Body: 'On the 27th of December 2021, A large group of doctors from medical institutes around Delhi gathered near MAMC. We were protesting the excruciating delay in the PG counselling and appointment of the new batch of residents in the various Medical and Surgical PG branches throughout India.\n\nOur plan was to march towards the Supreme court, in a peaceful protest. After prior intimation to the relevant authorities and Police, form the all the Resident Doctor’s associations and FORDA, the federation of RDA’s, we began our march towards the supreme court only to be barricaded by the police within 100 meters. \n\nThe road was barricaded and blocked for us. We stayed peacefully where we were while continuously raising slogans. We caused no harm to anyone or any property, while the general public was hailing abuses at us. As per their demeanor, neither the public nor the police knew who we were and what we were protesting for, a testament to the fantastic journalism by major media houses and the union government who have leashed them up so well. \n\nWhy I say this is impressive, it is because we have been in contact with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) since the 27th of November. We have been on protest since the 16th of December – first at our hospitals, then in front of Nirman Bhawan, and now at MAMC.\n\nResident doctors are the backbone of the healthcare system in India. When a patient arrives , the history, workup, diagnosis, sampling, labs, investigations, and treatment are all taken care of by the residents, of course with help from Nurses and other hospital staff but mostly by residents. This means the average resident goes home once every 2 days with only enough time to sleep, after which they must report back to duty. A PG course is 3 years long. With there being no counselling, all this work, that would’ve been handled by 3 batches of doctors, is being done by 2. And now with senior most batch going for exam, it’ll come down to one batch of residents as admission of new residents will take a month or two even after the counselling process begins.\n\nWe’re in the middle of a Pandemic right now. The deaths we saw and the hours we worked were inhumane when the first wave hit us towards the end of Feb 2020. We thought things were getting better, but the 2nd wave was even more devastating with a shortage of oxygen throughout the country, and the loss of family, friends, and colleagues to COVID with not enough ICU beds to admit them. We couldn’t even find beds for ourselves, the people working in the hospital, let alone our families. As a thanks for our efforts, the govt asked the public to bang utensils, a shower of petals at our hospitals and what not, all of this was supposed to be done from home, but the public did more harm than good by flouting social distancing norms and gathering outside, including the election rallies in midst of raging pandemic. All of this when doctors have been facing violence from public for years – which only increased during the pandemic, with doctors facing the brunt of government and system’s failure.\n\nMoHFW truly did a fantastic job by providing free vaccination to the public, and that really did help us in our effort to battle this pandemic, but bad news to those who don’t follow. We’ve got a new variant of SARSCoV2 (the virus causing the disease, COVID-19) – Omicron, it carries a threat of a devastating 3rd wave, and it’s right around the corner. Now you tell me how it makes to take on a pandemic with 2/3rds of your resources?\n\nTherefore, we were on protest. A peaceful protest. But on 27th December, at MAMC, about 4 hours into our protest, the officers of Delhi Police began thrashing us, with lathis and fists. Female doctors were manhandled by policemen and policewomen. The FORDA and RDA members were abused, beaten, and carried away on buses and locked up for a while before being released a few hours later.\n\nThis protest is bigger than just a demand for young residents who’ve worked so hard to get post-graduation seats. We demand respect. We demand the resignation of the police personnel involved in the violence against peacefully protesting doctors. We demand JUSTICE!\n\n\\- A resident of Anaesthesiology and Intensive care at Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi\n\n\\#DoctorStrike #ExpediteNEETPGCounselling'<br />Author: 'LethalShrimp'  id: 'rqauwd'<br />Score:283<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rqauwd/resident_doctors_in_india_are_on_strike/</li>

I have attached some screenshots of our email to the University Ombudsperson.  \n\n\nHere are the mind-blowing things I learnt about her from this post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(1) " Her  family is staunchly Christian. They involve themselves in  proselytization activities in India. Her uncle got thrown out of India  for this reason. Denigrating Hinduism by using legal loopholes available  is an art perfected by missionaries and communists. She is one tentacle  of the missionary system, where she has placed herself as a scholar in  Sanskrit, historian and a woman. She also has many sponsorships from the  Pakistani lobby groups. "\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(2) "Audry Truschke is a member of American Institute of Pakistan Studies (AIPS), which is a Pakistani Lobbying Group. They purged her involvement for her credibility, but archived web histories show her connection\n\n[https://archive.fo/9ew13](https://archive.fo/9ew13) [https://archive.fo/4jW2W](https://archive.fo/4jW2W)\n\nBut this is only part of the overall nexus between Islamists and the Woke Left in the west. Pretty much anything related to Islamic regional disputes, are always portrayed as Muslims are perpetual victims. One of the valid points that everyone makes is the disproportionate terrorist attacks committed by members of the Islamic faith, by bringing in Hindutva (What they claim as Hindu terrorism), they are trying to equate the two and white wash Islamic religious extremism by saying "Hey everyone does it, so you can\'t solely blame Muslims". But Hindu terrorist attacks are extremely rare to the point of nonexistence, and isn\'t even found in any countries with substantial Hindu populations (Suriname, Guyana, South Africa, etc)."  \n\n\n(3) " Exactly! Like this lady needs to shut the fuck up already. There aren’t Indians who become “scholars” of the Alamo or some bullshit and go around lecturing to people. Another loud as fuck Karen in my opinion. "\n\n(4) " Never knew that I admired Hitler lol. Thanks for telling me trashkey.  // No one admires Hitlers. These fake historians claims that Hindutva supporters were influenced by Hitler and Nazi etc. There is no evident claims. These are false with no actual data. "  \n\n\nI hear she has now started some type of thing for protecting oneself against Hindutva people. Does anyone know more about her? Also, what is this thing about protecting people from Hindutva-driven hatred?

      <li>Title::: 'Again, it is that time of the year, are you ready to claim tax deductions?'<br />Body: 'It is that time of the year, employers have started asking for proofs to approve tax deductions. Are you ready to claim tax deductions? Let\'s discuss about the options available.\n\n**HRA**\n\nIf you are staying in a rented house, you should make use of this component. There is virtually no limit for HRA and you can use the calculators provided by your employers (or anything in web) to calculate your applicable limit.\n\n HRA tax exemption is the minimum of the following 3 components:\n\n* total HRA as per salary slip\n* 40% (or 50% of basic, if you stay in "metro" cities) of your basic\n* actual rent paid - 10% basic\n\nSo if your HRA component is high and rent is equally high, your HRA exemption increases proportionately. It completely depends on one\'s pay structure\n\n**Food, Fuel &amp; Mobile reimbursements/coupons.**\n\nThis generally comes around 6-7K per month and you can claim close to 72-84K in tax exemptions.\n\n**80C - Insurance &amp; Investments - 1.5L**\n\nLife Insurance Policies, 5 year FD, ELSS Funds, PPF, VPF, EPF/NPS are generally covered, in addition to ULIPs. Most of us utilize this to maximum.\n\n**80 CCD(1B) - NPS - 50K**\n\nInvesting in NPS Tier 1 will get us another 50K in tax deductions, but lot of people are against NPS as it has 40% mandatory component.\n\n**80 CCD(2) - Corporate NPS - upto 7.5L**\n\nThis is different from General NPS mentioned above. Corporate NPS can save taxes over and above General NPS. Lot of people are not aware of it and sometime gets confused with it.\n\nFor Corporate NPS, amount should be routed through employer like how we do for EPF.  You just need to talk to your employer and set up a direct debit to NPS from your salary. \n\nLot of employers provide portal to manage salary structure and you can do this in few clicks. \n\nYou can contribute upto 10% of your salary towards corporate NPS and contribution upto 7.5L through this route is tax deduction. This contribution falls under 80CCD(2). Limit is 7.5 Lakhs per year.\n\n**80 D - Health Insurance - 75K**\n\nIt is split into 2 components.\n\n1. You can claim a deduction up to ₹25,000 per year for health insurance premiums\n2. If you have senior citizen parents and are paying premiums for them, you can claim an additional deduction of ₹50,000 for this.\n\nIn total, you get 75K tax excemption.\n\n**80 DDB - Medical Treatment - 40-100K**\n\nDeduction on expenditure incurred for the treatment of dependent family members for diseases can be claimed under this. The ceiling for this deduction is ₹40,000 which goes to ₹100,000 for senior citizens.\n\n**80 G - Donations**\n\nThe deduction can be 100% of the amount contributed or 50% of the amount contributed depending on the type of institution you have donated to.\n\nThere are lot of options on this front. Ask the organisation you have contributed to for an 80G certificate in order to substantiate your claim.\n\n**80 E - Education Loan Interest**\n\nThere is no upper ceiling on the deduction. You should obtain a statement from your bank showing the breakup of the principal repayment and the interest for the loan. Note only the Interest on education loan is deductible.\n\n**Lastly, Housing Loan**\n\nA home/housing loan must be taken for the purchase/construction of a house. If it is taken for construction of house, then it must be completed within five years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken.\n\nIf you are paying EMI for the housing loan, it has two components –\n\n* Interest payment - The interest portion of the EMI paid for the year can be claimed as a deduction from your total income up to a maximum of Rs 2 lakh under Section 24B.\xa0\n* Principal repayment -  The principal portion of the EMI paid for the year is allowed as a deduction under Section 80C. The maximum amount that can be claimed is up to Rs 1.5 lakh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Note,**\n\nHave you submitted your proofs for this year? Are there any other options that I have missed? What are the one you generally use and the one you generally avoid and why? Let\'s have healthy discussion around this.\n\nNote: \n\n1. Even if you don\'t submit your proofs to employers, you can submit it later while filing ITR and can claim refunds. But always prefer the easy route.\n2. Don\'t invest to save tax. Structure your investment in such a way that tax benefits are just another additional perk.'<br />Author: 'reddituserhere6'  id: 'rq4y1q'<br />Score:38<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rq4y1q/again_it_is_that_time_of_the_year_are_you_ready/</li>

Camera shows a house and devi is entering into it. it stays outside. we are only hearing some voices and ambient noice. we see that a lady opens the door for Richa Chaddha..she is most probably the decesed guy\'s mother. she takes her inside and that guy\'s father meets her. this is happening inside the house and camera is still outside...not following the actors...Richa introduces herself and we hear a man slapping her and shouting and crying.."what was his mistake..what wrong did he do to you"...guy\'s mother is trying to stop the gentleman..and the scene fades...camera is still outside...as if it is scared to face the parents of the decesed guy...Richa\'s character is shown stronger than that camera..camera, which is supoosed to be omni-present\n\nIt reminds me of that beautiful scene from Martin Scorcece\'s masterpiece \'The Taxi driver\'. There is also a similar scene where Robert De Niro\'s character is talking to her lady love over a public phone..the lady is leaving him and he is begging her not to do so..in this scene, the camera tilts away from the character and starts looking at an empty alley...as if its shy and embarassed and doesnt want to see its hero in such a low and embarrassing state.\n\nNo...Masaan didnt copy anything from Taxi Driver...its the maker’s creativity…i would give full credit to the director, writer, and cameraman for giving us such a legendry climax scene...which is flat in nature but is brimming with emotions.\n\nMasaan is a masterpiece in modern Indian cinema.'<br />Author: 'mahdaddy11'  id: 'rp2i8h'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rp2i8h/filmy_rant_masaan_climax_scene/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Identity Crisis of Middle India'<br />Body: 'It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.\n\nOne of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.\n\nWe have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.\n\nCulturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.\n\nSocially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.\n\nThe Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.\n\nAnd so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?\n\nEveryone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?\n\nNehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.\n\nWhen I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.\n\nOne worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.\n\nA young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.\n\nThe real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation. The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.\n\nOne of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because she is culturally American. She identifies as one of them, never mind that she in all probability seen as an outsider by her own constituency. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?\n\nThe youth of this nation cannot even identify with the one billion Indians who are their countrymen because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mother tongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.\n\n**TL;DR - Our urban youth emigrate because they are culturally American and do not even identify themselves as Indian anymore.**'<br />Author: 'conqueror_of_destiny'  id: 'rov47c'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rov47c/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/</li>

I believe he can be a great thing to happen to Punjab if it does happen. He will have the full state, with anti-corruption departments and police under him. I remember the first couple of months of his govt. in Delhi where corrupt people were actually scared, and then the anti-corruption branch was taken away from him. Punjab has a lot of low hanging fruits that a slightly more honest/more educated leader can make a huge difference in a short timeframe. \n\nI really don’t think that either congress, BJP or Akali have any chance of making a difference to Punjab, although I have some hope in Amarinder Singh. \n\nI’ll hate it if Kejriwal collaborates with that Joker Navjot Sidhu in any way. \n\nPlease note: I don’t follow any political party..I am just hoping that some disruption, something new does happen in Punjab.

      <li>Title::: 'On his birth anniversary, let’s remember how Vajpayee made India into an openly declared nuclear power with one of the most secretive and efficient military operations in Indian history'<br />Body: 'The international reaction was nothing short of inflammatory, with promises of embargo and sanctions flying left right and centre. But Vajpayee stood firm through it all and saw that India stand tall and proud as a nuclear power.\n\nIt’s sounds like a far-fetched story, because of the hoodwinking, the cloak and dagger and all the smoke and all the mirrors in the world. It is jarring to see such competence by an Indian Prime Minister, especially after the whole Morarji Desai fiasco, where he basically gave away the secret that India was developing a nuclear weapon. That to0, to the General Zia Ul Haq himself! It led to the deaths of thousands of deep implanted R and AW agents within Pakistan. \n\n**Then was the debacle of 1995 when the previous Congress Prime Minister, PVNR  wanted to conduct the tests, but the details were leaked and the world powers, especially USA put its foot down to backtrack Indian intentions.** There were no further nuclear tests after 1995 until 1998.\n\nIt was therefore paramount to not let even the rumours of a nuclear test leak, because the superpowers would react reflexively. That would require pure intent on keeping operations secure and secret from the Prime Minister’s office to the army soldier who is working on the ground preparing the terrain for the test. All levels delivered. The intent was there and so was confidence in keeping it a secret.\n\nVajpayee, unlike his predecessors, was very straight about India becoming a country that valued national security. He openly said –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**"There is no compromise on national security. We will exercise all options including nuclear options to protect security and sovereignty,"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Vajpayee government delivered on its promise and somehow maintained the sanctity of operational security, and the world came to know about the second Pokhran tests only after they were conducted. \n\nIf it was embarrassing for Pakistan, which was a few hundred kilometres Northwest, that it didn’t have any idea of it all, it must have been a subject of plain ridicule for the CIA, that was snooping on the whole world with their military satellites.\n\nNo one had an idea of what went on, and all the people involved jumped through many a blazing hoops to make this “Operation Shakti” successful. We will take a look at them one by one –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The charge of building an infrastructure to conduct a nuclear test underground was given to 58th Engineering Regiment of the Indian Army – \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The shaft Kumbhakaran that held the third of the five nuclear devices.](https://preview.redd.it/17wdrmeeqo781.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=531810e96afdd0ba6c9d43fd4c6fa7dc7073c5fb)\n\nThe USA had exceptional satellite tracking abilities even then. Many experts suggest that the technologies that we use today were in US military use a few decades ago. Either way, the Indian Army was very aware of USA’s capabilities to spy through satellites. So they took the proper precautions -\n\nDecoy security gates were set up. Watch duty was set up to portray boring routine, as most military day-today operations are.\n\nWork on the nuclear site was only done in the night. Somehow India knew that the American satellites did not have the ability to track objects during night time. There was concern about infrared capabilities and heat detection, but that was taken care of too.\n\nAll the tracks of personnel and equipment were sanitized by the daybreak. That included even tiny footsteps! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1ydpvu94ro781...*\n\nBecause the test was underground, the army had to come up with novel ideas to drain the groundwater after digging the shaft for the nuclear bomb. That took additional laying of water pipes to transport the water to an undisclosed location. Usually they would just drain the water at ground level but that would change the colour of the sand and the satellites would detect that.\n\nThat’s exactly how the satellites detected that the India wanted to perform a nuclear test in 1995. They had somehow found out that the Indian army was working to empty an underground shaft. It only took half a day!\n\nAll this activity would obviously require personnel at the site, so they used to play cricket to fool the satellites. \n\nIn the end, it took a week to complete the whole operation. That was a record time, because each of the 5 shafts were 150 feet deep and filled with sand on top of the nuclear bombs. **Around 180 tonnes of sand were used to fill these shafts, and none of the spy satellites picked it up over the week.**\n\nIt’s interesting to note that all the shafts and the surrounding areas were planted with native shrubs to provide natural camouflage. Ingenious and completely thorough.\n\n# Civilian scientists dressed up as regular army officers and travelled by public transport to avoid suspicion –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Rajagopala Chidambaram, the head of Department of Atomic Energy, holding the file. To his right is Kalam and K Santhanam was the lead supervisor for the preparation of the site standing behind Chidambaram](https://preview.redd.it/4oe69h5jqo781.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d71fc45a99819dee1cbf9e292513deeabfde987)\n\nAPJ Abdul Kalam was the scientific advisor to Vajpayee for the tests. Vajpayee had offered Kalam a cabinet post, but Kalam denied it, saying he wanted to develop the nuclear project further. Vajpayee then convinced him to spearhead Operation Shakti. \n\nKalam agreed and tasked the most trusted DRDO scientists to oversee the whole operation in conjunction with the Army. \n\nBecause the scientists would have to travel to the site to supervise the progress on a regular basis, they disguised themselves as regular Army officers with the proper insignia and dress code. \n\nThis obviously worked because no foreign agent, Pakistani or otherwise detected the presence of civilian scientists at Pokhran. It was regular business as usual, with regular army officers turning up. \n\nThey also made sure that they travelled in public transports, rather than take exclusive transport, since that would get the alarm bells ringing. \n\nOn 11 May 1998, India finally conducted the tests. The biggest bomb was a 200 kilotonne yield nuclear device and the smallest was a 0.2 KT thermonuclear device. All tests were successful.\n\n**The biggest bomb was detonated in the White House. That was the name given to the shaft in which it was detonated.**\n\n**The second shaft was named Taj Mahal, and the third shaft was named Kumbhakaran.** The rest of the low yield shafts were codenamed NT 1, 2 and 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# That was not the end of it. Vajpayee followed it up with a show of strength and went on to a press conference and announced the tests themselves –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f19qz54hro781.jpg?width=162&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273ffe71bd1ea9d8732832ce1bf4133e93a72744\n\n"I have an announcement to make: today at 3:45 p.m., India conducted three underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran range (in Rajasthan state). These were contained explosions like the experiment conducted in May 1974.”\n\nHe also didn’t shy away from calling this military operations, quite unlike Indira Gandhi, who termed her nuclear test, a peaceful test. No such minced words by Vajpayee. He was very clear about India’s intention to project strength.\n\nA special mention has to be for the then Defence Minister George Fernandes, who, despite being a socialist, condemned China and called them India’s enemy number one. He made sure that the operation went smoothly too.\n\nIn the end, Vajpayee and his whole team sealed India’s membership in the exclusive nuclear club and made Pakistan and China very wary of India’s actual capabilities.\n\nThe international reaction was nothing short of inflammatory, with promises of embargos and sanctions flying left right and centre. But Vajpayee stood firm through it all and saw that India stand tall and proud as a nuclear power.\n\nOn his birth anniversary today, we bow down to him.\n\nPranam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources – \n\nThe commander of 58th Engineering Regiment narrates the nitty gritty of the operation – \n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/camouflage-cricket-and-sandy-cues/articleshow/64991434.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/camouflage-cricket-and-sandy-cues/articleshow/64991434.cms)\n\nThe complete political scenario before the tests, the detail of the tests and the after math in this excellent article – \n\n[https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html](https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaShakti.html)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'ro9dku'<br />Score:281<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ro9dku/on_his_birth_anniversary_lets_remember_how/</li>

Why do people have to be racist?\n\nAnyway, here we go:\n\n"December 23, 2021  My dear Ayyappa Bhakti   This is not a poison pen letter in the usual sense — for I have typed it with my innocuous fingers. Rather call this a letter from “a concerned gentleman” — perhaps you\'d be interested to know that success eludes the men who set their goals too low.  It is no secret that browns are some of the most misogynistic people on Earth. They\'re even worse than bl\\*cks in large numbers. Search about the unmentionable vitiation and atrocities against girls and women going on in your nation. Bl\\*cks will be satisfied with less pretty or fatter white women. However, nah....browns want the best of the best - slim, blue-eyed blondes! I am baffled by their temerity.  I can state that from my own personal experience. There are some good looking white girls of Italian descent in my office, though they have olive skin, dark hair and brown eyes. However the curry-munching browns (whose favourite pastime is scamming the elderly and senile out of their money) ignore them and make a beeline straight for the woman who is fair, blue-eyed and blonde......which makes me really furious! Little do they know that female snakes are the only females that they are capable of charming.  I rang up customer service at Microsoft last week and the call was intercepted by a perfidious Sambo fraud. The conversation went like this-  "Heddo, my name is Ann Mary Daniel. \'Ow can I \'elp you" "Don\'t you mean Ann Marie Daniel?" "No, I mean Ann Mary. I am a \\[redacted\\] in \\[redacted\\] like you." "Uh-huh. You sure it\'s not Mary Ann?" "No, no, I am in earnest. I am a \\[redacted\\] in \\[redacted\\] like you ." "No you aren\'t." "Yes I am and my name is Ann Mary Daniel. \'Ow can I \'elp you" "Okay \'Ann Mary\', I\'m getting a 505 error message when I try to access-" "Okay, \'old on, I put you tru to Tech Support."  As I mentioned in a letter to one of your countrymen, immigrants come in spuriously claiming that they want jobs, education, as refugees from conflicts etc., which may be tolerated. However the line is crossed when they desire white women, which is their ultimate and hidden aim. Indians should stick to their own tawny pagan P\\*ki women who are, as a rule, short and ugly. I would like to know your thoughts on this. You may reply to me at your leisure.  Yours truly,  Felix C. Crane  Post Scriptum- I have some Indian relatives so I know what I am talking about. Moreover, my real name is not "Felix Crane" and my profile picture is a computer-generated portrait.  “Two, four, six, eight, we don\'t want to integrate.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m actually crying right now.

      <li>Title::: 'Single dimension affirmative action ends up being useless 99% of the times'<br />Body: 'So on this other Indian sub which shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, some guy in Sweden made a long post on how "reservations" helped him. \n\nI just thought of making a broader post on how not just reservations but pretty much all forms of single dimension affirmative actions are actually quite useless in the broader world.\n\nFirstly, I strongly believe that the root cause of any oppression cannot be pinned down to a single dimension such as caste or gender. Most of the times, the truly oppressed have a plethora of factors working against them. To give you an example of someone who\'s truly oppressed, lets assume a woman who\'s a dalit and lives in a village working at the crematorium. Now this is someone who truly needs help, but will this woman ever get any help? I don\'t think so.\n\nExhibit 1 -\n\nThere are reservations in a nearby government college. Who do you think is more likely to benefit from such a reservation? Lets assume we have our truly oppressed dalit woman and we also have the son of a reserved category RBI employee who lives with his family in some lush green RBI quarters where his dad comfortably made more than minimum wage all his life and has sent his son to a nearby Kendriya Vidyalaya. I am pretty sure that the son of the the RBI employee is gonna be the one to get the seat in the government college. Also, are we really supposed to believe that looking at son of the RBI employee, the woman will somehow believe that she could also do this at some point? I mean, except for being born in the same caste, this woman and that RBI son\'s guy are literally world\'s apart and would have nothing in common whatsoever. \n\nExhibit 2 -\n\nA prominent MNC wants to correct the gender imbalance in its rank and file. They decide to hire more women. Now our dalit woman from the village who barely cleared 5th standard is nowhere in the picture. On the other hand is some upper caste woman who was born into an affluent upper middle class family that sponsored her entire education including her degree in XYZ gender studies from TISS. This woman applies for an HR position and voila, she gets accepted on the spot ! Now are you gonna tell me that looking at this woman working as a HR, our dalit woman from the village will in any way feel "empowered". Are you really asking me to believe that she would feel she has a real shot at this? If that\'s the way it worked then all our women would be into politics after looking at Indira Gandhi.\n\nI truly think any particular dimension such as caste or gender is a very massive spectrum. Affirmative action along just one dimension is not gonna resolve anything. The upper end of the spectrum will always be the sole benefactors of affirmative action for that particular dimension. This creamy upper end of any dimension, be it caste or gender, except for being part of the dimension have nothing else in common. For example, except for being born in a reserved category family, our RBI guy\'s son is in no way what your average oppressed guy looks like. Similarly except for being born as a female, your average upper middle class and upper caste woman is nothing what an actually oppressed person looks like.\n\nIf these guys want affirmative action to actually help someone, they need to make it multi-dimensional or as they put it "intersectional" . Maybe apart from being born in a reserved family, you also need to be a female? Maybe apart from being born as a female, you also need to be from a family that earns less than XYZ per annum?\n\nI am not saying that these multi dimensional affirmative actions will completely eliminate the possibility of undue benefactors benefiting, but they will significantly increase the probability of the truly needy benefiting.\n\nAlas, such a multi dimensional affirmative action would also reduce the potential votes our politicians could court or the potential candidates most MNCs can hire. Why would any politician narrow down their voter base from Dalits to Dalit+woman when they can get all the dalits? and why would any company go through the hassle of actually skilling and educating a 5th fail woman when they could get a woman who had all the skills of an equally privileged man? So they would rather just "pretend" to help the needy while actually achieving nothing solid.'<br />Author: 'lic_n_reg_pls'  id: 'rn4ich'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rn4ich/single_dimension_affirmative_action_ends_up_being/</li>

This is the reason it sounds less like a vedic lore and more like a hollywood script that has the right setting and characters but they are so far removed from original spirit and story so as to be irrecogniable. The characters has no voice. Its so boring. None of them. Just sentences that can fit anywhere. The timeline is all jumbled up and then its marketed in the name of vedic lore and still manage to be a bestseller.

      <li>Title::: 'The need for broad scale pedestrianisation of Indian Cities!'<br />Body: "So I'm going to argue for why we need to restrict cars and other personal vehicles in our cities, please tell in the comments if you agree or have some counter arguments.\n\n\n1. Our cities are not designed for cars : Almost all of our cities are centuries if not millennia old. The lanes are narrow and there aren't any places for parking either. Using vehicles in these areas cause unnecessary congestion. Unnecessary because in all of the cities daily needs shops are always available at a walking distance (&lt;1km). Completely pedestrainising and beautifying old and market areas will ease congestion and cause less accidents and deaths.\n\n\n2. It will be a boost to economy : Now you might think that restricting the automobile market will have a negative impact on the economy, but that's not true. For a city to restrict automobile, it has to invest in public transport and all of the companies that makes cars, sells busses too. Also pedestrainising market areas gives a boost ro them as people stop by and buy more things instead of just driving past them. This was seen in [Barcelona, Spain](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/17/superblocks-rescue-barcelona-spain-plan-give-streets-back-residents). Investing in public transport will also give temporary rise in construction jobs and permanently to those who will be driving these vehicles.\n\n\n3. Will tackle pollution : This is a no brainer. Vehicular emissions are about 1/5th of a cities overall air pollution. They also cause a lot of noise pollution too.\n\n\n4. Will free up public space for people : We have sacrifices so much of our public space to cars. It is even more of a problem in India because most roads do not even have footpaths. We also have to spend money on massive parking complexes. A car usually spends mored than half pf it's life parked. Restricting cars will free up som much space for people! People flock on to pedestrian areas, India has some example too. MG marg in Gangtok sees a heavy foot traffic. It's has an overall positive impact on the mental and physical health of people, because pedestrian streets are beautiful and much less polluting.\n\n\n[This post was inspired by this video.](https://youtu.be/rSSNlM3Au1A)"<br />Author: 'devansh_-_'  id: 'rmpkxk'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rmpkxk/the_need_for_broad_scale_pedestrianisation_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: "India has world's top 3 reserves of thorium on eastern coast beaches-linked with illegal sand mining .Over 60 lakh cr worth thorium disappeared in UPA reign.Our work to develop thorium reactors stalled during UPA post US nuclear deal where we chose to depend on imported uranium &amp; agreed on test ban."<br />Body: 'TLDR:\n\n1. India has one of the world\'s largest reserves of Thorium along the sand beaches of east coast &amp; minimal reserves of uranium. \n2. Therefore, India has been attempting to build Thorium fuelled reactors\n3. While Nehru had banned export of the mineral rich sands because of presence of rare earths, the bans were subsequently lifted in 2006, making it easier for sand mining companies to export the rare earths from sand except Thorium. Ban was lifted to coincide with Indo-US nuclear deal\n4. While technically there is ban on Thorium export by private companies, there is no accountability and as per Lok Sabha records between 2002 &amp; 2012, 60 lakh crores worth Thorium has disappeared from the beaches.\n5. Indo-US nuclear deal meanwhile made us dependent  on imported uranium to benefit US nuclear based corporates, while throttling Thorium fuelled development and at the same time, effectively bound us to non-proliferation treaty with the agreement that if we test any more nuclear weapons, we will lose all access to uranium. This at a time we are increasingly moving towards replacing coal based power with imported uranium based power.\n6. China built its first Thorium fuelled reactor in Sep 21.\n\nA look into US universities focusing on India\'s vast resources of Thorium &amp; attempt to use it for nuclear reactors &amp; not depend on uranium:\n\n&gt;*Thorium does have several advantages over Uranium as a nuclear power source. Thorium is three times more abundant in the Earth\'s crust than Uranium, and many Thorium deposits contain other mineral resources of value (rare earths elements in particular). Significant Thorium deposits exist in the United States, Brazil, India, and Australia; these countries all have estimates of Thorium resources of greater than 600 kt. \\[1\\] Additionally, all the Thorium that is mined can be used in a reactor, in comparison to less than 1% of natural Uranium that may be used. \\[2\\] Finally, Th-232 possesses a 14 billion year half-life, rendering it safer than Uranium and Plutonium. \\[2\\]*\n\n[http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2018/ph241/wolak1/](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2018/ph241/wolak1/)\n\n&gt;The tropical beaches of India probably bring to mind sun-dappled palms, fiery fish curries and dreadlocked backpackers, but they also hold a surprising secret. Their sands are rich in thorium – often hailed as a cleaner, safer alternative to conventional nuclear fuels.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**India has the world’s largest reserves of Thorium Ore, or 60% of the world’s Thorium deposits\u200a—\u200atwice that of the US, Brazil and Australia put together**. **While these deposits in India are easily accessible in the form of sands (monazite) in our sea beaches, in most other countries, Thorium reserves are embedded in rocks which require elaborate processing to extract\u200a—\u200aboth tedious and costly.** 100 Tonnes of mineral rock yields just one kilogram of Thorium. A small place in Tamil Nadu (Manavalakurichi) supposedly has 12 % of World’s Thorium, although some reports suggest it could have as much as 30%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Thorium Ore can be found all along our sea beaches from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh all the way up to Tamil Nadu and Kerala**, easily accessible in the form of mineral sands. After extraction from ore, Thorium does not require energy-intensive enrichment as is the case with Uranium.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From Mineral rich sands (Monazite), it is possible to extract Thorium, Cerium, Cesium, Platinum and Lanthanum, and these minerals are referred as RARE EARTHS and are extremely expensive in global markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thorium in its liquid form burns more efficiently than solid Uranium; liquid thorium reactors do not operate at dangerous high pressures. A Thorium-powered Nuclear Reactor is inherently safe. It doesn’t run the risk of “meltdown” or explosion nor can even a dirty bomb be created. Its nuclear reaction simply stops when its neutron exciter is turned off.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The country has long been eager to exploit its estimated 300,000 to 850,000 tonnes of thorium – quite probably the world’s largest reserves – but progress has been slow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;India’s strategy was governed by different calculus. **The country’s meagre uranium deposits convinced the founding father of its nuclear programme, Homi Bhabha, that any long-term strategy must exploit thorium, its most abundant fuel**, which inspired a three-stage programme that is still the central plank of India’s nuclear energy policy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/](https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181016-why-india-wants-to-turn-its-beaches-into-nuclear-fuel](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181016-why-india-wants-to-turn-its-beaches-into-nuclear-fuel)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**As India’s** [**Department of Atomic Energy**](http://www.dae.nic.in/?q=node/118)\xa0**clearly recognizes, “We have rather meager reserves of uranium…We, however, have nearly a third of the entire world’s thorium…Our strategies for large scale deployment of nuclear energy must be, and are therefore, focused towards utilisation of thorium.”**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;"In 2002, construction on a prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam\xa0was approved by the regulatory authority, and this reactor is expected to progress to the second stage of the program by late 2014.\xa0Six additional fast reactors are slated for construction, with four of them planned for 2020.\n\n[https://k1project.columbia.edu/news/thorium-dream](https://k1project.columbia.edu/news/thorium-dream)\n\n[https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/](https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/)\n\n**Most of us have been led to believe that the biggest scams of the UPA-era were the CWG scam, the 2G spectrum scam, the National Herald newspaper scam and the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam. This is far from the truth.**\n\n**The Thorium scam, the Bank NPAs, and the gold / gems import scams were much bigger. Let us look at the ₹60,00,000 crores Thorium Scam.**\n\nA look into Jagran 2012 report on this:\n\n&gt;**"The Great Thorium Robbery: Mother Of All Scams…!!"**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Thorium is believed as a key factor to India’s nuclear programme being freed from the dependence on uranium imports to power our nuclear plants and allowing us to develop limitless amounts of fuel since it could be extracted from sand on beaches.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***But according to recent published report in ‘The Statesman’, the government has failed to control the export of monazite, the raw material from which thorium can be extracted, and has allowed extraction of2.1 million tonnes of monazite.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The report estimates that if the thorium extracted from the monazite is estimated at $5,000 per tonne (Ref :*** [***thorium.tv***](http://www.thorium.tv/en/thorium_costs/thorium_costs.php)***), then the loss to the exchequer is approximately Rs 48 lakh crore, in addition to the incalculable loss to the nuclear fuel programme.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Thorium Disappearing: UPA’s new Coalgate?*** *The report comments on UPA’s policy on natural resources. It says,* ***“Since the UPA government assumed office in 2004 with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, 2.1 million tones of monazite, equivalent to 195,300 tonnes of thorium at 9.3 per cent recovery, has disappeared from the shores of India.”***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*‘Thorium disappearing’ should be considered more serious as it is related with India’s Nuclear programme. Thorium is a clean nuclear fuel of strategic importance for both nuclear energy generation and nuclear-tipped missiles. The beaches of Orissa Sand Complex, Manavalakurichi in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu and the Aluva-Chavara belt on the Kerala coast have been identified under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, as the main monazite bearing areas in the country.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Developed Nations encouraging thorium-based reactors*** *: The US and Japan are actively looking to increase their production of thorium and thorium-based reactors says report. That why, India needs to safeguard its mineral resources by banning the export of minerals from which thorium can be extracted, in order to safeguard its nuclear fuel programme for the future.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Thorium is crucial*** *: On 2-December, 2009, Prithviraj Chouhan, then Minister for Science &amp; Technology and Earth Science has stated in parliament, “Complete replacement of uranium by thorium in existing Indian Reactors is not feasible without a major change in design. However, thorium has been used in a few bundles of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors earlier. Large scale use of thorium is planned in the 3rd stage of the Indian Nuclear Power Programme.”*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Similarly, In July 2012, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman R K Sinha has stated that, the only problem with Thoriun\xa0 is that it can\'t be used directly as a fuel and it has got its own limitations too. This is the reason why the AEC is working hard to develop the next generation reactors that can use thorium as a fuel. This explains that Thorium is crucial for the Indian nuclear power programme and Indian government needs to guard its exports more carefully.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Destroying Ramsetu: Easy approach to Thorium rich beaches?*** *It is considered that a large chunk of Thorium would be washed away if Ram Sethu is blasted. And almost all of it would be lost if another tsunami strikes the region. The Sethusamudram Canal, if built destroying RamSethu, will be beneficial to\xa0 private parties for easy snatching of beach sand for Thorium available on beaches of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The social organisations which protested against Sethusamudram Project said that since India had rich thorium resources and the technology to use it, the US was pressuring the Centre to speedily implement the Sethusamudram project (through India-US Nuclear Deal).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.jagran.com/blogs/rakeshmishra/the-great-thorium-robbery-mother-of-all-scams/](https://www.jagran.com/blogs/rakeshmishra/the-great-thorium-robbery-mother-of-all-scams/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://ibtl.in/news/national/2015/thorium-disappearing-upas-new-coalgate](https://ibtl.in/news/national/2015/thorium-disappearing-upas-new-coalgate)\n\n**Jaideep Prabhu wrote for DNA in April 2014:**\n\n&gt;\\*\\*“\\*\\****A few years ago, a story appeared in the\xa0Indian press\xa0that a massive\xa0scam involving the illegal mining and covert export of thorium\xa0was taking place in Tamil Nadu. Then, two things happened: one, the story died out quickly without anyone investigating it further...***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The beach sands of Tamil Nadu and Kerala are rich in several heavy minerals such as ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, garnet, sillimanite, zircon and monazite. These minerals are used in several industries from steel and electronics to jewellery and ceramics. Monazite, however, contains thorium, a nuclear fuel of much interest.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***The export of Monazite, used to procure nuclear cooperation from foreign states, was also banned by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. It was illegal to mine these rare earth heavy minerals until recently; the only entity allowed to do so was government-owned Indian Rare Earths Limited (“IRE”). In\xa0October 1998, government of India opened sand mining to private companies, on the basis of two licenses, one to mine the sand and another to handle nuclear materials. A further change in the law in January 2006\xa0removed\xa0several of the minerals in the beach sands from the prescribed list and thus reduced the paperwork required to just one license to handle nuclear materials; private companies were now allowed to mine the sands for export of any mineral except monazite.*** *The law retained thorium as a prescribed substance under the Atomic Energy Act and as a result, monazite remained off-limits to private entities.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*However, the law also\xa0recognised\xa0that these minerals were mixed in the sand and therefore stipulated that companies handling the beach sand have to get a licence under the Atomic Energy (Radiation Protection) Rules from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The company would have to either dispose of the monazite or store it on its premises as per regulations. Indian government denied private companies permission to process the monazite for thorium or to export the mineral: only IREL would be allowed to do that.* ***The thorium scam allegations make four claims:\xa01) A\xa0private company\xa0is exporting thorium-rich sand illegally, 2) Between 2002 and 2012, some 2.1 million tonnes of monazite have gone missing, which amounts to approximately 235,000 tonnes of Thorium,\xa03) The Monazite has not been returned by the private company to the DAE after mining for other minerals, 4) Only a gentleman’s agreement requires the private company to inform the government about how much Monazite that they possess.***\xa0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The second accusation springs from a discrepancy between two reports by the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (“AMDER”) of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).* ***In a report read to the Lok Sabha in 2012, the AMDER stated that there were 10.7 tonnes of Monazite on India’s beaches; in a similar report prepared in 2002, AMDER had claimed 12.8 tonnes of the mineral to be present. This would indicate that 2.1 tonnes of Monazite, or approximately 235,000 tonnes of Thorium, had gone missing in the intervening period.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-what-happened-to-the-rs-60-lakh-crore-thorium-scam-1982959](https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-what-happened-to-the-rs-60-lakh-crore-thorium-scam-1982959)\n\nRest of the post iss reproduced from this blog:\n\n[https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/](https://bagariaamit.com/2018/06/07/%e2%82%b9600000000000000/)\n\n**THORIUM &amp; ILLEGAL MINING ON TAMIL NADU BEACHES**\n\n&gt;In August 2005, at an international conference on emerging nuclear energy systems in Brussels, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre scientists Usha Pal and V Jagannathan stated that BARC had designed the “World’s Safest Thorium based Nuclear Reactor,” after some seven years of effort.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thorium is the preferred future fuel because of low radio-toxicity waste. It is rated as a clean fuel and is only slightly radioactive; it is clean with no burden of nuclear waste disposal. In one year, a 1GW Thorium Reactor produces less than 1% of hazardous waste.It is also potentially usable to breed reactor fuel and can theoretically generate 40 times more energy per unit compared to Uranium. Thorium based Fast Breeder Reactors (“FBR”) can breed more fuel than they consume.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A single Thorium FBR can produce all the Uranium fuel needed for all our 17 nuclear reactors. Usage of Thorium FBR’s would have freed India from importing expensive Uranium fuel from abroad.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;India’s post-Pokharan isolation led scientists at BARC to develop a FBR using Thorium\u200a—\u200athe Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam\u200a—\u200awhich has been running for 27 years. India has indigenously built a 500 MW thorium fuelled FBR.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Late President APJ Abdul Kalam had told said that India must develop Thorium based nuclear reactors. Thorium contains 150 times more energy than Uranium and is the most efficient combustible.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Plutonium, which is bred in FBRs and Thorium reactors, could be used for defence purposes which has the ability to bestow India with strategic advantage over the comity of nations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**India was the leading creator of Thorium-based FBR nuclear technology\u200ain the world, until Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and then Defence Minister A.K Antony mothballed it for 10 years.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Once the Sonia Gandhi led UPA came to power, Dr. Manmohan Singh followed a policy of severely downsizing indigenous Thorium-based technology programme, thereby making India dependent on foreign countries for advanced nuclear technology.** Indian nuclear scientists at Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) claim that by 2013, India would have mastered the technology to build Thorium based 1GW nuclear reactors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**A cartel headed by a Tirunelveli-based businessman, S.Vaikundarajan, main promoter of VV Minerals headquartered in Thisaiyanvilai, Tirunelveli, is\xa0depriving India of its precious mineral wealth.**\xa0As I said earlier, Manavalakurichi in the Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu has the world’s largest deposit of monazite, ilmenite, garnet, zircon and rutile, all strategically and economically important minerals and metals. ***VV Minerals owns 96 out of the 111 garnet mining licences issued by the Indian Bureau of Mines*****.** The Government of India has issued 44 licences for mining Ilmenite and they own all the licences.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The value the Thorium reserves at Manavalakurichi is 720 times more than the 2G spectrum scam, according to leading geologists.** VV Minerals, which has monopolised sand mining along the seashore on the basis of its ability to bend and break laws of the land, is exporting the thorium-rich sand. Containers filled with sand from Manavalakurichi are exported through the Tuticorin Port. Instances of boats ferrying sand laden bags to ships anchored off the Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari coasts are regular sights, as per the locals in that area.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mining baron Vaikundarajan has allegedly made lakhs of crores by exporting ilmenite, rutile, garnet and zircon**.** Though the Department of Atomic Energy (“DAE”) controls the sand along\xa0the coastline, because of the presence of elements like zircon, thorium and ilmenite, officials look the other way, when sand rich in thorium\xa0is exported from the region.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Officials of DAE have ignored the wanton looting taking place right in front of their eyes, as they are perhaps on the take. There are allegations that engineers in Indian Rare Earths Limited and DAE were helping Vaikundarajan export Monazite to other countries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Dr. CSP Iyer, former director, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, narrates an interesting incident when the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research wanted to find out the impact of mining along South India’s coastline and asked him to prepare a status report. “I was not allowed anywhere near the areas being mined by these private companies. They have something to hide,” he said.***\n\n**THORIUM &amp; INDO-US NUCLEAR DEAL**\n\n&gt;**Immediately before the signing of the Indo-US civil nuclear deal in 2007, Government of India amended the Mines &amp; Minerals Act by a Government order, probably under pressure\xa0from USA, to facilitate the export of the mineral-rich sand. Until then, private companies were not allowed mining of Monazite because of the presence of Thorium.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The illegal export of Thorium was first noted by scientists of DAE. Since their hands were tied because of bureaucratic procedures, they alerted concerned citizens in Chennai like former secretary to Tamil Nadu Government, V Sundaram and former executive at Asian Development Bank, S Kalyanaraman. Sundaram, an IAS officer belonging to the old school had been Tirunelveli District Collector and\xa0knew the district like the back of his hand. **“What I found was flabbergasting. I hope Chief Minister Jayalalithaa would bring the culprits to book and save the south Indian coastline from further looting,” he said.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the 30th of November 2011, V. Narayanasamy (then the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office), told the Lok Sabha “*However, under the guidelines framed by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (“AERB”), individual processors of beach sand have to separate and safely keep the Monazite content of such sand. No individual or entity is permitted to process Monazite in any manner without a licence from DAE. Further, no licences have been given to any private party to process Monazite and separate Thorium*,” said the Minister.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**However, Narayanaswamy did not say whether companies keep the sand containing Monazite with them after they have processed and extracted other minerals from the sand. Scientists and engineers said they were in the dark about the quantity of Monazite extracted by private companies and whether it has been exported or not.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Several scientists disagreed with Narayanaswamy. “*****Heavy mineral deposits often contain relatively high levels of radioactive elements (Thorium &amp; Uranium). It is difficult to obtain clean separation of Ilmenite and Monazite and physical intergrowths of the two minerals are not uncommon. As a result, Ilmenite concentrates obtained from such deposits often contain high levels of Thorium and Uranium*****,” wrote J Nell, a noted mineral scientist, in a research paper.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research of the DAE, claims India’s coastline has a deposit of 10.7 million tonnes of Monazite from which it is possible to extract 8,46,477 tonnes of Thorium metal.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was also announced by Narayanasamy in the Lok Sabha on the 14th of March, 2012. He said the Monazite is spread across States like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Orissa, West Bengal and Bihar. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh account for 2.16 million tonnes and 3.74 million tonnes Monazite, respectively.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**At about ₹32.5 crores per tonne, the value of 8.46 Lakh tonnes of Thorium is approximately ₹275 Lakh Crores, or $4.25 Trillion. India’s GDP in the current fiscal is expected to be about $2.6 Trillion, so, if these estimates are to be believed, our Thorium reserves are worth 1.63 times the country’s annual GDP.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**VV Mineral supposedly exported 15,87,806 tonnes of minerals during from 1999 to 2009 through just the Tuticorin Port. The company website itself claims that their annual export is 3,92,000 tonnes of mineral.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**IRE officials are silent about the Monazite which the private enterprises were supposed to return to the Government. “It is a gentleman’s agreement and we have to believe what they tell us,” said Dr, CSP Iyer, former director, BARC. It is an open secret that some of the senior engineers of IRE and DAE work as consultants to private mining companies at exorbitant fees, which is 10 times more than what they get as monthly remuneration from the government.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How private companies flourished at the expense of India’s public sector undertakings is best described by the profit they generate by exporting precious minerals and other materials. **IRE, with 2700 hectares of mineable land under its control, exported minerals worth ₹97.7 crore during from 2007 to 2010. But VV Minerals and its associates, which own just 187 hectares, earned ₹408 Crores (declared income) during the same period.**\n\n**US NUCLEAR DEAL SUMMARY: MAKING INDIA ENERGY DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED URANIUM WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY EFFECTIVELY MAKING INDIA SIGNATORY TO CBDT BY MAKING IT AGREE THAT ON ANY FURTHER THERMO-NUCLEAR TESTS, INDIA WILL LOOSE ALL ACCESS TO URANIUM**\n\n&gt;Indian media had numerous articles\xa0on how Dr. Manmohan Singh led UPA government was securing India’s future energy security by signing the Indo-US nuclear deal (the “123 Agreement”).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;***In this context, it is worth remembering the tragic accidental deaths of Homi Bhabha &amp; Vikram Sarabhai, both involved in nuclear research. Two of our nuclear submarine scientists, Josh and Shivam, were found dead on railway tracks.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Mainstream media told us how this deal was going to push India into the big league of countries, by putting us on course to being the next super power.** This hype was deliberately manufactured by Sonia Gandhi and her coterie.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The reasons why USA desperately wanted the nuclear deal were clear from the start. It wanted American companies like GE and Westinghouse to pursue nuclear trade with India worth billions of dollars and prevent India’s emergence as a real nuclear military power.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The nuclear deal, called the 123 Agreement, was subject to US laws such as the Hyde Act, and clearly stated that, if India tests a nuclear device, all further nuclear trade will end and nuclear material already sold to India should be returned. With no commitment to supply nuclear fuel, USA put a cap on India’s strategic programme, subjected us to the Non-Proliferation Treaty against our stated policy, and inspection of our nuclear installations through the International Atomic Energy Agency.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**India’s indigenous nuclear programme, which was progressing quite well at that time, especially after encouragement during the 6-years of Vajpayee as Prime Minister, were put on the backburner.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**As per the 123 deal, India agreed to separate our civilian and military nuclear activity and open up the civilian part to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In return, the US offered to resume full nuclear trade with India, ending our nuclear expulsion. We carved out two large chunks of real estate in Mithi Virdi (Gujarat) and Kovvada (Andhra Pradesh), and offered them to two multinationals to set up nuclear power plants.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While Toshiba-Westinghouse was given the Gujarat site for building six AP1000 reactors of 1100 MW each (total 6600 MW), and GE-Hitachi was to be given the Kovvada site to set up six units of 1594 MW each (total 9564 MW). Both projects involved untested technologies at that time. In both instances, public sector Nuclear Power Corporation of India was to be the operator.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The aim of the much hyped “Indo-US Nuclear Deal” was perhaps to make India one of the top three markets for American &amp; European companies, rather than a competitor, in the $100 Billion nuclear power technology market. The deal would create a huge market for the Big3 conventional nuclear reactor manufacturers\u200a—\u200aWestinghouse, Areva and GE.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**According to nuclear scientists at DAE, the attention given to the FBR and Thorium program were reduced still further by 2008, when discussions began with international companies about supply of conventional Uranium based nuclear reactors to India.** **If this had not been done, scientists say that by 2013 at the latest, India may have been able to develop the technology for 1GW reactors, thereby creating an export market with a potential for sales of $4 billion per year, initially. This advantage was handed over to China” Incidentally, China is now on the cusp of mastering the technology of 2GW reactors, while India was being forced in the UPA-era to rely on overseas suppliers for 1GW nuclear power plants.**\n\n# Meanwhile this September, China successfully built thorium fuelled nuclear reactor:\n\n&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02459-w](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02459-w)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.livescience.com/china-creates-new-thorium-reactor.html](https://www.livescience.com/china-creates-new-thorium-reactor.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2016, Russian nuclear agency Rosatom commercially commissioned its BN800 FBR, which produces about 800 MW of electricity and supplies it to the Ural region including the city of Yekateringburg.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*After coming to power in 2014, Narendra Modi has empowered Indian scientists and agencies to develop Thorium-based FBRs. The indigenously designed and locally constructed Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (“PFBR”), an important link in India’s quest to gain complete control of the fuel cycle, is nearing completion. Once completed, it would allow the capability to grow “geometrically” and would make India the second country, after Russia, in the world to operate a FBR.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Six FBR units are planned to be set up, of which the first two will come up at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu. All six units are expected to become operational latest by 2039, though PM Modi is personally pushing for them to start much earlier. Construction of the two units at Kalpakkam is planned to start by 2021 and expected to begin commercial operations by 2029.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*India has been following a closed fuel cycle and FBR is a critical link to it. The PFBR was scheduled to go critical in 2010 but it has missed several deadlines since then. It is an example of public-private partnership and many private industrial players like L&amp;T and Walchandnagar Industries have contributed to the project. The public sector firm Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited is a major contributor in the project.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Founders of India’s nuclear energy programme harped on a closed fuel cycle, which means that India is reprocessing and remaking spent fuel from our nuclear power reactors. We have been following a three-stage nuclear electricity program: (1) pressurised heavy-water reactors (PHWRs) using natural uranium as fuel; (2) FBRs using plutonium and depleted uranium from the PHWRs; and (3) FBRs using abundant Thorium found in India.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Mainstreaming FBR technology and usage is the key to make nuclear energy sustainable in India. FBRs generate more fuel than they consume and are hence termed as breeders. Countries such as the US and France have also experimented with FBR technology programmes.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*India’s installed nuclear power capacity is currently 6780 MW from our 22 operational plants, with another 6700 MW expected to be added by the year 2021. The Narendra Modi Government has set a target of achieving nuclear power capacity of 14000 MW by 2024.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*PM Modi wants 25% of our electricity needs to be met by nuclear reactors by 2050. USA currently gets 20% of its power from nuclear energy, but this could fall to less than 10% by 2050, due to exceptionally slow construction rates, as getting regulatory approvals from the federal U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a conventional reactor\xa0can take up to 25 years, while building a new plant by takes about 10 years.*'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'rm2tp6'<br />Score:238<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rm2tp6/india_has_worlds_top_3_reserves_of_thorium_on/</li>

See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/15/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**—CHAPTER 2: MATHURA KANDA ("The Mathura Chapter")—**\n\n**—2.1. Motivated questionnaire—**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n*In the 158th year of Magadha hegemony*\n\n*(334 BC)*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nPabbata studied his opponent’s stance carefully, his eyes narrowed and his body ready to spring into action at the slightest provocation. \n\nChanakya hardly held any interest in teaching duelling for its own sake, of course – duelling was for the weak and the foolish, he’d say, for a king possessed of intelligence and strength would employ strategy rather than leave his victory up to a game of chance. Rather, Chanakya’s intention was to use these matches as an analogy for real battles: each player had a fortress to defend, represented by a stick in the ground, and was equipped with swords that represented each side’s army, and victory was achieved by either grabbing the opponent’s stick (capturing the enemy fortress) or by laying a single touch on the opponent’s body with one’s sword (destroying the enemy army). \n\nA conqueror who simply sprinted to capture the enemy fortress would immediately be cut down by the enemy with his army, as most army formations were easier to attack from the back and the sides than from the front (except the *Chakravyuha*, which could not be maintained in a mobile state); a force that fled the battlefield would see its fortress be captured by the enemy army.\n\nPabbata dashed forward, sword blazing, determined to pass through Chanakya’s defenses and cut him down—Chanakya blocked, using the point of impact as a pivot to reposition himself to Pabbata’s side—his signature move, that Pabbata had been expecting, and he spun on his heel to face Chanakya again—Chanakya tried the same move again, and they circled each other. \n\nApparently surprised by the failure of his manoeuvre, Chanakya stumbled – yes, this would be Pabbata’s first victory against his Chanakya, the student would surpass the Professor – he took advantage of the confusion, and with the intention of attacking too quickly for Chanakya to react, swooped in for the kill. Chanakya quickly took a defensive stance, blocking Pabbata’s blows, allowing Pabbata to push the line of control with his sheer strength—\n\nAnd when he realized it, it was too late; Chanakya had seized his fortress and taken it in his hands, holding it high and showing it off like a spoil of war. For in his mad passions and in the spirit of securing a victory against Chanakya for the first time, Pabbata had neglected the entire purpose of an army in a battle: to block the enemy’s movement into his own territory, and he had failed to recognize that he had been pushing the line of control into his *own* territory. \n\nHumbled and embarrassed, Pabbata conceded. \n\nChanakya’s prideful smirk was barely noticeable; he did not take a sarcastic parting shot or make a heroic gesture as he often did after his victories in debate. \n\n“That manoeuvre is possible in real battle,” he taught, “Only if the size of your cavalry and chariotry is much larger than your enemy’s, if the article you wish to lay siege to is sufficiently distant in its location from the site of the battlefield, and if it is poorly defended.”\n\n“Or if you employ tactics of deception to compel the enemy fortress to surrender to you quickly, or to trap or harass the enemy’s pursuing army in its own country,” Chandragupta said, considering.\n\nIt was an intelligent idea, Pabbata thought, but Chanakya’s expression was unrewarding as ever, and he only expressed his approval verbally.\n\n(The disappeared Greek girl Thera had once asked Chanakya why he was so inexpressive in his manner, to which he had replied that there was a beautiful technology created by Purusha\\[1\\] eons ago for expression, and it was known as *language*. To obsess over the interpretation of inferior modes of communication, to promote art as a means of expression while language still lived, was a betrayal of the very spirit of man, and was analogous to having intercourse with a cheap prostitute when one’s righteously-wedded wife still lived.)\n\n“That concludes the lesson for today,” Chanakya said. “But Pabbata, there is a matter of crucial importance that we must discuss.”\n\nMy teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country, a sportive country is always ruinous to the results of work, whereas a sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians, buffoons and traders. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*No, says Kautilya, a sportive country, taking to sports for relaxation from labour, causes only a trifling loss; and after enjoyment, it resumes work, whereas a sportive king causes oppression by showing indulgence to his courtiers, by seizing and begging, and by obstructing work in the manufactories.* \n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 8.4:21-23\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and fifty-eight years ago.* \n\n*“ … the next suitor for the hand in marriage of the unblemished princess Vapushmati, whose radiant beauty knows no equal in history or in fiction, who was seized from the city of Champa upon the vanquishment of its rulers by the Great King Bimbisara, the mightiest of the Magadhas, and indeed of all Kshatriyas – is the fourth prince of Great King Bimbisara, born of his queen Vaishali-Devi Chellana: Prince Ajatashatru!”*\n\n*Light ceremonial applause filled the arena, sounds of some vague positive chants – and Ajatashatru strode in followed by what looked like a wheeled palanquin, pulled by two muscled attendants, and a cart containing several large rocks, pulled by four more attendants.*\n\n*“I object to your faint appraisal of me,” said the prince, his eyes most serious and considering, “But it is no matter of importance. You have viewed some impressive feats of strength from my brothers and cousins – Kshatravriddha, who sliced through a Fir trunk in one blow as if its wood were softer than butter. Remarkable!”* \n\n*He sent a flying kiss in the direction of his eldest brother, as if to clarify that all his words of praise were ironic. “But I will show you something of far greater splendor than any of the feats demonstrated by my brothers.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru’s attendant unveiled the most unusual device, that to the inquisitive faces in the audience appeared to be nothing more than a large spoon attached to some odd box-shaped contraption.*\n\n*“Behold!” cried the prince, “The device of my own invention, the ejector of large stones, the Catapult!*\n\n*“Ksemavriddhi says he can shatter a large boulder into fragments with four swings of his mace. How impressive! My device can turn an entire city wall to flour in the matter of seconds – wood and stone alike are defenseless against the might of my mind that I have represented by this magnificent device.”* \n\n*As a demonstration, his attendants slowly turned the catapult to its side to face an empty segment of the otherwise packed arena (for grand presentations of might always seemed to receive a large attendance in Magadha), loaded a stone from the cart into its magazine – and very ceremoniously, Ajatashatru struck the device somewhere with a rod.* \n\n*The steps of the arena chipped, and large cracks formed at the site of impact, and the women in the audience instinctively pressed their hands to their ears at the horrid crash that echoed through the bounds of the arena – Ajatashatru fired again, and a large chunk chipped off – and again, before King Bimbisara finally beseeched him to end the demonstration, for the sake of the finances of rebuilding the arena if nothing else.* \n\n*Ajatashatru bowed to his father in thick irony. “I believe that should suffice as a demonstration of my might as well as of my many other qualities – that it should suffice to make your decision not only as to the groom for the maiden you would have taken for yourself if not for the jealousy of my mother and stepmothers—”*\n\n*The king was furious, as were his queens and other princes.* \n\n*“—but also as to your future heir, the future Lord of Magadha, who will bring this kingdom to heights not previously—”*\n\n*“That is sufficient, son,” King Bimbisara interrupted curtly. “This is a contest to find the man worthy of the war spoils that I have decided to donate out of the generosity of my heart, not of the throne of Magadha. But that is irrelevant: for you will be receiving neither.”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Strength is of three kinds: power of deliberation is intellectual strength; the possession of a prosperous treasury and a strong army is the strength of sovereignty; and martial power is physical strength.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 6.2:33\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“There is a task I require from you, Pabbata,” said Chanakya, straightening the green lining on his dhoti as they prepared for sleep. “It is no trivial task, and is one that may impose a significant cost to you. You may not ask me for my causes or motives for seeking this from you. Do you understand?”\n\nPabbata frowned. “What is the task?”\n\n“It is good to ask that question before agreeing to perform an unstated favour,” said Chanakya approvingly. “But you should understand the confidentiality of this entire endeavour, and you may not repeat my words to anybody even if you refuse to obey my command. To do so would be a great breach of our trust and would sabotage our friendship and all that you have to gain from it in future. The same applies to Chandragupta. Do I have your word?” \n\nPabbata nodded. Chandragupta followed him. \n\n“Listen to my words precisely as I speak them,” Chanakya commanded, and looked Pabbata dead in the eye. “And do not distort them in your mind, just as you would not distort a word of the triple Vedas.\n\n“You must convince your father to start preparations for a military expedition to Indraprastha.”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n*What.*\n\n*What, Chanakya?*\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“Nothing would please me more than an expansion of Magadha’s borders, Professor,” said Pabbata at last. “And neither do I doubt your capacity to ensure my success in the achievement of this objective, even though all my father’s previous efforts to this end have been fruitless. But I must still object to this goal in itself: surely, the Arjunayanas, who rule Indraprastha, might be precisely the sort of allies I will need in my war, depending on the method of war that you will decide will be most appropriate when that time arrives. Surely, they are not a power I would seek to alienate – or much less, destroy, resulting only in the addition of territory to a kingdom ruled by my brother!”\n\nPabbata felt his voice rising with each word he said, and by the end of his sentence, it had truly become his belief on the matter. \n\nChanakya shook his head firmly. “The art of winning a civil war – or indeed in acquiring the power created by a war – does not lie merely in supporting one faction over another. It lies in providing covert support to *both* factions, through different identities or middle-men, and then committing to a side once the outcome of the war becomes clear. For a war whose outcome is known to both sides in advance should never be fought, any civil war that poses a serious threat to the reigning power will necessarily be uncertain in its outcome, and thus as one must not bet all of one’s wealth on one outcome in an uncertain horse race, one must not bet one’s entire political career on one outcome in a civil war.”\n\n“I see … ” said Pabbata slowly. “So you wish to create dissension within Magadha by means of this war, so that I have *two* forces at my disposal, rather than one, and that I come out on top regardless of who wins.”\n\nPabbata had often assumed that Chanakya knew nothing about manipulating people, or about lying effectively – but it was frightening how close Chanakya’s plan for him was to his private plans with Chanakya, and he wondered if the whole character of a *naïve genius* was merely the image that Chanakya chose to present of himself. \n\nHe reminded himself to be a bit extra-wary of Chanakya when it came to his own plots. \n\n“But,” Chandragupta interrupted, his eyes narrowed. “You said we couldn’t ask you the cause for the favour, and yet you just explained it to us so thoroughly. Is your explanation a lie, then?”\n\nPabbata felt a pang of anger rise within him – if Chandragupta was right, and Chanakya was *lying* to him, then that would be a betrayal, and he would have his revenge, Brahmahatya or no—\n\nChanakya turned around sharply, and cast an indignant look towards Chandragupta. “Indeed. That is only a small part of the cause for this plot, and it is part of a much greater scheme of mine. I cannot reveal this scheme to you, and you will not be able to understand my motives on your own; all I can say is that it serves your interests, Pabbata, and you will have to place your complete trust in me if our friendship is to produce anything of value. All will become clear in time.”\n\nThey were quiet for a moment.\n\n“Very well,” said Pabbata. “But I must press: you said that I could play both sides in this war. How would I obtain the support of the Arjunayanas if I am actively supporting my father’s campaign against them? What identity could I assume, and how can I be present in both Pataliputra and Indraprastha simultaneously?” \n\n“You will be present there through *me*—”\n\n“No way,” Pabbata muttered. Chanakya ignored him and continued.\n\n“—the king of the Arjunayanas has attended many debates that I have participated in, where he was greatly impressed by my intellect; he is a close acquaintance of mine. I will advise the Arjunayanas of Indraprastha in their war, just as you command the Magadhan army. And thus, the two of us, you and I, Pabbata, shall write history in whatever manner we find fit, we shall—”\n\n“Unacceptable,” Pabbata repeated. He remembered his earlier oath to be wary of Chanakya’s plans, and shook his vehemently. This *reeked* of manipulation, and he certainly did not intend to be written into history as the idiot puppet of Chanakya the great visionary, a cautionary tale for young princes against naivety.\n\n“Forgive me, Professor, but while I honour you greatly and have nothing but respect for your intellect, I also fear it, and you *cannot* expect me to trust you so. You might simply install me as a pawn in Magadha to sabotage my army as per your bidding while you vanquish my people with the Arjunayana army.”\n\nChanakya was quiet for a while.\n\n“It pains me that you distrust me so, Pabbata,” he sighed. “Have I truly given you a cause to be so suspicious of me?”\n\n“No, but you also have not given me a cause to *not* be so suspicious of you. I am no fool, Professor – I know that you have an agenda of your own, goals of your own, and these may not be the same as mine in every manner. It is a great degree of trust you demand from me, and I cannot promise this to you yet.”\n\n“Victory depends on trust between entire armies, entire countries of people. To establish such trust is difficult, but we could achieve great things much more easily if you simply just trusted me without cause. You *must* find allies whom you can trust, if you wish to succeed in war.”\n\nThen Pabbata had an idea. He remembered the intelligence, the potential that Chandragupta had showed over these years that they had spent at Taxila; the loyalty he had demonstrated that very day in pointing out – out of concern for Pabbata’s interests – the contradiction in Chanakya’s narrative and said:\n\n“There *is* one other person, apart from myself, whom I trust, for he has been by my side since infancy, attending to every want of mine since the age that he became capable of doing so. *Him* I trust. If you are truly desirous of my interests, then you will allow Chandragupta to take your place as the advisor of the Arjunayanas.” \n\nChanakya and Pabbata had an unspoken stare-off.\n\n“And you believe,” Chanakya asked at last, “That I will not be able to turn Chandragupta, in your absence?”\n\n“Impossible,” said Pabbata, and Chandragupta smiled gratefully.\n\n“Very well, then,” said Chanakya. “Chandragupta shall be appointed as advisor to the Arjunayanas, on my recommendation. All my influence over the Arjunayanas will be through him, and he will covertly keep you updated of every detail of our conversation via the cipher that I have taught you. It need not be said that you will not share this cipher with anybody, and shall discard his messages as soon as you receive them in Pataliputra. \n\n“And,” he continued, turning to Chandragupta in a very Professorial gait, “I believe it may be beneficial for you to maintain some degree of opacity in your affairs at Indraprastha – but it will also not do to have the Arjunayanas believe that you have deceived them. Thus, you shall adopt an epithet synonymous with your true name: *Shashigupta* \\[2\\].”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*It is no crime for barbarians to sell or mortgage the life of their own offspring. But never shall an Arya \\[3\\] be subjected to slavery.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 3.13:3-4\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and fifty-eight years ago.* \n\n*“Kshatravriddha can slice a tree in one blow, how impressive!” Ajatashatru’s voice dripped with indignance. “Do you know what else can uproot a tree in one blow? An elephant! Do you know what an elephant cannot do? This!”* \n\n*He struck his contraption again, sending a rock hurling past the palatial walls and crashing somewhere out of vision with a noise that was still deafening.*\n\n*“Truly, I do not comprehend what you believe your great feat is, son,” said King Bimbisara. “You merely struck a latch. It is your assistants who are doing the heavy work.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru stumbled, astonished by his own father’s stupidity.*\n\n*“Does the strength of my intellect mean nothing to you, father?” he pleaded.* \n\n*It was Bimbisara’s most trusted advisor, an Ajivika monk by the name of Dirghalochana, that answered.*\n\n*“If it is your scholarship that you wish to be respected for, young prince,” he suggested, his voice soft, “Perhaps you ought to seek refuge in one of the Western realms, like Vaishali, Kashi, Ayodhya, Mathura, even Taxila—”*\n\n*“Ah yes!” cried Ajatashatru. “The Vedic lands! Where the Brahmins, who brag about their incredible scholarship, believe that archery is really about building bridges out of arrows, that the hallmark of a great archer is the ability to shoot an arrow at the sky and make it rain! Yes, perhaps THERE I will be respected for my strategic acumen and my ingenuity at creating military technologies.”*\n\n*“I studied at Taxila,” Dirghalochana tried to argue. “And even as I have many differences with the ways of the Brahmins, you are being unfair in your assessment of them, as you are in your critique of your own people.”*\n\n*“Or perhaps you are a clown who does not comprehend my genius,” Ajatashatru spat at the ground.* \n\n*“Perhaps,” Dirghalochana admitted. “Perhaps you are ahead of your time.”*\n\n*This seemed to invoke a new fervour in Ajatashatru, who threw the key of his catapult towards the ground and unsheathed his sword.*\n\n*“History is littered with the corpses of men who were ahead of their time,” he muttered, his face red.* \n\n*Ajatashatru then strode towards the pedestal upon which Princess Vapushmati was tied, slashed through her chains with his sword, and kissed her lips with cutting rage.* \n\n*The crowd gasped; the king, the queens and princes, the army and all were completely thrown off, if they hadn’t been already, finding themselves in a rather unusual situation and not having a faintest instinct for how to react; the other princes unsheathed their swords, and Vapushmati was shaking, terrified, by the civil war that was unfurling around her between the Magadhan princes.*\n\n*Ajatashatru spoke loud and clear: “Allow me to defile the sanctity of this entire ceremony by saying the following words: the woman you believe is now your wife, my dear brother, has already been enjoyed by me! Not only this, Kshatravriddha: the evening prior to this contest, she cried into my arms, proclaiming her undying love for me, telling me that she would forever hold me to be her Lord, regardless of Father’s unwise judgement in today’s contest.”*\n\n*Vapushmati was sobbing.*\n\n*The noble family and everyone else was at a loss for words.*\n\n*Kshatravriddha charged with a guttural cry of fury, brandishing his sword.* \n\n*It was not clear if he meant to attack Ajatashatru or the princess, but Ajatashatru certainly made no effort to defend her.*\n\n*“Kshatravriddha!” cried Queen Kosala Devi at her son, breaking out of her stupor, and the said prince stopped in his tracks, fuming in indignance.* \n\n*“But if despite all your pretenses, brother,” Ajatashatru continued, heedless to the hurt that his words caused to the woman who hailed him as her savior, “You are yet willing to marry woman defiled by me, then I shall myself throw her at your feet. Truly, I care very little for her myself, and only seduced her to spite you, the favourite son of our idiot father.”*\n\n*“Ajatashatru!” cried Queen Chellana, deciding to put an end to her own son’s tirade. “If what you say is true, you have committed a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden, against the honour of your brother, against the honour of our tribe—”*\n\n*“YOU speak to me of honour and chastity?” snapped Ajatashatru. “YOU, mother? You were a princess of Vaishali, and yet you married a barbarian man whom you despised in order to secure his favour towards your kingdom. There is a word we have, for women who sell their bodies in exchange for favours!”*\n\n*Bimbisara’s eyes were colder than the iciest peaks of the Himalayas. Queen Chellana rose, shocked beyond words to so much as chastise her son—*\n\n*“And was it not a grave crime against the chastity of this maiden to murder her family before her eyes?” Ajatashatru continued, a perverted grimace on his face, “To chain her and parade her through the streets of Rajagriha, to announce to every beggar and criminal of this country that he too may have an opportunity to make her his sex slave if he can chop down a tree in one hit?”*\n\n*“Enough!” cried King Bimbisara.* \n\n*But Ajatashatru continued.* \n\n*“Do you know how I would chop down a tree, father?”* \n\n*He held out his left hand, and one of his attendants scrambled over, bowing before him and bestowing him with a bag of jingling coins. Ajatashatru then strode towards Kshatravriddha, unbothered by the unsheathed sword in eldest prince’s hands, and tossed the coins in his brother’s face, letting them scatter onto the ground.*\n\n*Ignoring his brother’s indignant cries, Ajatashatru hollered across the arena:*\n\n*“I would pay my brother – or one of the thousands of other young fools in this kingdom whose strength equals or exceeds his – the small sum of money that he is worth, and take him as my slave. Indeed, much as you purchased your wives, father!”*\n\n*“Enough,” King Bimbisara said again, his voice more authoritative than before. “I have allowed this insanity to progress for far too long. This is a swayamvara, not an auction, and Princess Vapushmati is a bride, not a sex slave.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru folded his hands and gave an exaggerated bow, preparing to leave.* \n\n*Not one person said a word – not the king, not the minister, not the queens, not the princes, and certainly not any of the attendees. The only human sounds that could be heard – if it was even regarded as that – were the sniffles of Princess Vapushmati.*\n\n*They were too thrown off by the bizarreness of his rant and of his antics, and for the most part were just grateful to have him go.* \n\n*Ajatashatru picked up the key that he had earlier tossed to the ground in rage, moved the catapult a little to help his attendants push it out—*\n\n*—and struck the device with one mighty blow, launching a boulder straight at the balcony that housed the royal attendees—*\n\n*—the balcony separated from the rest of the palace—*\n\n*—and crashed into the ground, inclusive of its inhabitants and of the shards of the stone that had shattered against it.*\n\n*The crowd screamed, too shocked to begin to even process the far-reaching consequences of what had just occurred before their very eyes, to even process whether they ought to flee for their own lives. The imperial guard started yelling contradictory orders, and some rushed towards the site of the collapse.*\n\n*A growl sounded, and King Bimbisara’s arm rose from underneath the rubble, pulling himself out.*\n\n*His booming voice came out like his body, bloody and broken:* \n\n*“Capture the traitor!”* \n\n*Some of the Imperial Guard had surrounded Ajatashatru, but they were too frightened, and too out of protocol to know what to do.*\n\n*“As you command, Great King,” said a squadron of the Imperial Guards to Bimbisara, and arrested him.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Any person who has given a girl in marriage without announcing her guilt of having lain with another man shall not only be punished with a fine of 96 panas, but also be made to return any fees and bride-price. Any person receiving a girl in marriage without announcing the blemishes of the bridegroom shall not only pay double the above fine, but also forfeit the fees and bride-price he paid for the bride.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 3.15:14-15.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and fifty-eight years ago.* \n\n*“I gave you a chance, father,” Ajatashatru smiled sadly. “I reasoned with you in more ways than I would usually have considered worth my time.”* \n\n*King Bimbisara’s shocked eyes stared back at him, glistening in betrayal and shame at his own upbringing.* \n\n*A small kerfuffle had broken out between the portion of the Imperial Guard loyal to Ajatashatru and the portion that wasn’t. Some princes were slain, others escaped taking heavy casualties to their own guards and demoralized the faction still loyal to Bimbisara, and Ajatashatru immediately ordered the execution of that faction.*\n\n*Several of his closest allies rushed towards him and created a platform to raise him on their shields. Tossing his hair back pridefully and raising his sword to the sky, he beamed at his subjects.* \n\n*“Victory to!—”*\n\n*(Archers brandished at the audience, threatening to shoot those who did not hail the new king.)*\n\n*“—the Magadha king!”*\n\n*“Victory to!—”*\n\n*“—the Magadha king!”*\n\n*The prince – now apparent king – swooped down from where he stood to take Princess Vapushmati in his embrace, pretending to not be offended at her non-participation in the chant.* \n\n*He wiped his wife’s tears.* \n\n*“From today,” he whispered to her, “You are free.”*\n\n*(Everyone else on the other hand)*\n\n*“Victory to!—” “—the Magadha king!”*\n\n*“Victory to!—” “—the Magadha king!”*\n\n*“Victory to!—” “—the Magadha king!”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Author\'s Note:** Obviously, this goes without saying, but Ajatashatru is a bad guy. Please don’t have sex with your slave even if she “consents”, don’t call your mother a prostitute, don’t imprison your father, don’t murder people, and please don’t raze cities to the ground and set Indian civilization back by hundreds of years.\n\nI’m worried about appearing to romanticize his character too much (like news channels romanticizing serial killers or mass-shooters); it’s just hard to write an “evil genius” well without appearing to sympathize with him even when you don’t, because you can’t make him say obvious strawman arguments, like with stupid villains. \n\nActually, his character is based on my interactions with intelligent people who embrace stupid political ideologies. Essentially, they don’t really argue at the object level, but censure that to instead skip straight to the social level and reason towards goals independent of the truth (for academics, these goals are social pressures, not so with Ajatashatru’s character).\n\nPerhaps people are sensible enough to understand that stories can have villains, and I’m just being insecure. I am also making him \\*more\\* evil than he is in the original Buddhist texts, though.     \n\n\\[1\\] *Purusha* – “man”, the primiordal man; *Prakriti* – “nature”; *Sanskriti* (civilization) and in particular the Sanskrit language arose from their union according to the Samkhya philosophy.\n\n\\[2\\] *Shashigupta* – *Shashi* = *Chandra* = moon; *Gupta* = agent, thus “Chandragupta” = “Shashigupta”\n\n\\[3\\] *Arya* – civilized man; in the Arthashastra this is an Indian endonym'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'rlkenj'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rlkenj/the_great_empire_ch_2_mathura_kanda_21_motivated/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Terrible Truths about the Thespian Dilip Kumar'<br />Body: '***Check out this 1982 Stardust article about Dilip Kumar.***\n\nEven though the whole country was disillusioned, seething with fury and utterly disgusted when their darling Dilip Kumar deceived them about his second marriage, it wasn’t long before people forgave, forgot and started making excuses for their idol. Within a couple of months, Dilip Kumar was back on his pedestal.\n\nThe public had literally grown up believing in his legend, fans had lived with stories of his greatness for too long to accept his feet of clay because of just one mistake.\n\nNow however, it’s come to light that Asma was not the legend’s first mistake. It was only the first to be exposed! **The expose, however belated, seems to have aroused the other ‘wronged parties’ who have kept quiet about their suffering all these years, out of fear for themselves and their families.**\n\nToday, there’s no end to the stories shattering the white-washed façade, no restraint in the explosion of the myth of the ex-Sheriff, the actor nonpareil, the perfect family man, the legendary lover, the Godfather of the industry. One (exposed) slip-up has cost the fallen angel his thirty-year-old image!\n\nSo far, the only well-known negative aspect of this Marlon Brando of the Indian screen was that he had the habit of interfering with his scripts, directing his directors and delaying his films. Any filmmaker who signed Dilip Kumar, did so after knowing what to expect from the screen God. Those who resented his encroaching, never worked with him.\n\nBut it hasn’t been such simple and straight dealing always. Very few people are aware that the thespian has time and again deliberately cheated his producers, ruined his directors and put film families out of action for years, even at times, forever…\n\n#Manmohan Desai and his family of filmmakers\n\nManmohan Desai and his family of filmmakers were one of Dilip Kumar’s first victims!\n\nIt is said that Manmohan Desai’s father was one of the industry’s richest producers in his time. In fact, he had so much money, that he used to get his wardrobe specially flown in from the most expensive boutique in Paris! But, he made one mistake – he signed Dilip Kumar for one of his films and with it, he lost everything he had achieved and amassed in life.\n\n&gt;That film never got made. My father almost became a pauper. - Manmohan Desai\n\nAs if his own extravagant demands during and after the film’s making weren’t enough, Dilip Kumar even instigated Saira Banu as a major accomplice in the Desais’ downfall. The producers had signed Saira for their "Bluff Master", a black and white venture, which was supposed to be a quickie. While the film was still on the floors, Saira’s "Junglee" was released and became an all time hit. Immediately the beauty queen and her mother demanded that "Bluff Master" be switched to Technicolor, because Saira Banu had become too big a star for a black and white film.\n\nAt the time, the Desais could neither afford to give in to their heroine’s demands, nor to scrap the film, so they begged and pleaded with Saira to complete the project as it was. The actress turned to her family friend (they weren’t married then), Dilip who insisted that the Desais abide by Saira’s request!\n\nIt took years for the Desais to complete their ‘quickie’. After which, they were not just financially ruined but also completely out of business. This has made Manmohan Desai so bitter about Dilip and Saira, that today he is the only filmmaker who dares to openly declare,\n\n&gt;Dilip Kumar may be a fabulous artiste, the best in the country, but I will never make the mistake of signing him for my film!”\n\n#Chandra Barot (Filmmaker)\n\nAnother filmmaker who is still trying to get back his foothold in the industry, after being back stabbed by his idol, is Chandra Barot.\n\nChandra was more of a family-member in the Yousuf Khan household, than a producer. After he launched his "Master" with the thespian and his begum in the lead, he fell hook, line and sinker under the Dilip Kumar spell. He hung around the legend night and day, played his chauffeur, bodyguard, odd-job man, etc., while Dilip Kumar worked on the script of "Master". Chandra was convinced that as soon as the paper work was done, they would shoot continuously and complete the film at a stretch. Unfortunately, for Barot, Dilip Kumar never completed the script itself!\n\n**Reason:** He never intended to, because he was only using Chandra and his film as a pawn to keep his wife from going back to a full-time career on screen. He had convinced Saira that she should work in just two good films – their home production and "Master".\n\n**Dilip Kumar’s little selfish game cost Chandra Barot his career.** Today, industrywallas mock him on his face, as a filmmaker who starts but never finishes anything. Financiers, distributors, even stars refuse to back his projects. Chandra has lost the credibility and standing he’d built up after Don. Though he doesn’t hit out at the thespian openly, the undercurrent of bitterness is obvious whenever he speaks about Dilip.\n\n&gt;I have wasted a lot of my time on Master, but it couldn’t be helped. How was I to know that I was being taken for a ride?\n\n#Kishore Sharma (Producer)\n\nToday, another producer Kishore Sharma is waiting and sweating it out like Barot, for Dilip Kumar to give the dates and the green signal to start \'Chandragupta Chana kya\', which he had launched at least five years ago!\n\n&gt;I get very upset when I hear people say that my film will never be made. But let me make this one thing very clear, Chanakya is more important to me than an artiste or star. I will definitely make this film with or without Mr. Dilip Kumar.\n\nOf course, he hastily adds that only the thespian fits the role perfectly and that only Dilip Kumar can do full justice to it! And the fact that he has waited so long and pampered every whim and fancy of the best actor, only proves that Sharma has no intentions of replacing Dilip Kumar in his film.\n\n**According to insiders however, the reason why Kishore Sharma is standing by Dilip Kumar is not so much for his suitability to the role, but the power he commands in the industry.**\n\n&gt;Sharma is not an industrywalla. Chanakya is his first film. The man is scared that if he throws Dilip saab out, his only ambition in life (to make this film) will remain incomplete.\n\nIncidentally, Kishore Sharma is not the only one who is afraid of Dilip’s powerful connections. In fact, fear seems to be quite a common feeling amongst the people who’ve fallen into the thespian’s bad books. **It is believed that Dilip Kumar has a lot of friends in the underworld, who act as his bodyguards and protectors whenever he needs them. In fact, industry people insist that Dilip has often used these connections to get even with his ‘enemies’.**\n\n#Iqbal Khan &amp; K. Asif (Brothers-in-law)\n\nHis own brother-in-law Iqbal Khan (son of the late Mehboob Khan) is said to be terrified of the thespian. When his marriage to Dilip’s sister (Saeeda) didn’t work out, Iqbal wanted a divorce. Till today (so many years later), he hasn’t got it because Dilip Kumar is supposed to have threatened to ruin Iqbal if he ever gave ‘talaq’ to his sister.\n\n&gt;Dilip saab is very, very possessive about his family. And he is capable of killing any man who so much as tries to hurt them! - Bollywood Insider\n\nToday, though the couple lives separately, Iqbal continues to provide for his wife. Not only does he pay for her maintenance (including a car) and all her expenses, but he even sends her daily meals (breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner) from his home (above Mehboob Studios) to her brother’s bungalow (where she now lives)!\n\n**However, since Iqbal and his family members were too scared to clarify this, it was difficult to say how far the story was true or exaggerated. But people close to Dilip’s second brother-in-law (K. Asif) insist that the actor had had a big hand in getting the filmmaker beaten up by goondas when the two men fell out with each other.**\n\nReportedly, Dilip could never forgive K. Asif when he betrayed Dilip’s trust in him, and eloped with his sister Akhtar. Even his own family members recall how violent Dilip became when anyone so much as mentioned their names in his presence. That’s why when one night both Asif and Akhtar were brutally beaten up by a masked man, everyone was certain that the goondas had been sent by Dilip Kumar to teach the couple a lesson!\n\nIsmat Chugtai, the well-known Urdu writer who has been extremely close to Dilip Kumar and his family, put\xa0 the Dilip-K. Asif\xa0 showdown in its proper perspective. “I have known Yousuf\xa0 for a long time now,”\xa0 she explained seriously, “and I do recall how furious he was when his best friend ran away with his sister. Yousuf\xa0 does have a terrible temper, and it is\xa0 quite possible that he must have even threatened\xa0 to kill K. Asif\xa0 for what he had done. But I know for sure that Dilip Kumar was not in any way involved in that awful (beat-up) incident. The poor man isn’t even capable of hurting a fly.”\n\n#Begum Para (Sister-in-law)\n\nDilip’s sister-in-law and star of yesteryears, Begum Para, however, didn’t second Ismat Chugtai’s opinion. Though she pleaded complete ignorance where the Asif case was concerned, she insisted that Dilip Kumar was certainly not as innocent as he looked!\n\n"Yousuf is the biggest charmer,” she declared cynically.\n\n&gt;But behind that sweet charm lies the most vindictive man one can ever come across! He never forgets anything, and he always believes in striking back when you least expect him to. Basically, the man is a coward and does not confront his opponent face to face. He always hits out from behind!\n\n**Begum Para was speaking from her own personal experience. The raw deal that she and her children got from her husband’s brother, is something they will never forget.**\n\nWhen Nasir Khan suddenly died of a heart-attack while location hunting for his film Zid, his wife Para was left with the sole responsibility of completing the film. “Our hero Sanjay Khan was more than co-operative,” she recalled.\n\n&gt;He was making his own film, Chandi Sona at that time, but he assured me that he’d give me his dates whenever I wanted them.\n\n&gt;I was deeply touched. But my heroine Saira Banu and her husband saw to it that I never completed the film. Apart from Saira Banu playing games and harassing me for dates, Dilip Kumar played a very dirty game with me\n\n&gt;He went up to all our distributors and convinced them that he would take the responsibility of completing the film his brother had started. Of course, the distributors were extremely happy and felt very reassured with his guarantee. Every time I wanted to shoot and went to the distributors for the finance, I was told that they would talk to Yousuf saab about it, since he had asked them to deal with him directly. But of course, Dilip Kumar made sure he was never available when they needed him! He just disappeared for eight months.\n\nUnder the bahana of helping his poor sister-in-law, he was very discreetly and cunningly cutting off my roots. I was left with no alternative but to shelve my film and go off to Pakistan and live with my mother.\n\nPara still remembered the time she’d gone to say goodbye to Dilip and Saira before leaving the country. "I was told that they were not at home,” she said.\n\n&gt;So the next day, I called up their place in the morning. Saira informed me that her saab could not come on the phone as he was sleeping. I told her that I didn’t know how long I would be in Pakistan and it was just possible that I would never return and that I would like to say goodbye to my brother-in-law. She made me hold on for some time and came back only to tell me that she had tried her best, but he would not get up!\n\nDilip Kumar must have really believed that Para and her kids had quit India for good, otherwise he would’ve never done what he did soon after their departure.\n\n**Begum Para was in for the biggest and the most unbelievable jolt of her life when she unexpectedly returned to India one fine day.**  “Dilip Kumar was having some financial problems because of Ganga Jamuna,” she revealed. \n\n&gt;My husband was the producer of the film and he had given the rights of Ganga Jamuna to one of the distributors. The only way Dilip Kumar could get himself out of the mess was by getting the rights of the film for himself. So, he declared that a trust had been formed (headed by Dilip Kumar and including all his other brothers and sisters) by my husband for the film. How could my husband forget to add his wife’s name and especially those of his three small kids? The fact is that my husband had died intestate. He had made no will. I never thought that the great Dilip Kumar would stoop to this level even if it was to save his own skin.\n\nThe incident embittered the lady to such an extent that when Dilip Kumar later tried to make up by offering to help his brother’s children, Begum Para promptly called him up, and retorted.\n\n&gt;How can you be so presumptuous as to even think that I would want your help for my children?\n\nCan one believe such behavior from a man who has always been the first star to organize charity cricket matches and variety shows for the poor and the needy?\n\n#Saira Banu\n\nIn fact, when he was the Sheriff of Bombay, Dilip Kumar refused to open any exhibition or inaugurate any shop or be the chief guest at any function, unless the organizers donated a certain amount of money to any one of the three charitable institutions he was supporting. But then, like a Yousuf Khan critic puts it -\n\n&gt;It is very easy to be charitable when you don’t have to put in your own money. Dilip Kumar has always loved to project a public image, which is so completely different from his real self!\n\nEven his first begum Saira Banu will confirm this. **"Saab is full of double standards,”** she had said after the Asma-scandal broke out.\n\n&gt;He knows that he has a blind following and he often takes advantage of this to get his own work done. He works so hard on his speeches and sways the masses with them.\n\n&gt;Even I was very impressed with his word. It was only after what he did to me (his second marriage), that I realized how empty and meaningless his speeches were. He never means what he says. His public image and the Yousuf Khan I now know are two completely different identities.\n\n“It’s hard to believe,” continued a Saira Banu campwalla,\n\n&gt;but the great Dilip Kumar is actually an extremely petty man. **Do you know that when Sunil Dutt was made the Sheriff, Dilip Kumar spent sleepless nights?** He was so very upset. How can they make him the Sheriff? What has he achieved so far? What has he done to deserve this post? Dilip cried over and over AGAIN. He could not accept the fact that another film personality could hold the post he once had held! \n\n&gt;But of course, on Mr. Dutt’s face he was the perfect charmer. In fact, he was the first one to send him flowers and a congratulatory message. He was even around when Dutt saab was sworn in as the Sheriff. With all the back slapping and the hugging, one couldn’t even imagine that Dilip Kumar held any grudge against the new Sheriff!\n\n\n#Dilip Kumar’s Heroines\n\nEven women, especially his heroines, weren’t immune from Dilip Kumar’s petty grudges and revenge tactics.\n\n* **Suraiya**\n\nDuring his hey-days, Suraiya was probably the only top actress who didn’t send out feelers for films with him. Initially, intrigued by her indifference, Dilip requested K. Asif to cast them together. Suraiya accepted \'Janwar\', but throughout the shooting, she stayed away from her co-star, ignored all his advances and was on her best professional behaviour.\n\n**Humiliated by her blatant disinterest, Dilip got his own back in a way that fills Suraiya with disgust to this date.**\n\nWhen the actress reported for shooting one day, the director narrated a particular hot scene which she had to perform. Suraiya had to lie flat on her stomach, while Dilip climbed over her back, scratched her passionately and tore her clothes. Asif made the couple do the scene over and over again. It was only later when she spotted the two friends laughing together, that Suraiya caught on that the scene was just Dilip Kumar’s badla on her – it was not in the script and there was no film in the camera during its ‘shooting’! Humiliated and furious, Suraiya stormed out of the sets and right out of the film.\n\n“I never said a word,” Suraiya recalled bitterly.\n\n&gt;I quietly walked out. If I had retaliated, I would have brought myself down to his level. I didn’t want to give him that satisfaction.\n\n* **Nimmi**\n\nBut unlike Suraiya, her contemporary Nimmi didn’t take Dilip Kumar’s advances lying down. During the making of \'Amar\', **Nimmi slapped Dilip right across the face, in front of the whole unit, when he tried to make an ugly pass at her.**\n\nOf course, since the strict no-nonsense Mehboob Khan was the director of the film, Dilip Kumar had no alternative but to quietly bear the public insult and he never got the opportunity to get even with her because Nimmi made sure that she never worked with the thespian again.\n\n* **Waheeda Rehman**\n\nNimmi and Suraiya, however, were the exceptions in Dilip Kumar’s love-life, for as a rule, women were an easy prey for the legendary lover. Waheeda Rehman still hurts when she remembers how Dilip had ditched her almost at the altar!\n\n**Reportedly, Dilip had proposed to her in Madras, but when he had changed his mind later, he didn’t even have the decency to inform her!** Waheeda’s people remember how terribly shocked she was when she read about Dilip’s engagement to Saira Banu in the papers.\n\nThat’s why, the moment the Rehmans heard about Dilip’s second marriage, Waheeda’s sister Saeeda immediately went and told Saira about it. “Of course, I didn’t believe her,” Saira said sheepishly. “I thought that she was only getting her own back at Saab and me.”\n\n“Waheeda was not the only woman Dilip ditched at the last moment when he announced his engagement to Saira,” revealed Begum Para. She spoke of a married Princess he’d been involved with, who even got a divorce from her first husband to marry Dilip.\n\n* **Kamini Kaushal**\n\nIsmat Chugtai added Kamini Kaushal to the list, and insisted that the actress was ready to end her marriage for a permanent relationship with Dilip Kumar, till the thespian backed out at the last moment.\n\n“The two of them were so madly in love with each other,” revealed Ms. Chugtai, who got to see the love couple together while they were co-starring in her film \'Arzoo\'.\n\n&gt;I don’t think Dilip Kumar has ever loved a woman with as much passion as he loved Kamini.\n\nIn fact, Ismat played quite a go between for them because Kamini was always heavily chaperoned by her mother and brother. “They hounded her wherever she went,” explains Ms. Chugtai,\n\n&gt;and did not allow her to exchange a word with Dilip. **My hero was so upset, that he refused to shoot till he could spend more time alone with Kamini.** So, we thought of a plan. We had a big pillar built and we hired a crane to take Dilip, Kamini and the cameraman up. We pretended to shoot a scene there. Actually, there was no film in the camera and the poor cameraman had to spend the whole day looking the other way while Dilip and Kamini held hands and talked to their heart’s content. Of course, the whole drama cost us a lot of money. But we had to do it for our film.\n\n#Madhubala\n\nBut the biggest drama Dilip Kumar played was with the late Madhubala, so it’s hardly surprising that her family still blames him for her death!\n\n**Though the Madhubala-Dilip Kumar affair is almost a forgotten twenty-two year old legend now, her sisters still smart at the way the actor had abused her love for him.**\n\n“Why do you want me to talk about that man and insult my dead sister’s holy spirit?” demands Madhubala’s eldest sister, Mrs. Kaniz Balsara, whenever Dilip’s name is mentioned.\n\n&gt;Only recently, his sister Fauzia who stays opposite us, came over to tell us that her brother had got married a second time and that she was extremely happy about it. I told her point-blank that I wasn’t. If he’s got married a second time to get children, I told her that would never happen. Dilip Kumar will never get an aulad. And the day he gets one, I’ll know that there is no God in this world. Is duniya mein Khuda nahin hai. My sister was literally craving for a child, but she died without bearing one. If Dilip Kumar had married her, this would have never happened. How can he get a child now?\n\n**She insisted that the thespian had made an emotional fool of her sister, for he never had any intentions of marrying her.**\n\n&gt;He expected her to give up wearing silks and chiffon and forced her to wear simple cotton salwar-kameezes.\n\n&gt;My sister obeyed him. He asked her to remove her make-up, tie her hair back in a simple knot, never to use nail polish. My sister agreed. But when he told her that he would marry her only if she promised never to meet her father or her family, my sister burst into tears and told him that we were her blood and that she could never leave us. How can a man who so openly claims to be so very close to his own brothers and sisters, expect another human being to leave her family?\n\n**Mrs. Balsara pointed out that Dilip’s only grouse against their father was that when Dilip asked Madhubala to marry him immediately and stop working, their father had only insisted that she should complete all the films she had in hand first.**\n\n&gt;My father only told Dilip that he would not allow Madhu to ditch her producers. She would not sign any new films, but she had to complete her old commitments. Tell me was he wrong?\n\n&gt;But Dilip Kumar is a very revengeful man. He paid my father back when he made a statement against him in court. Madhu was never able to forgive Dilip for that. She told him that she loved him, but she loved her father too, and she would not allow anyone to insult him in public. Dilip Kumar is a hypocrite.\n\n&gt;He is a man full of double standards. He did not make the same rules for his wife Saira Banu. She was not only allowed to work in films after marriage but, please excuse my language, he even made his biwi dance nanga on screen!\n\n“My sister loved only one man,” she said emotionally.\n\n&gt;Madhu loved Dilip Kumar till the day she breathed her last. The only reason why she married Kishore Kumar was because she wanted to die a suhagan. And the worst thing was that though she knew she was ailing, she wanted to live. After all, she was so young. \n\n&gt;Dilip Kumar could have made her happy, but he left her when she needed him the most. How can people respect such a man? Woh aadmi nahin, kasaai hai! He is responsible for my sister’s death! I for one, wasn’t surprised when he swore on the Koran and lied to Saira. He is capable of anything. How can people sing praises of such a man?\n\n***How indeed, is the question? And the answer is the much admired image, the glorified legend and the perfect myth that have so cleverly camouflaged the ‘truth’ for nearly thirty years!***\n\n\n[Blast from the Past: The Terrible Truths about the Thespian Dilip Kumar](https://tanqeed.com/blast-from-the-past-the-terrible-truths-about-the-thespian-dilip-kumar/)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rldp1t'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rldp1t/the_terrible_truths_about_the_thespian_dilip_kumar/</li>

The September announcement only said this will be in accordance with applicable laws, leaving room for interpretation.\n\nnetwork\n\nZEE is expected to clarify that such a process will not be dilutive to other shareholders. Any purchase will be from the open market at the prevailing market price and comply with India\'s 5% annual creeping acquisition threshold.\n\nIn an October 12 open letter, Invesco had reiterated its support for the ZEE-SPE non-binding term sheet but sought clarity on specifics, especially the non-compete fee and the equity clawback option.\n\n"Will this change the majority control of Sony in the merged entity? Will it involve open market purchases, warrants, or some other financial instrument? If the latter, will said instruments/warrants to the promoter family be priced so as to advantage them at the cost of ordinary shareholders," it had asked in its open letter.\n\nSony will be the sole promoter of the merged entity with shareholders of Sony India owning 53% and those of ZEE holding the rest. Sony shareholders have also agreed to infuse about $1.58 billion.\n\nInvesco Stand\nThe largest investor in ZEE had issues with the no-compete and stake-enhancement parts of the non-binding deal document.\n\n"There have been two principal sticking points - the 2% no-compete fee and the 4-20% clause," said an executive aware of the matter. "While the former could have been structured better, the latter was non-negotiable. No minority shareholder would accept if this leads to their stake getting diluted. There are ways to avoid it like open-market purchases. The least they can do is to put this clause for a separate vote. If they club it with the overall merger problem, it will create issues."\n\nInvesco is hoping to meet the Sony management in the coming days along with legal counsel and seek clarity on the deal, said people with knowledge of the matter. If it\'s satisfied, analysts expect Invesco to soften its position. However, it\'s still not clear what Invesco\'s stand will be on the ongoing litigation.\n\nInvesco and ZEE have been at loggerheads over the removal of directors and the appointment of new ones besides the calling of an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to discuss this. An executive close to Invesco said the onus is on ZEE to withdraw legal proceedings in the Bombay High Court. Still, if the Sony proposal is presented in a shareholder-friendly format, there\'s no reason not to be supportive.'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'rkoux9'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rkoux9/after_byjus_star_networks_takeover_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[REPOST] The tragedy of Yugo Sako, the anime Ramayana, and India’s failure to capitalize on Indic stories as soft power.'<br />Body: ' Edit - This was published on May 7th on this sub. I have edited the text to improve readability, added images and added more sources for credibility.\n\nPre-Script - The tragedy has been partially undone! **We are finally getting a remastered 4k version of Ramayana.** Now respects must be paid to Yugo Sako for the work he did. It will improve bilateral relationships with Japan and encourage Japanese artists towards Indic-centric stories.\n\n# Examples of national policy to use art and culture as soft power across the world\n\nSometime in the first decade of the 21st century, South Korea dedicated **1% of its GDP** to fuel it’s arts and culture scene across the board — a fund of a staggering ***$1 billion***.  This meant it would fund universities, agencies and film studios in  cash and low interest loans to further Korean culture. The main  objective was to increase Korean influence across the world and hence  project it as soft power.\n\nThe policy has been giving bumper harvests in form of critical acclaim and money. In the last year itself, **South Korea brought in** **$85 BILLION** **as a result of this policy.**\n\nThis  can be seen everywhere. Parasite won the best picture at the Oscars in  2020. A Korean actor was nominated for best actor this year. K-pop is  growing as a craze. K-drama is catching up.\n\nThey even have a quota system in Korean Cinema, where theaters are required to show a fixed number of Korean films and only after that imported movies.\n\nThis policy was thought to duplicate American and Japanese policies.\n\nJapanese  anime is all pervading today, and if you see any movie by a famous director, for example Hayao Miyazaki, Japanese culture is highlighted in  every movie. Ditto with American soft power. Comics of Captain America, the novel The Hunt for red October, movie Argo are all examples of how  USA pushes its cultural narrative.\n\n# Erosion of Indic culture from popular sphere\n\nBack  at home, there has been little effort to further Indic art and culture,  and whatever little effort had been made was thwarted by malicious  agencies or fizzed out due to inaction by the Indic wing of the  political spectrum.\n\nThe  best example of this is the anime Ramayana, The Legend Of Prince Rama.  The film’s creator, Yugo Sako was a self professed Hindu, being an avid  follower of Indic stories. The anime itself is beautiful, replete with  melodious and [memorable songs ](https://youtu.be/w0arEtmlphQ)and  dazzling fight sequences showcasing Sri Rama’s and Ravana’s military  prowess. Additional points can be given for the film’s dialogue that has  been crafted in pure Hindi, with no adulteration with Urdu. The anime had few flaws, the immediate being the color of Sri Rama himself. He was  portrayed as fair skinned, when he was quite dark in color. But that  can be easily overlooked since it captures Sri Rama’s essence  accurately.\n\nThe  movie was doomed since it’s conception. It was supposed to be  co-produced by Japanese studio and Indian government. But the then  Congress government did not want any part in it, because of the Rama  Janmabhoomi movement led by L K Advani. The troubles didn’t end there.\n\nAfter  making the anime, the release was halted by Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who  thought that a cartoon depiction was an insult to Sri Rama. This doomed  the film to never release in India.\n\nAdd  to this, the Hollywood release also fell through. **The film cost a whopping 131 crores to make, the highest budget cinema by Indian film industry ever.**  It had a stellar cast consisting of Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame,  and James Earl Jones of Star Wars repute.\n\n# Yugo Sako,  who was as good as a Hindu Vaishnava, wanted to make many more movies on Indic  history. He died in 2012, writing a movie about Sri Krishna. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9l3k8xd2n681.jpg?width=1306&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db162e641d4a764b9a4a9d2ab52441d06a54491\n\nThere has  been no awards by Indian government towards Sako nor any appreciation by  the film fraternity here.\n\nAnother  good example would be the Chanakya TV series on Doordarshan. Given a  run of just 47 episodes by Doordarshan, it still made a huge impact with  its historical accuracy, chaste Hindi and cerebral monologues by the  creator, director and actor Chandra Prakash Dwivedi.\n\nDwivedi spent **9 years** researching the history only for Doordarshan to axe the  show because they termed it as propaganda. TV shows like Tipu Sultan  were however permitted to continue.\n\n**It is interesting to note that it is alleged that the series was** **rejected** **by Bhaskar Ghose, the father of Sagarika Ghose.**\n\nChandra Prakash Dwivedi himself has highlighted this problem in  a lecture during a RSS conclave where he highlighted that the Indic  literature was enjoyed and consumed by more foreigners than Indians,  Shakuntala being a prime example.\n\n **He insisted that Hindus have to stem this cultural rot, even as they fight with external threats.**\n\n# A policy change was needed yesterday.\n\nDwivedi is right. The youth of this generation have all heard the hackneyed  expression -” influenced by Western culture”. But what real option do the youth have when there is no Indic literature to consume across ages.  Kids outgrow Panchatantra tales as soon as they go beyond 10 years of  age. Ramayana and Mahabharata are viewed as spiritual texts. The  awe-inducing feats of Sri Rama are overlooked for his spiritual  qualities. The youth get bored with it and soon fall prey to Western culture.\n\nAnd  so begins the phase where wearing dhotis is uncool, touching feet of  elders is “cringe”, lying prostrate in front of a deity is impossible.  Visiting a temple is out of question.\n\nThis erosion has to be stemmed by the government. Modi has identified this problem and has spoken about producing video games with Indic stories, but no more intent is shown in terms of policy.\n\nMeanwhile Bollywood continues its unabashed attempts to malign Hinduism, demonize  it’s rituals, and hence brainwash a whole generation.\n\nA  national policy is needed to transform Indic texts into a popular form  and then project it as soft power. Yoga itself is not enough. Especially  how it has been desecrated as a gymnastic exercise by the west instead of being a spiritual exercise to find “God”.\n\nYugo Sako’s second movie was supposed to be called Lord Krishna — The  Celestial Cowherd. It’s depressing to know that it never saw the light  of the day. ~~We do not even have an HD version of Ramayana anime, forget a  remastered version.~~  \n\nLet’s  hope that the government wakes up before Indic history actually becomes  a myth and we are consumed by an identity crisis caused by cultural  bankruptcy.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources - \n\nHow Korea allocated a whopping $2 billion to promote Korean stories through film, songs and art -\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean\\_wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_wave)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow the policy paid off monetarily for Korea -\n\n[https://financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/how-korea-became-the-worlds-coolest-brand?r](https://financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/how-korea-became-the-worlds-coolest-brand?r)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA wiki article explaining the Korean quota system for movies - \n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen\\_quotas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_quotas)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA wiki article on Yugo Sako - \n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo\\_Sako](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo_Sako)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChandraprakash Dwivedi\'s lecture on improving involvement in indigenous arts and culture -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLNFeTFf\\_5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLNFeTFf_5g)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow Modi has spoken about developing video games with Indic themes -\n\n[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-26-indias-prime-minister-appeals-for-games-based-on-indian-culture-and-folk-tales](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-26-indias-prime-minister-appeals-for-games-based-on-indian-culture-and-folk-tales)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA link to the trailer of the remastered Ramayana anime -\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOKKB9yvVjw&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOKKB9yvVjw&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow the Doordarshan TV series "Chanakya" was axed by commies -\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/what-chanakya-was-rejected-by-doordarshan/articleshow/74933853.cms?from=mdr](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/what-chanakya-was-rejected-by-doordarshan/articleshow/74933853.cms?from=mdr)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'rkgb8c'<br />Score:249<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rkgb8c/repost_the_tragedy_of_yugo_sako_the_anime/</li>

Both Padmaavat and Ram - Leela promote suicidal ideation and speak about how brave it is to sacrifice someone's life. Are we promoting suicidal ideation? It is not just these movies in question but so many other movies and TV shows where people talk about how saving their virginity/ honor is more important than staying alive. \n\nI am bringing this up because I have religiously consumed this kind of content all my life. When life got hard/ my parents tried to control me, I used to hurt myself to feel in control. I always thought I don't know how bad being assaulted is so I cannot judge people for ending their life. However, I have recently been sexually assaulted by a trusted family member which I never thought would happen to me in my life. I have been seeking therapy and have actually realized that living through it takes more courage than ending life. I recently watched padmaavat again and saw the Jauhar scene and realized how morally wrong ending one's life is much less 30,000 lives together. \n\nBefore people say that it's a movie and I should treat it as such, we the Indian community as a whole do not treat movies as movies and make them very personal. For example, we have alcohol and smoking disclaimers before every movie. So why do we not have a trigger warning and an introductory post saying that ending life is wrong and people should seek professional help?\n\nThank you\n\nL"<br />Author: 'Competitive_Guard289'  id: 'rk90le'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rk90le/trigger_warning_is_it_okay_to_promote_suicidal/</li>

But I am not sure if my friend actually knows much about what this actually is.

He mostly spoke about how much money I can be making and stuff like that. \n\nI asked my friend and he said the company is called Quest International. I did some reasearch, but could not find Quest International. But I found qnet which sounded very similar to Quest according to the discription the mentor had given me. \nI also saw that many people in Banglore had protested against this company because it made them loose so much money. \n\nWhat i would like to know is, has any Indians here came across this company called Quest international ?

Also, if you find any better solution or a flaw do suggest.\n\n"The solution is pretty simple. I\'ve this idea, so have you been to those Piracy Movie Websites?\nIf not, what they do is that they host the movies/series on a server and then embed the player on their website and let people play it. The main reason for doing that in their case is that if their website gets taken down, the content also remains there moreover they don\'t face legal action.\n\nAnyways you might be wondering what this has to do with Twitter Censorship. So, twitter is probably where all the action is, where the news breaks and If we\'re being honest a seperate alternative to twitter is a very difficult idea, instead of creating a platform where we do things entirely different, we should create a website like thise Piracy Movie Websites, and then embed tweets (Twitter does allow third party clients) while also embedding content from Koo, or whatever next Indigenous thing we develop. This way a user from Koo could Interact with someone from Twitter. Meanwhile, the user would also have the choice to host his content wherever he want. \n\nI know this is just a rough idea, and a lot of things needs to be worked out, I just put it out there in case someone is interested by this idea because let\'s face it censorship is not going anywhere, it\'ll only increase.

      <li>Title::: 'Modus Operandi of Neo-Colonialism'<br />Body: 'Inspired by a thread on effects of colonialism I decided to jot this down and make a separate thread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistoric context:  \n\n\n1. Post WW2 US emerged as a super power, but they didn’t have colonies.\n2. Also colonialism simply turned out to be a costly affair as troops returned to the colonies, started demanding independence, and started revolting. Thereby increasing both the financial and the human cost of maintaining colonies.\n3. Exploitation of former colonies could continue under the garb of capitalism. (I’m not going on an anti capitalist rant here, but for capitalism to work there needs to be some semblance of equality in the starting conditions. Unbridled capitalism definitely leads to exploitation.)\n\nSo while UN was supposedly against colonialism, but they and the Bretton woods institutions in a way promoted Neo colonialism.\n\nToday WTO and the climate conferences are being used to promote it.\n\nWTO: when industries were in a nascent state in Britain, they employed protectionist trade policies to develop their industry (e.g tariff on Indian goods in Britain were over 60%, while British goods in India were nearly free from tariff). When developing nations today try something similar, even if the rates are reciprocal, they face threat of expulsion from WTO. Therefore enormously increasing barriers of entry and perpetuating western hegemony. Then there is the infamous case of the US attempting to misuse TRIPS in order to patent fuckin Haldi (turmeric)!\n\nUNFCCC: There is no denying that western nations are responsible for the degradation of environment and GHG emissions historically. They did this while exploiting people in the colonies and greatly benefited economically while polluting.\n\nThe Kyoto protocol necessitated that these developed nations start cutting emissions and the carbon trading system was born.\n\nThey failed miserably to meet the targets, and voted to absolve themselves from any penalties.\n\nThen came another agreement which stated that developed nations will fund $100 billion per year to finance green technology/infrastructure in the developing world.\n\nThey obviously did not follow through on it and even are holding off discussions on the Same in both Paris and Glasgow.\n\nNot only that, but they are refusing to acknowledge the emission cuts /carbon sequestration done by the developing countries according to Kyoto protocol, by not letting it be carried forward to Paris’s NDCs.\n\nSo in a way they want to put excessive burden of cleanup on the same people who were exploited while the west created the mess. I‘m not suggesting that we trash the environment like they did. But our environment policy shouldn’t come at the cost of poverty alleviation or development in India, and the cost must be borne by nations with high historic emissions.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on UNCLOS and their EEZs!\n\nThe actual area under control, including seas, puts the size of France and India at nearly the same level (I’m not a100% sure but I reckon France is larger)\n\nSay they have a tiny island half a world away from their mainland, then they reserve the right to exploit all resources within 200 nautical miles of the island shore.\n\nPractices like this are the reason why massive European trawlers patrol the equatorial African coast. These trawlers cause entire ecosystem destruction, leaving biological deserts in the oceans. The small native boats are no match for these trawlers. Therefore traditionally fishing communities have been pushed inward to hunt bush meat, causing diseases like Ebola.\n\nThis was just from 3 international treaty organisations. Literally every treaty organisation you look at closely will reveal some or the other aspect of Neo colonialism!\n\nAnd this does not even include indirect actions like controlling media/global narratives to influence members of civil society to act against their own national interests in these matters.'<br />Author: 'creganODI'  id: 'rifcas'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rifcas/modus_operandi_of_neocolonialism/</li>

Search for 1995 report — which had multiple copies — began around time of Art 370 abrogation'<br />Body: 'https://twitter.com/bhartijainTOI/status/1471681569580478465\n\n&gt;As the Delimitation Commission gets ready to discuss the proposed allocation of constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir districts with its five MPs, it is learnt that the draft delimitation proposal was prepared without examining the exact basis of the last delimitation award given in 1995, as the relevant report has mysteriously gone missing and could not be not furnished to the panel headed by Justice (Retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai.\nAccording to sources, the current Delimitation Commission had sought the report of its predecessor panel, presented by chairperson Justice K K Gupta in 1995, from the J&amp;K government around a month back. The purpose was to study the basis on which it had allocated the seats to the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, so as to assess and correct any anomalies in the current exercise. However, the UT administration reverted saying that the report of Justice K K Gupta commission — set up under the J&amp;K Constitution and J&amp;K Representation of the People Act — was not traceable in either the state assembly, state government records or archives. As a result, the current Delimitation Commission had to make do with whatever records and figures of the last delimitation exercise are available in the public domain — including the notification relating to the 1995 delimitation award — to put together its first delimitation draft.\nA source indicated that the search for Justice K K Gupta panel report began much earlier, around the time of abrogation of Article 370 in J&amp;K on August 9, 2019. However, the report was nowhere to be found, leaving officials baffled as to how such an important document, which may have had more than one copy, vanished from all records. An official even indicated that it may be several years and, possibly, decades since the report is missing.\nInterestingly, all the elections in J&amp;K since 1996 have been held based on the delimitation award given in 1995.\nThe tentative allocation of seats worked out by the panel led by Justice (Retd) Desai with chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and chairman of J&amp;K state election commission as ex-officio members, takes into account facts gathered during its tour of J&amp;K in July this year. Around 280 representations were received from various groups and 900 persons appeared before the commission.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1995-jk-delimitation-report-missing-data-in-public-domain-helps-new-draft/articleshow/88328162.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOIIndiaNews'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'ridsxk'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ridsxk/bharti_jain_big_report_of_last_delimitation_done/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India urgently needs to arrest the brain drain plaguing the country and incentivize STEM fields like the Russians to retain talent to do original research and development in India'<br />Body: '&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1990s, when the USSR finally broke apart, the state machinery tasked with keeping their scientists in check also was systematically dismantled. And with the KGB’s downfall, many scientists took the opportunity to defect in the cloud of dust. The state machinery was focused on the dozen countries breaking apart and not on the talent that was flying across the ocean to USA. This lead to one of the deepest brain drains since the Axis powers were defeated. **Over 10,000 scientists defected, abandoning their posts.**  Soviet scientists had put a man and satellites in space before the Americans, had somehow replicated the Manhattan Project by simply copying and had kept up the military advancements almost neck to neck.\n\nThen came the drought that affected Russian scientific community deeply. An exodus like this is always detrimental to the home country but is incredibly beneficial to the destination country like the USA. USA again filled their science department with foreign scientists, just like they filled after the second World War, cherry picking scientists from the Nazi divisions and Japanese Unit 731. As a result, America has advanced way ahead of the rest of the world in science and technology, because all the applications that find a use in military and space, usually trickle down for commercial and consumer applications a few years down the line.\n\nThe same thing is happening to India too. But because of such a deep and wide talent pool, where one mark can decide whether a candidate gets into a top IIT or a middle NIT, we have not felt the repercussions. Or we have chosen to ignore it since the jugaad has been keeping us afloat all these years.\n\nTop tech giants in USA have Indian-origin executives. So many CEOs. So many scientists who work at high levels. They could have been retained and nurtured here. The problem presents itself on many levels, but the most impactful of them is that Indian government does not spend a lot on Research and Development. And I mean novel Research and Development. There has to be a state policy to attract young scientists, from India and abroad to come and participate in research projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Russian case is very inspiring in this aspect of re-invigoration its research and development field – \n\nAfter the downfall of USSR in 1990s, the spending for Science and Technology plummeted. Entire laboratory complexes and whole cities dedicated to Biology and Physics were abandoned. These lost cities are still standing with their derelict buildings a stark reminder of the downfall. \n\nIn 2000, 10 years later, the number of original research papers published by Russia was still almost the same as before. Nothing had changed. Reports started pouring in saying how Russia has been falling behind in the space of Science and Technology.\n\nIn 2010, 167 scientists wrote to Vladimir Putin that he needs to take action, or Russia will suffer the effects of this “lost generation”. 10,000 scientists lost is no joke. The effects it had on the economy and progress is immense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How did Russia then spring back from the drought? The answer lies not just in the increase of funding, because that is a different matter, but the effectiveness in which the money is spent – \n\n1. **Academic salaries were raised across the board.** This was especially needed because an academic needs to be comfortable financially.\n2. Scientists, whose research did not produce results were discarded. Only researchers who produced real science were retained and rewarded handsomely in forms of grants.\n3. New research facilities were built, including a state of the art quantum physics laboratory and an ion collider.\n4. The establishment of Russian Science Foundation, an independent organization whose sole purpose is to make sure advancements are made. Grants and supergrants are given to deserving researchers. All the red tape scientists had to cut through to get grants was removed completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe results are there for everyone to see. The number of quality research papers have increased. Number of research papers cited by international peers has also increased.\n\nThe important thing to note here is that the funding is the same. Russia spent around 1.5% of GDP on Research and Development, and spends around 1.2% today.\n\nWe can see that the funding has actually decreased. The focus is the implementation here. If the implementation is well managed, a country can extract better academic research out of its talent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# India faces all the problems Russia faced – \n\nIndia spends a minuscule **0.7% of GDP on Research and Development.**\n\nA lot of this money is tied up in bureaucracy. Grants are awarded according to seniority, and not according to the merit of the research.\n\nThe private sector, just like Russia does not contribute to the nation’s progress in this field. It is the state that has to fund the research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# There is a silver lining to the whole problem though –\n\nIndia has raised the number of original research articles published in international scientific journals.\n\nIndia has risen to the **9th place in the number of patents filed** across the world.\n\nThe number of researchers has **increased to 255 in 2017 from 110 in 2000**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut these cannot be taken as definite progress. We are still losing too many talented researchers to foreign countries. \n\nIndia needs to establish a dedicated body to award research grants to deserving academics. They should not be discriminated according to their seniority. A young scientist with real talent and drive will always produce better research than an old crony who has warmed his seat for the past few decades.\n\nIndia needs to increase the R&amp;D expenditure. In comparison the BRICS countries all spend a little more than 1.1% on R&amp;D. Brazil spends 1.3%, China spends 2.1% and Russia spends 1.2%.\n\n**Private companies have to be encouraged to spend on research and development. This is critical.**\n\nThe only reason USA, Germany, France and Japan are so ahead in the field is because the private companies help the state foot the bill for original research and development. This means private infrastructure and dedicated department focused on developing new science and technology. Until the private companies come on board and help the state monetarily, the way is very tough. It is important they do their part because they are usually the first in line to mass produce a product after the research and development has already been done.\n\nThe private companies HAVE to pitch in.\n\nAnd the government has to encourage Private enterprise involvement. It’s a symbiotic relationship that will yield great dividends in the future.\n\nHow long will we depend on foreign companies to manufacture our jet engines? We still import most of the critical systems from abroad. When will we see an indigenous processor manufacturing company that sells to foreign countries?\n\nThis has to become a real focus now that social concerns of cleanliness and implementation of basic amenities are in place. Infrastructure projects are also in the right hands. It is time we finally gave the attention towards research and development. It’s a long time coming. And it has waited long enough.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources –\n\nMegagrants for Russian and foreign scientists –\n\n[https://fp.hse.ru/en/220](https://fp.hse.ru/en/220)\n\nHow Russia is aiming to bring scientists back home –\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00753-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00753-7)\n\nHow Russia even has compromised on attracting foreign scientists and researchers –\n\n[https://www.chronicle.com/article/russia-creates-plan-to-recruit-foreign-researchers/](https://www.chronicle.com/article/russia-creates-plan-to-recruit-foreign-researchers/)\n\nHow US Government heavily regulates science research to keep the advancements in the country–\n\n[https://ori.hhs.gov/content/chapter-1-rules-road-government-regulation](https://ori.hhs.gov/content/chapter-1-rules-road-government-regulation)\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/126157a0](https://www.nature.com/articles/126157a0)\n\nRussia’s downfall –\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-research-idUSTRE60P14A20100126](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-research-idUSTRE60P14A20100126)\n\n[https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/russia-s-lost-science-generation/story-gNocWlbtVU26XBI59xH6hI.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/russia-s-lost-science-generation/story-gNocWlbtVU26XBI59xH6hI.html)\n\nIndia’s expenditure on R&amp;D – \n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/nearly-0-7-pc-of-gdp-spent-on-rd-strengthening-of-st-infra-from-2014-15-to-2018-19-govt/articleshow/85212365.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/nearly-0-7-pc-of-gdp-spent-on-rd-strengthening-of-st-infra-from-2014-15-to-2018-19-govt/articleshow/85212365.cms)\n\nThe silver lining –\n\n[https://dst.gov.in/indias-rd-expenditure-scientific-publications-rise](https://dst.gov.in/indias-rd-expenditure-scientific-publications-rise)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'rhq2us'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rhq2us/india_urgently_needs_to_arrest_the_brain_drain/</li>
