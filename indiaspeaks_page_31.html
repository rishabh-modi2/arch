Let's be honest. Solar and Wind energy can't solve our energy needs alone. Also they aren't that environmental friendly as they are said to be or made us to believe it. Are our scientists even pursuing the programme right now? I know many of our scientists are getting disappeared/killed suspiciously, organizations being set up to halt our projects and we are being pressurized through foreign influence but this research is necessary for us. Homi Bhabha was a true visionary and I think we are now in a position to accelerate the programme. If anyone have any input to share please do.

It is situated in the campus of National Academy of Indian Railways. It was started in 2018, funded by the Indian Railways.   \n\n\nWe follow a trimester system. Each being 2.5 - 3 months long. Because of the pandemic, the last trimesters of the first and the second year were done completely online. The classes were done online. All the professors had laid out their assessment criteria, and we had 15-20 class tests, 5-10 presentations and assignments spread across the 6 weeks of classes, all of which was considered as internal assessment.   \n\n\nOur classes ended mid June and our final assessment were supposed to be held in the 3rd week of August, in the campus. However, because of the rising covid cases, this was scrapped and our final exams were also supposed to be taken online. However, last week it was announced that these final assessments will not contribute to our CGPA and the only grades we would get are "Pass and Fail".   \n\n\nToday, It was announced that neither internal nor external assessment would count towards the CGPA. The entire trimester would be graded either "Pass" or "Fail". Essentially nullifying all the tests, assignments taken before hand. Furthermore, we are told if we want our tests to be graded, we need to give a pen/paper exam if and when we return to the campus. Considering that our next trimester(August to October will also be online), there\'s no assurances about reopening of any college in the forthcoming few months, it feels highly disadvantageous for the students, and it adds to all the pre-existing stress because of the crisis.   \n\n\nI ask you all for recommendations and thoughts. If possible, please add what can be done to the below mentioned points:   \n\n\n1) Is it justified for the university to change the grading criteria 2-3 months after the assessments were taken- without any consultation or feedback from the students?  \n\n\n2) Considering that there is no student welfare body, committee in the campus, how can we raise this issue in a way that doesn\'t backfire?'<br />Author: 'gaandmirchi'  id: 'i4tsob'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i4tsob/institute_nullifies_all_grading/</li>

But if this post uplifts at least a few, I think I will be happy and proud. To start with, I am a Jain, many say it’s a branch of Hinduism, but I don’t consider it a branch of it (no offense, it’s my opinion). Today, after the inauguration of the temple and the Court’s decision, every one decided to celebrate the victory of Hindutva and Hinduism, which I am definitely not against. However, what I am against is the hate shown to the Muslim community of India. I see so many trolls telling Muslims to leave the country if they don’t like it, that they need to be ethnically cleansed, that Mohammed didn’t follow what he himself preached, etc. Also, these are the same people who spoke about Black Lives Matter and posted those black screens to show solidarity. Hypocrisy much? Why are we now shut when Muslims are being hated so much? Don’t they matter? \nSee, I am not against people following their religion, I just believe that hatred never comes from religion. I believe that whether Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Muslim, any one, we are all taught to love and understand others and show our humanity. That we are all preachers of peace and if you justify your hate for others using a religion, then, I am so sorry you haven’t really understood your own religion. Hatred never comes from any religion, I believe. \nWe are all Indians essentially. We are few of the people in the world who get to eat different regional varieties everyday, who have friends of so many different religious backgrounds, who are known to be very diverse and we are proud of that and therefore we say Unity in Diversity. We are all people from one place, and when we take our pledge we say we are all brothers and sisters. And you know what? That’s what makes us stronger, that’s what makes us a great example for the rest of the world, that’s what makes India have great soft power in geopolitical context. \n\nI have an attempt to stir a conversation of this situation and only that.\n\nThanks 🙏 \nJai Hind🇮🇳'<br />Author: 'theibenglishco'  id: 'i4mugd'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i4mugd/i_feel_ashamed_today_of_the_india_i_am_in/</li>

Institutes of National Importance receive special recognition and funding from the Government of India.\n\nAs of 2020, there are 155 institutes, declared as Institutes of National Importance under a distinct Act of Parliament. These INIs include 23 IITs; 15 AIIMSs; 20 IIMs; 31 NITs; 25 IIITs; 7 IISERs, 7 NIPERs; 5 NIDs; 3 SPAs; 5 central universities; 4 medical research institutes and 10 other specialized institutes.\n\n**Numbers (Modi Government Vs Previous Governments)**\n\nTotal Number of Institutes of National Importance from till 2014 (till UPA) is 111\n\nTotal Number of Institutes of National Importance today is 155.\n\nThis is almost 40% increase in 6 years compared to total number of institutions setup / converted to premier institutions since Independent India (67 years)\n\n**Few Stats Below:**\n\n**1.** **Agricultural Science (100% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 1\n\nNow - 2\n\n**2.Design (includes NIDs) (400% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 1\n\nNow - 5\n\n**3. Engineering (includes IITs and NITs) (14.58% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 48\n\nNow - 55\n\n**4. Information Technology (includes IIITs) (177% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 9\n\nNow - 25\n\n**5. Management (includes IIMs) (53% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 13\n\nNow - 20\n\n**6. Medicine (includes AIIMs) (46% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 13\n\nNow - 19\n\n**7. Sciences (includes IISER) (28.57% Increase)**\n\n2014 and Before - 7\n\nNow - 9\n\n**Note:** Just for the sake of discussion, if you exclude 2014, 2015 and 2016 years from the charts. *Still the increase is close to 20% which means 1 out of every 5 institute of national importance started only in the last 6 years.*\n\n*On the Contrary, this logic doesn\'t make sense because most of the institutions which started in 2014, 2015 and 2016 started off in temporary campuses especially new IIMs and IITs which are now getting permanent campuses constructed by the present Government. Therefore the figure of 40% in terms of funding, construction &amp; infrastructure for the new institutions still holds true.*\n\n*Forget about 20% and 40%, even if the figure is close to 10% for the argument sake, it is still in impressive. More you move up, more numbers you need for the same percentage change.*\n\n**References via** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes\\_of\\_National\\_Importance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_National_Importance)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhatever criticism Modi gets or whatever ridiculous statements BJP members make regarding education, when it comes to numbers, they have done extremely well in increasing the number of premier institutions in India.

So here’s some real insider details :\n\n[Common Sense Disclaimer : If an answer claims “Sri Devi’s death was a planned murder”, be sure that it is fake. Boney Kapoor is an intelligent man. Do you really think that if he planned his celebrity wife’s death, random industry crew would know of it? If the police says it was accidental, believe it &amp; move on. The most an actual ‘industry insider’ can tell you is if Boney doesn’t care if she died if they have seen him indulging in girls, parties, etc. I haven’t so I won’t say anything. Sri Devi was obsessed with looking perfect which led to her having an openly weird &amp; unhealthy lifestyle. So I don’t doubt if her heart actually gave up. The same goes for “Priyanka-Nick are a fake PR couple”. Priyanka too is an intelligent woman! Even if they are fake, only their families &amp; managers would know, not anonymous ‘insiders’.]\n\nI have seen the Student sequel rushes and that younger girl can’t act to save her life. This when sadly, she's not half as well behaved as her father.\nIndian’s only true crossover star to Hollywood didn't drop out of a big ‘bhai’ movie due to her wedding. She had realized that she couldn't avoid giving out compulsory sexual ‘favours’ in this project during outdoor shoots.\nThe chocolate boy actor who got a young bride from Delhi has been caught cheating multiple times by his wife. The latest one with his latest young costar. The reason why most of his previous girlfriends dumped him. Also, his wife insists on sitting for his script readings and giving ‘suggestions’ when she doesn’t know anything about anything. He already doesn’t get a lot of offers, and this is pissing people off even more.\nThe recently married power couple, who had a comical number of receptions, had a open relationship till now. Nothing wrong, but they go about town preaching loyalty &amp; monogamy. Let's see if the marriage is open or exclusive. Also, the wife’s team is very pissed that the wedding didn't make her #1 on Instagram. Wife is as addicted to publicity as husband is to powder.\nStree girl is not as naive as she acts in public. She is just as bitchy &amp; high maintenance as any other actor, and even has a fun thing on with her horror-comedy costar who acts very principled &amp; committed to his GF in public. Also, she fakes a teenager accent in public but talks like a normal over-30 year old behind camera.\nThe only crossover actress has given sleepless nights to another blue-eyed Miss World who has spent years making Indians believe that she's the only world renowned Indian beauty. Her ego is majorly fractured that this crossover is landing actual roles(even if in flops), magazine covers, &amp; recognition, when all she had was fake casting rumours planted by her own PR. (She even got threatened by a Hollywood production house to be sued once). She is desperately looking for things to be in news again.\nThis blue eyed lady’s sister-in-law is a wild child legally separated from her husband due to her wild ways. She also had an affair with a green eyed superstar who is her childhood friend. Her new fashion &amp; writing ventures are ways to justify her living in Mumbai &amp; fulfill her hunger to be in front of the camera (a wish crushed by daddy dearest in her youth)\nAll of ‘Bhai’s charities are a sham. A publicity move suggested by his lawyers. Others donate much more without publicizing. He doesn’t even donate any of his own money.\nBrahmastra pair were actually set up by the producer as promotion tactic. But he &amp; his ‘adopted’ daughter jumped on the opportunity to make it serious to secure her future with film’s royal family &amp; seal her spot in the big leagues by dating a ‘serious’ actor. The actor has a ‘whatever’ approach to it. After their sad+disinterested pictures leaked from the set, the producer &amp; their PR planned many joint public spottings. A fake doctor visit for the girl’s fake injury, airport walks, award shows, etc. It's sad because they are both children of fractured marriages. It might end up in marriage. Their movie is a 3 part series so producer won't allow a breakup, the girl is too ambitious/cunning to give up on the guy’s lineage &amp; wealth, and the guy has a bad rep with women. (Even though his ex was cheating on him with her costars too, her actions of betrayal never went public).\n#MeToo gave a loooot of scares. To everyone who had made sure there was NO way for young girls &amp; boys to get ANY work, unless they give out ‘favours’ for months(Literally everyone apart from Barjatya’s). Sadly the public soon lost interest &amp; things slowly went back to normal. Pray that those bastards get what he deserves &amp; the public pressure builds again. All the allegations made public till now align with the accuseds’ behavior that I have personally seen or heard of over many years.\nA lot of married, ‘sanskari’ people reached out to their past victims who became very successful or might have proof. Take crores to shut up or their careers will be destroyed. Male victims were being paid more.

To be sure, racism against Indians does still exist, and will continue to interfere with our progress. We are still a minority, but a growing one. \n\nIn the west, the swastika is still considered to be a symbol of Nazi atrocities, despite it origination being in Hinduism, and its true meaning representing spirituality and divinity. It is one of the holiest symbols in Hinduism. In India, you will find the front door of many houses adorned with this symbol. \n\nThe usage of the Swastika to symbolize hate is one of the strongest, most egregious, and enduring cases of appropriation and white privilege. It has literally been twisted to symbolize the most polar opposite beliefs than its true form. How do we begin to change this? it seems nobody seems to discuss this in North America. \n\nAmericans who fly the Confederate flags, also leverage the Swastika to demonstrate their commitment to intolerance and pride in their racist beliefs. Are there advocacy groups, political figures, historians, public figures, or others who can start to change this?

      <li>Title::: '[IndiaSpeaks Megathread] : Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Bhoomi Pujan'<br />Body: 'Shree Ram is not just merely a name but a symbol of Bharat and Bharatiya civilisation. Ram naam unites people from all languages and geographies in India. This unification transcends castes and creeds because of the respect for the values which he stood by and sacrificed so much. The reverence and presence for the pan Indian deity can be gauged in the names, games, folk drama, wedding songs, greetings, literature, stories and several other avenues. The tale of Prabhu Shree Ram, the Ramayana, has been retold countless times over millennia across the length and breadth of Bharatavarsha. To name just a few of the retellings of this eternal story -\n\nSri Rama Vijaya by Sankaradeva in Assamese (15th century)\n\nTorave Ramayana by Narahari in Kannada ( 16th century)\n\nGiridhardas Ramayana in Gujarati (19th century)\n\nKrittivasi Ramayana by Krittibas Ojha in Bengali (15th century)\n\nKambaramayana by Kambar in Tamil (12th century)\n\nSri Rangantha Ramayanam by Gona Budha Reddy in Telugu (14th century)\n\nRamacharitamanas by Tulsidas in Awadhi, a dialect of Hindi (16th century)\n\nRam was born at Ayodhya on the banks of the river Sarayu. The site of his birth is held sacred by crores of Indians and there existed a temple dedicated to Ram Lalla, or the infant Ram, at the site. In the years 1528-29, Mir Baqi, a commander of the Mughal king Babur, razed the temple and built a mosque at the sacred site. So steadfast were the beliefs of the local Hindus that historical eye-witness accounts show that even after the destruction of the temple, Hindus continued to worship at the Janmasthan, or birth-spot.\n\nIn 1853, members of the Nirmohi Akhara occupied the site and claimed ownership of the structure. Frequent outbreak of clashes between the communities over this issue eventually led to division of the structure by the British administration for use by Hindus and Muslims in 1855. In 1883, the Hindus took the issue to the courts. The issue continued in the courts of British India as well as Independent India. Finally, on November 9th 2019, the Supreme Court of India in a unanimous judgement awarded the entire disputed land to the Hindu community and thus ended a relentless, nearly 500 year long struggle to reclaim the holy birth-site of Shree Ram.\n\nThe culmination of this struggle is a moment of great joy indeed. We celebrate Diwali/Deepavali on the day that Ram returned to Ayodhya after his vanvaas and victory over Ravana to free Sita maata. In the realm of mortals, this is another homecoming for Ram and certainly, every Bharatiya will have their hearts filled with the festive spirit of Diwali.

      <li>Title::: 'On the eve of Ram Mandir, I was wondering why Ram left Ayodhya even though it would benefit the people if he was the king. Then I read this on Quora, is this correct?'<br />Body: "&gt; Why does Rama follow his father's order to go to Vanvas for 14 years?\n\nFirst, it was NOT HIS FATHER’S ORDER that he goes to exile!\n\nBut for all intensive purpose to answer what I think you meant to ask - why did Sri Rama go to exile at all - my answer is this: I think it is for a reason that I bet you did not come across before. I will state the most prevalent reason followed by the correct reason imho per Valmiki Ramayana:\n\nMost prevalent reason: To ensure that his father remains truthful. As Kaikeyi asked for her two boons of his father, to coronate Bharata instead of Sri Rama as the crown prince and to send Sri Rama away to forests for exile for 14 years (why 14? why not 1 year or 5 years etc.? because the ancient law was that if you are absent from your property for 12 years, then the squatter gets full ownership of it, whether it is a house or a kingdom. So she asked for 12 + 2 more years just in case), and his father grudgingly held his tongue and did not verbally explicitly agree to them, Sri Rama understood that he has to do the bidding of Kaikeyi so that his father in his exceedingly old age (Dasharata was almost 60,000 years old at that time) does not attain the tag of a liar/promise-breaker.\n\nThis does not hold though. Because of couple reasons:\n\na. later on when his charioteer is driving Sri Rama &amp; Sira &amp; Lakshmana away to the forest, Dasharata runs after the chariot shouting it to stop and falls down shouting it to stop. Before the charioteer could act, Sri Rama orders him to keep driving and not stop. When charioteer asks what he should tell Dasharata after returning from dropping them in forest when questioned why he did not stop when ordered to do so, Sri Rama tells him to lie that he couldn’t hear it in the sound of the fast riding chariot wheels on the mud road. An ordinary man may compel another human to be a liar while wanting to keep his own father to be truthful, but not Sri Rama.\n\nb. Secondly, as an eldest son, he had no empathy for his own father who was running after the chariot shouting and crying for the chariot to stop? how can his ‘understood’ immediate duty of getting himself exiled to keep his father’s promise to his step mother so overcome any empathy from even stopping to console his screaming &amp; crying father before continuing along to his forest exile? After all he was known as the ‘maryAda purushOttam’…so how could he discard empathy and sympathy aside &amp; cold-heartedly do this?\n\nc. Finally, as a to be crowned prince and king-in-waiting awaiting confirmation, why did he decide to exile himself upon just the words from his step mother alone? The emperor his father never opened his mouth &amp; ordered him to go to exile or to forest at all! Why then did he quickly, without losing any time at all packed up and left for exile as quickly and as fast as he can? I think the below fact answers this conundrum:\n\nThe correct reason imho: When Dasharata takes Kaikeyi’s hand in marriage from her father, her father the emperor kAmbhoja (yes, the same Persian kamboja aka greek Cambyses line of ancient Iranian emperors) puts forth a condition that the son born out of Kaikeyi must inherit Dasharata’s empire which Dasharata agrees to and then marries Kaikeyi. The only two people who remembered it at the time Dasharata decided to coronate Sri Rama the night before, was Dasharata &amp; Sri Rama only - Kaikeyi loved Sri Rama so much that she completely forgot about it. She remembered it only after Manthra influenced her to ask for the two boons. This is why Dasharata hastened the night before to coronate Sri Rama quickly without giving any information to his in-laws or other tributary kingdoms. Well, Dasharata’s plan backfired, but Sri Rama who knew of this prior arrangement did not forget it and every action of his thereafter was fully influenced by it.\n\nThat is why Sri Rama, who even a rAkshasa touted as a dharma-Atma, and was known to his people as the righteous, acted the way he did so as to make the promise his father made to another emperor before his own birth true and satiate his step mother Kaikeyi’s wishes at the same time.\n\nSri Rama tells Lakshmana this very fact after Sita dozed off to sleep during their first night in the forest exile under the tree they choose to sleep. He also chides his father, the emperor, for having his lust for younger women &amp; warns why one should not allow his lust to overcome his allegiance to dharmic duty.\n\nThat is why he never even waited for the emperor to actually ask him to go to exile, he simply left because he know that the empire was never his to begin with until and after Kaikeyi’s son ruled it! That is why he could tell Sumatra, the charioteer to lie to his emperor so as to ensure that dharma remains upheld, not the wishes &amp; wants of the emperor or Sri Rama or Kausalya or Sumitra or Kaikeyi or Bharata or Manthara etc. And that is why he could not afford to empathize with the emperor as the emperor ran after his chariot crying and screaming for it to stop and not go to the exile, as being a dharma-Atma his allegiance is to uphold dharma alone!\n\nWhether it was when he lived in his kingdom, or when he married Sita or when he left for the exile or when he decided to befriend Sugriva vs. vAli or when he decided to kill vAli or why he gave away Lanka kingdom to vibhEshana even before he defeated its current king, or when he refused to enter Lanka upon invitation from vibhEshana after defeating Lanka’s king, or whenever he acted with Sita the way he did, Sri Rama’s sole allegiance was to dharma and upholding the dharma alone! That is why there was no other like him before he was born, and none like him (save Sri Krishna) ever since! And his leaving for exile has to do everything with his undeterred allegiance to dhamra alone as explained above."<br />Author: 'pleaaseeeno92'  id: 'i3o80i'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i3o80i/on_the_eve_of_ram_mandir_i_was_wondering_why_ram/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Fruit of hard work of my last 2 year's struggle"<br />Body: 'Hello friends,\nMy name is Abhishek Thapliyal and I have been working on a part-game-part-app for mobile since last 2 years. I wanted to create something huge, something which will cater to demands of the majority, something which will have a very, very high retention rate, something which will impress everyone. So I came up with an arcade which is a combination of 222 games and apps. I have designed the overall concept in such a way that it will easily satisfy the demand of the majority. Want to enjoy hyper-casual games? Want to exercise your brain with a tough game of Sudoku? Want to boost up your English vocabulary? Want to polish your knowledge skills? Wanna test your craft skills? You are most welcome.\n\nAll apps and games are divided into 7 categories:-\n\n1.)Single Arcade\nIn this section, you will get 100 hyper-casual games to enjoy !!!\n\n2.)Dual-Arcade\nIn this section,you will get 50 dual-player games to enjoy with your rival\n\n3.)Mission Arcade\nIn this section, you will get 5 games with total 300 levels to enjoy !!! From making logos to solving graphical puzzles, from blasting out enemy spacecrafts to destroying things, it covers everything\n\nThe difference between mission_arcade and single_arcade is that games in single_arcade are hyper-casual, there are no levels to complete. Just simply play them whenever you want.\nBut here you have to complete levels to move ahead, means that you can’t play a level until you have not cleared its previous level.\n\n4.)Puzzle Arcade\nIn this section you will get 50 puzzles to solve and enjoy. Sudoku, skyscraper, binox, jigoku, creek, kakuro, fillodoku, degree, ebony-ivory, futoshiki, go-figure, gokigen naname, hitori, kakurasu, kuromasu, nanogram etc are just few of the examples. There are also 4 types of puzzle-mazes\n(Remember, when a puzzle is solved, the ‘solve’ button disappears during the game-play)\n\nNOTE:- Very soon, I will introduce ‘save mechanism’. Through this feature, one will be able to save the work so that one can continue solving the puzzle where it was left earlier. It will be much comfortable to solve the puzzles\n\nIn most of the puzzles the background is black in color. It is because a good amount of time is required to solve puzzles, especially tough ones. It will reduce eye-fatigue as much as possible\n\n5.)Photo Arcade\nIn this section there are 5 photo-puzzles to solve and enjoy. Basically you have to jumble up the photos pieces to complete the level.\nThe unique thing about this is that all levels are already unlocked. Means that you can play any level you want in the beginning itself !!!\n\n6.)English_Mania\nIn this section there are 5 English related apps to enjoy. These are designed to improve your vocabulary and spelling and it also boost your knowledge. So jump in and enjoy all the benefits !!! You will never get something like this anywhere else\n\n7.)Extras\nIn this section there are 7 apps of various kinds, ranging from knowledge to art to memory and even more !!! Just imagine, drawing by tilting your mobile, making a 3-d object by painting boxes and a Pandora of knowledge and quotes !!! And even much more\n\n\nI have made 2 versions of my game. One is free (with ads) and another one is paid (you will have to pay only once).Naturally I will suggest to go with the free one (if you find the game cool then you are most welcome to purchase my game).\n\nFree version\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cascade.thaplisupergamefree\n\nPaid version\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cascade.thaplisupergame'<br />Author: 'Abhishek_Thapliyal_'  id: 'i3l47w'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i3l47w/fruit_of_hard_work_of_my_last_2_years_struggle/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'About the EIA 2020'<br />Body: 'Post the Bhopal gas leak tragedy, the government realized the need for stronger environmental laws in order to assess the impact of industrial and infrastructure projects on our natural resources and thus the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) norms were rolled out in 1994. Under these rules, it became mandatory to seek Environmental Clearance (EC) prior to the expansion or setting up of new industrial or modernization projects like mining, thermal power plants, river valley, infrastructure (road, highway, ports, harbours and airports) etc. \n\nEarlier in March 2020, when the country was in lockdown, the GoI proposed a new draft for EIA to make the process more "transparent and expedient".\n\nActivists, especially those based in TN, contend that this draft is nothing but a rehashing of the TSR committee report on overhauling environmental laws, which was roundly rejected by the Parliamentary Standing Committee back in 2015 on the grounds that ["it would result in an unacceptable dilution of the existing legal and policy architecture established to protect our environment"](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/parliamentary-standing-committee-rejects-tsr-subramanian-report-on-environmental-laws-50577). You would also remember this as the time when that IB report "leaked" about how foreign-funded NGOs in India like Greenpeace etc are "a threat to national security and development".\n\nCut to July 2020, when Greta Thungberg\'s NGO decided to make a coordinated effort to send mails to the Environment Ministry raising concerns about the EIA draft, they were first booked under the UAPA, which was later deemed to be a "clerical" error and then further booked under the IT Act for "sending too many emails". [Their website is still blocked](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/uapa-charge-in-notice-to-environmental-group-fridays-for-future-due-to-clerical-error-delhi-police-1703716-2020-07-23)\n\nComing to the draft itself, listed below are the most controversial proposed changes -\n\n1. Post-facto clearance - Remember that Vizag gas leak tragedy in May? [That chemical plant was running without an EC for many years](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/vizag-gas-tragedy-lg-polymers-lacked-environmental-clearance-before-chemical-gas-leak-616707) Under this new change, if LG Polymers had simply sought clearance or paid a fine before the disaster occurred, it would\'ve been a-okay. Oh and funny thing, [in an order on April 1, the Supreme Court held “ex post facto environmental clearances” contrary to law](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/sc-sets-aside-ngts-directions-regarding-ex-post-facto-environmental-clearance) but still the govt persists.\n\n2. Suo moto declaration of violation - There are two ways in which flouting of environmental laws can be punished - either the govt catches you red-handed or you self-report and pay a fine. The public can no longer report such rule-breaking. \n\n3. Strategic exemptions - In the list of projects that will not be up for a public consultation, there\'s a new and arbitrary category called "strategic projects" as decided by the Central Govt. Also, border area projects will be exempt too, where "border area" is defined as \'area falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from the LAC with bordering countries of India." So most of the Northeast, the repository of the country’s richest biodiversity.\n\n4. Response times shortened while clearance validity extended - In a double whammy, the public only gets 20 days (from the previous 30) to peruse a proposed project plan and make objections or suggestions, if any. OTOH, most projects now enjoy a greater validity for their existing ECs, for ex - a mining company\'s EC validity has been extended 30 to 50 years while nuclear power plants have been bumped to 15 years from the previous 5. Companies also now only have to furnish environmental compliance reports annually instead of bi-annually. \n\nIn an attempt to scupper public discussion about all this, [Prakash Javadedkar went against his own ministry\'s proposal to extend public hearing period by 60 days and set the deadline for 30 June.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/environment-impact-assessment-draft-prakash-javadekar-deadline-extension-lockdown-6476451/)Thankfully, [the Delhi HC stepped in ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/draft-environment-impact-assessment-norms-explained-6482324/) and the new deadline is August 11.\n\nI recommend that we all do our bit by sending an email to the ministry by following the instructions [here](https://letmebreathe.in/2020/06/27/sample-letter-to-the-environment-ministry-on-draft-eia-notification-2020/)  because honestly this reads more like a draft for Make In India than for environmental protection.\n\nAlso there is no **planet B** now is there ?'<br />Author: 'Aerowisca'  id: 'i3iorg'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i3iorg/about_the_eia_2020/</li>

A bit of a backdrop first.I study in a government medical college in India(acronym-GDMC).\n\nA co-student made a meme page on Instagram with the name of our college in it.Couple of things there are quite funny but nothing too serious,that is until today.\nOn the occasion of Raksha Bandhan,he posted a picture of a scene from a popular Tv series portraying incest.And the caption-Happy Raksha Bandhan.\n\nAs you could expect,the comment section exploded. The admin of the page kept deleting comments and still is doing the same. In the Hindu religion,the brother sister relationship is viewed as something pure,serene and highly respected. And it\'s far from incest.\n\nNext,a lot of people confronted him. Rather just deleting the post which was offensive to so many people,he seemed indifferent. His view of all this ruckus was he doesn\'t care if someone gets offended by his senseless post on a social media.\nAnd he\'s supposedly defending his actions by saying Incest is not illegal in India and he can joke about it if he wants.\n\nNot to mention this guy will be becoming a Doctor in a couple of years and will be responsible for treating patients of all castes,creed and religion. His final comment to everyone arguing he remove this ?\n"It\'s my meme page and I can do whatever I want with it. If you get offended by it,you can unfollow."\n\nNow here\'s where I need the help of you guys. A lot of people have tried reporting the post but still it hasn\'t been removed(the last time I checked Instagram\'s policy doesn\'t allow posts of such kind which defame a particular religion).If you could help us out,it would be great.But that\'s not it.\n\nHe\'s been bragging about it\'s his page.That means the responsibility for all its content is solely his.And with this in mind,we are planning for legal recourse against him for:\n\n1) Posting content that is demeaning to others and hurts their religious sentiments.IPC Section 295A.\n\n2) Falsely attempting to use the name of the college which is associated with the State Government when he\'s not authorised to do so.\n\nI am not really into the field of Law and Justice but such an action needs to be properly accounted for. Also there\'s a need for an example to be set so that in future no person makes such derogatory posts on social media in the name of a govt authority.'<br />Author: 'OkEffect3'  id: 'i36ubp'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i36ubp/happy_raksha_bandhan_to_all_help_needed/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The left is right - "What about Kashmiri Pandits" is a stupid thing to constantly ask'<br />Body: 'It\'s high time people stopped asking this question. Kashmiri Pandits were collectively failed by everyone across the board, across party lines, across institutions like judiciary, media, etc. Their fate was hushed up and justice for their families sacrificed at the altar of India\'s faux seculairsm. \n\nThe Kashmiri Pandit community has not agitated for much - not because they didn\'t suffer, but because no one lent them a voice, a platform. They struggled and today are living across India and the world, well assimilated and their trauma finally known to the world. In a way, the cause of Kashmiri Pandits is a shut case. We failed them and it\'s over. Rehabilitation is not an option when no one would want to move back to an unsafe environment. Too late for any kind of monetary/material help. It would be meaningless. Some kind of symbolic recognition of what happened to them maybe in order. A resolution of parliament, perhaps. \n\nBut that is not the main point of my post. Have you ever heard anyone ask, "What about the Jews in 1930s Germany?". No. It\'s about the Nazis and Hitler. Why do we Indians focus on the victims? When we should really be drawing attention to the perpetrators. Why don\'t the names of Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Yasin Malik draw the same disgust from people as the names of Hitler or Goebbels. Most Indians don\'t even know about them and their barbaric deeds. Yes, partly because of the media, but also because the people who are sensitive to this issue simply use the wrong language. Because the right suffers from a lack of articulation and is reactionary. \n\nWe should take this destruction of faux secularism to the logical end. Time to start asking - what about Islamic extremism and Kaffir-hate? Remember Syed Shah Geelani. Remember JKLF. "Ethnic cleansing doesn\'t start with threats from mosque loudspeakers and targeted killings, it starts with fear-mongering about Hindu majoritarianism and looking down on other religions." And high time the bullshit "Pandits took all jobs" narrative is crushed. So let\'s start asking the right questions and raising the right issues more prominently. It is focusing on the victims that allow the true nature and intentions of the perpetrators be hidden.'<br />Author: '1984_is_overrated_af'  id: 'i31ijf'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i31ijf/the_left_is_right_what_about_kashmiri_pandits_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Venereal Disease and the Prostitution Policy of the British Raj: brothels established and run out of military cantonments by the British; trafficking and abuse of women; more details in link at the end of this brief summary'<br />Body: 'In 19th century India, venereal disease was a huge problem among British troops. the average annual admission of British troops to hospitals for venereal infections, predominantly syphilis and gonorrhoea, was over 200 per 1000; by 1895 this reached a whopping rate of over 500 per 1000. \nA viceroy writing to the secretary of state for India, acknowledged that “the strength of the British Army in India as a fighting machine has been much impaired by these diseases”.\n\nThe likely explanation for this was that majority of British soldiers sought prostitutes, a frequent source of infection. \n\namong Indian soldiers, the reported incidence of venereal disease was much lower; in 1866, for example, the rates of infection for British and Indian troops were 218 and 54 per 1000 respectively. \n\nIndigenous Indian troops consistently demonstrated far lower rates of venereal admission than the Europeans, and their “immunity” was a cause of some resentment. \n\nIt was suggested that native troops slyly concealed their condition or resorted to “quacks” for indigenous remedies, or that they had possibly become partially immune through frequent exposure \n\nNobody would entertain the idea that Indian soldiers might just be less sexually promiscuous than the British. \n\nTheir assumption was that diseases caught in the tropics were “more ravaging” than those acquired in the “gentler” climates of Europe, affecting the “refined white constitution” with greater severity, and that all native Indian women were “infected”. \n\nMilitary authorities had long accepted that an outlet for their soldiers’ sexual energy was essential. \nThe provision of women—registered, inspected, and available—was seen as a method of exercising medical and disciplinary control over their troops was far preferred over the alternative – increase in masturbation, seeking prostitutes who were potential sources of infection, or homosexuality, which was particularly dreaded. \n\nThe imposition of section 377 starting in 1860 that punished sodomy, buggery, and bestiality as offenses wasn’t enough. The threat of homosexuality, not only as a vice but also as potential damage to the reputation of the empire - was cited to justify the making available of prostitutes to the armed forces. \n\nBritish authorities conspired at setting up a system of licensed brothels and issuing license cards for “approved” prostitutes. \n\nThe Cantonments Act of 1864 and the Indian Contagious Diseases Act of 1868 jointly organized the sex trade within military cantonments and enabled supervision, registration, and inspection of prostitute women in major Indian cities and seaports.\n\nIndian prostitutes were segregated in specially designated enclosures called ‘chaklas’ (brothels) within the cantonments, where there was also a lock hospital. \n\nAround 12-15 native women were assigned to regiments of about a thousand soldiers\n\nA number of women of all castes were often pressured to leave their homes or abandoned or abducted, only to be sold to the cantonment magistrates and forced to move into these chaklas.\n\nOutside of the cantonment and traditionally in Indian society, prostitutes were not treated as “outcastes”, rather, they enjoyed a social status, unlike prostitutes in Britain\n\nthe women were obliged to undergogo a periodic (once a week or fortnightly) genital examination, often with a vaginal speculum, and an inexperienced physician using it\n\nRegistered prostitutes in chaklas were called ‘Lal Kurti’ or “queen’s ladies”, and areas of regimental brothels were known as “lal-bazaars”. The chaklas were supervised by superintendents or brothel-keepers/madams called ‘mahaldarnis’, who were official permits were granted to these women go out to procure more women as and when needed. The price of the visits of soldiers to the chakla was fixed by the military at such a low rate that a given soldier would scarcely pass up the opportunity.\n\nNative men were not allowed near the chakla and an armed guard was present at all times - brothers and husbands who might be bent upon rescuing their female family members.\n\nMany cruelties were inflicted upon the women kept in these cantonment brothels by the British. They were often physically abused by soldiers, subjected to cruelties in their drunken states, and at times, even murdered. \n\nWomen were imprisoned in ‘Lock Hospitals’ for several days each month, even when in perfect health; imprisoned for indefinite periods of time if found diseased; expelled if seriously diseased, with their half-British children, to starve, or to spread disease among the natives; and finally, dismissed to starvation when too old to be “sufficiently attractive” to the soldier, if only a fresh victim could be found to take their place;  impoverished and receiving a pittance fixed by the military, that kept many of them on the verge of starvation. \n\n\nEfforts to teach the soldiers self-control had already failed miserably, as evidenced by the “Report of the Army Health Association”, printed at Meerut, in 1892. \n\nThe brown Indian prostitute, subservient to the British male, was a paradigm of racial superiority - a critical component to the assertion of European power.\n\nIn this regard, the presence of few European prostitutes in India was unnerving, and a matter of considerable political gravity to the British; the symbolic servitude of a white woman to the brown man would radically and fatally undermine the basis of colonial rule. \nThe European women were tolerated in the hope that British troops would preferred engaging with them instead of with native Indian women.\nThe raj had to come to terms with the dismaying possibility that some of these white women might have sex with Indian men – an idea that seemed abhorrent to them.  Colonial ideas of sexuality were clearly mapped along racial lines – through prostitution by white women was destabilizing to established colonial supremacy, they always occupied a higher regard than their native counterparts.\n\nTo prevent the natives from buying the services of European women, the Indian Contagious Diseases Act instituted two classes of brothels occupied by native women: the first class comprised of those reserved for British men and a second class of those reserved for indigenous men. \n\nAn Indian woman could be arrested on suspicion of solicitation even if she was simply walking down the street, if in case she was unregistered and didn’t carry a “card”. She would then be harassed, brought before the Cantonment magistrate, and forced to register as a prostitute and live among the soldiers. Police would often take large bribes, threatening women of this fate. \n\n\nIndian attitudes and tolerance towards prostitution, trafficking of women and girls, and segregated brothels seem to reach a crescendo during the 1910s. Violence against women was increasing - women facing domestic violence who deserted their husbands found themselves trapped in Kolkata’s brothels. Two cases that drew particular public attention and exposed the horrors of the brothel system happened in 1918. One was of a young girl of 14 abducted from a festival and forced into prostitution, and the other was of a corrupt Inspector General that offer protection to a brothel that regularly abducted young girls. Brothels began to be associated with multiple criminal activities such as sodomy, trafficking, and the scandalous sexualization of Indian society, while doing absolutely nothing by way of control of venereal diseases. \n\nWhatever be the case with respect to the incidence of venereal disease, the British used the “health of their troops” as a justification for the imposition of western ideas of commercialization of sex and the vile debasement of respectable women, and imposition of sexual control as a central plank of imperial policy. \n\n\nTouting their misplaced sense of “western morality”, and contrasting themselves from the native “savages” – a policy by which the revered “Devadasi women” of temples were criminalized and outlawed, after classifying them as complicit in an “illegitimate form of prostitution”. \n\nAccording to the British, there was no distinction between the indigenous courtesan tradition and the British System of commercial prostitution.  \n\nThe fact that prostitutes were “accepted” in Indian society somehow proved the inferiority of Indian morals, in their view. Their monolithic view of Indian culture and a complete lack of understanding of Indian society led to the imposition of policies that were incompatible and incongruent with the Indian ethos. \n\nImperialist Britain’s rigid views of morality, rooted in Christian orthodoxy, being superimposed onto a diverse and free Indian society, coupled with the fact that the military occupied a central role in the expansionist agenda of the empire, resulted in their engaging in one of the largest scale human trafficking operations in modern history. \n\nPolice would often take large bribes, threatening women of this fate. \n\nIndian attitudes and tolerance towards prostitution, trafficking of women and girls, and segregated brothels seem to reach a crescendo during the 1910s.

Have never thought, that Turkey will pull-out such a devilish rabbit out of their hat towards India.'\n\nBefore few days, I just randomnly came across a news that Turkey President have turned a church into mosque after several years and made everyone to call it 'Historic'! Now I'm getting the clear picture of it ! He doesn't want to turn it as 'Mosque' for good-sake but only to project him as an 'Islamic Leader' towards the rest of the World including the Islamic people in it.\n\nI tell you, one who funds for terrorism in other National and wants to bring other country down through TERRORISM must be really sick inside his head.

The reason behind Turkey Erdogan's move about radicalism in India rised once when our ties with UAE grown up. The bilateral ties between India-Turkey is wellknown by the world and that wasn't tolerated by Erdogan.\n\nAnother shocking fact is that, Turkish Govt have funded Separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Kashmir to disturb our peace already. And also, the fact about funding Rs.40 lakh to radical Islam in Kerala is beyond imagination. It is highly evident that, Erdogan will not stop with this and we must be aware of this.

      <li>Title::: 'Dairy industry is as cruel as meat industry if not more, still no Hindus oppose it, why?'<br />Body: 'Almost all Hindus oppose cow slaughter, because cow in Hinduism is considered very holy, and you obviously don\'t want to hurt it. \n\nMost cows are tied to a pole by 1.5-2 meter ropes  whole day. They eat, piss, shit, sleep and get milked in same spot. Whole day standing in same 2 meter circle in your own piss, shit and food getting beaten if master is having a bad day, cows are impregnated as many times as possible, you think cows like it? Do they enjoy living in these conditions? Once in a while some people worship, post your pictures on social media and say how much they respect you, kill people because they try to harm you (oh the irony). Does any of this "respect" matter? \n\nSome might argue that if Hindus quit consuming dairy then millions will lose their source of income, we can\'t let millions of humans suffer because of cows and that might  be a valid point.\n\nBut what happens after a cow stops producing milk, no middle-class farmer can afford to take care spent cows. If we force farmers to take care of spent cows till their natural death then most farmers will quit dairy.\n\nSo Indian farmers have two options of disposal of their spent cows, either sell them to butcher or abandon them. Later option might seem more humane to many as it doesn\'t involve direct death, if you sell it to butcher it\'ll have a relatively quick death within days, but if you abandon it\'ll live for another few if lucky. \n\nBut is the life of abandoned cows worth living? A quick death is much more better option then that miserable life of abandoned cows. Abandoned cows eat human food out of garbage, drink very polluted water, chew on plastic, get beaten, have accidents with vehicles, have dozens of diseases, they injure or even kill kids and older people if scared, die a slow painful death on roadside, their bodies rot for days.\n\nMeat industry doesn\'t hurt cows nearly as much dairy industry does, still no Hindus oppose dairy industry, only meat industry? If Hindus care about cows so much can\'t they give up dairy products and raise voice against the cruel industry? Why is the most sacred animal in India treated so cruelty and no one is raising voice against it?'<br />Author: 'Stranger3800'  id: 'i2esda'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i2esda/dairy_industry_is_as_cruel_as_meat_industry_if/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Appeal to Indian Americans'<br />Body: 'I live in the US and am fortunate enough to still have a job that pays the same salary. Due to the economic impact wreaked by Covid in India, I sent some money to India based charities (a little over 10k $. My logic was simple. I am getting my regular salary and because I am staying home, I am saving quite a bit of money - no gas/petrol, no outside lunches, movies, etc. I used to fly to my work location and now I don\'t need to - that means I am saving on lodging and boarding expenses too. Fortunately or unfortunately I didn\'t get any stimulus money since I don\'t qualify.   \n\n\nAnyway, I reached out to a few of my friends and asked them if they can help a few of the charities that are focusing on donating groceries, etc. Almost all of them gave some or the other excuses. Some of these folks are really close - I know them for over 25 years so I took the liberty of challenging them that when they are saving more money this year than last year, why not share some of it with the less privileged. Especially when the government in the US is giving them free money. Almost all of them already told me they got 2900 or 3400 $ depending on the size of the family. \n\nThe excuses they gave me made me sad. One said, he lost half a million in stocks during the down turn (which he recovered to his own admission after the market bounced back) so his charity has no relationship with his spend or gains (my take away is, he won\'t do any charity no matter what money he makes). Another guy gave me a sad story of his family had to come back to the US and paid a lot of money to buy tickets. Something he would\'ve done even if he didn\'t get the stimulus money. \n\n  \nAfter speaking to four such friends, who are otherwise really good guys, I realized a few things.\n\n1. We, as a culture, are really shiity people when it comes to helping others. We save and save and are dedicated to passing on our wealth to our children who will do the same. Unfortunately, our  kids don\'t give a shit for the wealth we pass on (just as I don\'t give a shit for the wealth my dad will pass on).\n2. We have no realization of how privileged we are. We are fucking tone deaf to the plight of those underprivileged. We feel we are this "great people" who deserved everything we have - forgetting that we rode a wave or won genetic lottery (in addition to our hard work). Not every hard work results in success - sometimes being able to appreciate what we have and having sympathy for those with less seems like a simple thing but I guess it is not.  \n\n\nIf any of you are living in the US and reading this, please send some money to India based charities. If you don\'t know any, send to Akshya Patra. They are helping families during COVID and during other times, they feed school children.  If you work for any decent company, submit a donation match request so that the charity gets an equal amount of contribution from your company. Help people in India. We all came from there. The education system didn\'t break our parents\' backs or our backs (like it is here). We have a very privileged life so sharing a tiny bit with less fortunate shouldn\'t be a difficult concept. If possible, make your children part of your charity activities. Their respect for you goes up while their chances of becoming better people increases. Do it for your country. Do it for yourself. Jai Hind.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Appeal for Indian Americans - please help charities from India.

      <li>Title::: 'Is Hinduism is primarily a reactionary political movement, not an authentic religion?'<br />Body: 'Hinduism arose out of the need to present a unified culture to go head-to-head against the presence of European Christians in the Indian sub-continent. In fact, most of the Hindu cults in India have been directly influenced by Christianity, and were it not for that Christian influence these cults would have long ago been assimilated into either Buddhism or drifted into obscurity when the lower castes at last got sick and tired of Brahmanic abuses.\n\nLook at Narendra Modi today, he has carefully sculpted Hinduism into a national religion when nothing could be farther from the truth. Hinduism is paganism, it is the worship of each individual person\'s "ideal" in the form of an *idol.* Advaita, the philosophical school which arose from pagan India, defined this idol-consciousness as *ishvara.*\n\nThere is a lot of talk about unity in Hinduism but the Hindu cults only are able to unite over their common Indian heritage; this is why racism and Hinduism go hand in hand. It is also why the Hindu cults which have been influenced by Christianity are so frowned upon by the "big name" Brahmins who work in temples and pride themselves on their Vedic gymnastics. Vice versa, it is why the other sects try to become Brahminical themselves, so as not to feel excluded from a "wider faith family" which is presented in "Hinduism."\n\nThe Caitanyite cult is obviously the most contemporary example of Christian influence upon pagan India. Whether Caitanya himself ever interacted with Christian missionaries is conspicuously left out of any of his many biographies, or "gospels" as they are called today. Certainly, he interacted with the heresy of Islam, as evidenced by one of his close disciples converting from that religion. This is a dubious claim itself, considering the penalty for apostasy in Islam. Nonetheless, not soon after Portuguese ships began converting the pagan population of India do we see a cultural [backlash.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuncolim_revolt)\n\nIf the Caitanyite biographies really stem from the individual himself or if they were superimposed at a later date is arguable. Clearly they show some influence by Christianity with an emphasis on love, forgiveness, a unifying monotheistic concept, especially on the Name of God (a practice popular around the same time in Christian [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christogram#IHS)), and Caitanya\'s own obsession with the *written word*.\n\nWhatever the origins of Caitanya\'s hodgepodge repackaging of the expiring Vedic religion, the fact remains it all but disappeared for several hundred years until the cultural climate once again necessitated the unifying ethos of a religio-cultural movement. The Brahmins had squirreled away their Caitanyite scripts for a later date, presumably to justify their own status by being descended from some famous disciple or not. Their pujas and temple fees went on for ages unbothered by the Christian principles tucked away in Caitanya\'s movement.\n\nBut the common populace seemed to possess a hereditary memory of the anti-varna, egalitarian vision presented by Caitanya, and it bubbled up in Kedarnath Datta and Bhimla Prasad, individuals who were more learned in the Western school of thought than many of their obstinate Brahminical associates. At this same moment of cultural turmoil, many cults were forming as a response to European colonization. You have the drugged out friends of Gaddadar Chattopadhyaya, the reluctant Brahmin of a Sonthal idol, all of whom partied with Brahmo Samaj; you have the followers of Ghanshyam Pande who were built on military influence and fanaticism nearly a century before; the list goes on and on and on. Cults, cult-leaders, and a whole lot of turmoil.\n\nSo the Vishnu cult did a number on all of them and decided to send their "lost Caitanyite gospel" out to the Western world--a sort of tit-for-tat. Of course, having both been educated in Christian colleges, Kedarnath and Bhimla Prasad could have accepted Christianity, but they stubbornly refused, too caught up in the cultural mileu of their day.\n\nThey did, however, borrow from their knowledge of Christianity when establishing their cult. Particularly the structure of the Church, with Her bishops and priests, missionaries and dogmas, and most importantly: the concept of Apostolic succession! How much they knew of the Roman Catholic Church I\'m unsure, but certainly their interaction with the English was enough.\n\nThey devised a system of "guru succession" which allowed them to trace their Brahminical spirit not by flesh and blood but through spiritual inauguration, in a devilish imitation of the Catholic Papacy, which has true Apostolic succession from Jesus Christ through St. Peter.\n\nTheir heretical idea of guru-tatwa really caught on, as evidenced by the countless number of cults today which have splintered off from their midst. The number of Hindu cults probably almost matches the number of Christian cults that have arisen out of Luther\'s Reformation.\n\nIf Hinduism hadn\'t constantly been repackaged and redesigned, it would be what it always has been and always will be: superstition.

How will we form new opinions if not with discussion?\n\nThe issue is not only about creating a space for discussion. There should be a central subreddit for India related discussion. For example, Covid has affected people from both these subreddits equally. There are great resources shared by people in the threads which one half of us will not see. Then there are non-political posts. I just don't understand the divide.\n\nBoth subreddits are to be blamed in my opinion. I have a suggestion to start with. Let's have some automatic cross posts between these two subreddits. Maybe we can start with sharing top 10 weekly non-political posts. What do you guys say? Let's discuss on this.\n\n(Cross posting this on &lt;redacted&gt;. Will add link to the cross post in a comment)\n\nP.S. I can't believe the original post which had mention of the subreddit name was deleted by moderators. Maybe there has been already a lot of discussion on this in past and that is why moderators want to prevent this meta drama. But I haven't seen discussion on this ever. Let's please talk.

      <li>Title::: "This is a quote from Ambedkar's treatise on Pakistan. Enjoy."<br />Body: '" the Hindu was taxed to the extent of half the produce of his land, and had to pay duties on all his buffaloes, goats,\n\nand other milk-cattle. The taxes were to be levied equally on rich and poor, at so much per acre, so much per\n\nanimal. Any collectors or officers taking bribes were summarily dismissed and heavily punished with sticks,\n\npincers, the rack, imprisonment and chains. The new rules were strictly carried out, so that one revenue officer\n\nwould string together 20 Hindu notables and enforce payment by blows. No gold or silver, not even the betelnut, so\n\ncheering and stimulative to pleasure, was to be seen in a Hindu house, and the wives of the impoverished native\n\nofficials were reduced to taking service in Muslim families. Revenue officers came to be regarded as more deadly\n\nthan the plague; and to be a government clerk was disgrace worse than death, in so much that no Hindu would\n\nmarry his daughter to such a man. "\n\nThese edicts, says the historian of the period,\n\n" were so strictly carried out that the chaukidars and khuts and muqad-dims were not able to ride on horseback, to\n\nfind weapon, to wear fine clothes, or to indulge in betel. . .... No Hindu could hold up his head. ..... Blows,\n\nconfinement in the stocks, imprisonment and chains were all employed to enforce payment. "\n\nAll this was not the result of mere caprice or moral perversion. On the other hand, what was done was in\n\naccordance with the ruling ideas of the leaders of Islam in the broadest aspects. These ideas were well expressed by\n\nthe Kazi in reply to a question put by Sultan Ala-ud-Din wanting to know the legal position of the Hindus under\n\nMuslim law. The Kazi said :—\n\n" They are called payers of tribute, and when the revenue officer demands silver from them they should without\n\nquestion, and with all humility and respect, tender gold. If the officer throws dirt in their mouths, they must without\n\nreluctance open their mouths wide to receive it..... The due subordination of the Dhimmi is exhibited in this humble\n\npayment, and by this throwing of dirt into their mouths. The glorification of Islam is a duty, and contempt for\n\nreligion is vain. God holds them in contempt, for he says, \' Keep them in subjection \'. To keep the Hindus in\n\nabasement is especially a religious duty, because they are the most inveterate enemies of the Prophet, and because\n\nthe Prophet has commanded us to slay them, plunder them, and make them captive, saying, \' Convert them to Islam\n\nor kill them, and make them slaves, and spoil their wealth and properly \'. No doctor but the great doctor (Hani-fah),\n\nto whose school we belong, has assented to the imposition of jizya on Hindus ; doctors of other schools allow no\n\nother alternative but \' Death or Islam \'.

Since then, that is, since 5 August 2019, almost an year ago, the common citizens of Jammu and Kashmir have been living lives under detention, massive and unchecked military surveillance, and by an absolute curbing of the fundamental rights envisaged under the Constitution of India, including freedom of speech and expression, right to life and personal liberty, right to not be exploited, right to equality among many others.\n\nIt is that same piece of land that China intended to appropriate only weeks back, and valiant efforts of the armed forces of India were exhibited when more than 20 of our bravehearts died in a hand to hand combat.

The unfortunate incident happened when students of  Darivit High School in Islampur came face to face with the police force. \n\n&gt;The two ex-students were identified as Rajesh Sarkar and Tapas Barman. While Rajesh Sarkar died at the spot, Tapas Barman was shifted to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital with serious injuries. Later he succumbed to his injuries. Parents of the two deceased claim that they died in police firing. However, police and administration has ruled out such allegations. \n\n&gt;The students of this school situated in North Dinajpur district’s Islampur were agitating against the recruitment of two Urdu teachers, demanding teachers’ hiring for other subjects like English, Bengali, History and Science. Interestingly, Darivit High School is a Bengali-medium school with a strength of 1700 and had no students opting for Urdu language. Hence, the students were agitating since Monday demanding recruitment for other subjects like English, Bengali, History and Science. \n\n&gt;On Thursday afternoon, police escorted the two newly recruited Urdu teachers to the school campus and students prevented them from entering the school.  Immediately, the students clashed with the police. The students allegedly pelted stones at the police. In retaliation, the police reportedly fired tear gas shells and resorted to a lathi-charge. However, parents of these students and locals claim that police opened fire on the students. \n\n&gt;Several other students, four locals and three policemen suffered serious injuries.  “Policemen attacked us, there were no women constables on the campus.

      <li>Title::: 'HERD IMMUNITY! Is this the right way to go forward? GIVE IT A READ!!'<br />Body: "To begin herd immunity refers to development of immunity towards a disease after a large number of population is infected by it and developed antibodies. Basically if majority of population develops antibodies towards a virus spread of the virus stops. Hence attaining herd immunity. Historically this is done with vaccine and natural spread of virus to avoid fatality rate. But there is no vaccine right now.\n\nI have seen that many governments in the country have move towards herd immunity against covid-19. Some government made restriction strict to control the disease. Some have relaxed to the way where infection would spread fast, and they might attain herd immunity.(mostly in metro cities).\n\nHere i want to know from you people, is this herd immunity way the right way to go forward or not?\n\nHere is my opinion:\n\nPros of herd immunity (states and UT eg: delhi, Maharashtra and telengana)\n\n-increase in economic activity, (since the restrictions are equal to none. Mostly control on public gathering events other than that nothing.)\n\n-rate of infection slows down. since much of the population of the state will be infected and create antibodies. Meaning infection rate will be very low, hence the curve comes downward.\n\n-inflow of govt. Revenue, this is probably the main reason many governments have decided to go with herd immunity. It ia seen because of the lockdown the revenue of govt. Was completely stalled and it was becoming difficult for them to run the state.\n\n-income for lower class, OK this is not necessary directly depend on herd immunity but people who comes in lower income bracket. With economy open with least restrictions, work is available and they can get their daily wages.\n\n-damage control of the economy, with the damage already out country is going to face because of restrictions. Less restriction will result in less unemployment and less damge to the economy\n\n-less unemployment and less businesses wiping out. With no restrictions many business will survive this. And we might not go in economy depression, which would be devastating.\n\n\nCons of herd immunity (state and ut: rajesthan, madhya pradesh, kerela, UP these are the states who did not follow herd immunity, no major metro city in these states)\n\n-sky high fatality rate, going herd immunity without vaccination will lead to a large number of deaths. Which are seen in states with herd immunity try. One the big reason is because the curve is climbing high meaning no beds available, people not getting proper treatment because of the number of cases.\n\n-economic problem, hang on didn't i just said that least restrictions meaning more economy activities. Yes, but we are dealing with humas here not robots, what i mean to say is where ever there are rise in cases substantially there is pattern that people are staying home. They are avoiding going out unnecessary. Meaning they are contributing very less to the economy because of the scare. Many states like telengana have seen voluntary lockdown by market associations themselves because of the rising cases.\n\n-life saving gone, when a middle class person is is affected by the virus. They are losing their life saving on treatment because of the number of cases and demand for beds is more, resulting in absurd fees for the treatment. And many govt are also full. Imagine when they lose their life saving. How much would they be able to contribute the economy later on since they hardly have money to spend. And its all gone to the hospitals.\n\n-Income inequality gap increases, with people with losing such high volume of savings, hospitals are the one getting that money and the shareholders of the hospital becomes richer and middle class people lose savings.\n\n-families livelihood, there are many families in india where there is only one member of the family is earing. On this large scale of infection, the likelihood of the that member getting infected in the family is very high. Since he is the one that goes out to do the work. He might loans on his head to pay. If something happens to that person of the house who pays the loans what happens to the livelihood of the family?\n\n-no confirmation of antibodies longevity. I am aware abput serological survey in delhi and mumbai. But you should now that this survey was done in only highly affected areas only.\nOn the other hand spain has done a largest serological survey in spain with lancet. Keep in mind that spain was highly affected march. This report came in mid july. Where samples were collected from every corner of the country. The results were SHOCKING. They found only 6% of the population still had antibodies and many don't. Meaning they might have lost the immunity towards the virus. Meaning there are chances of reinfection. We are not sure for how long we would have the immunity towards it.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/07/06/health/spain-coronavirus-antibody-study-lancet-intl/index.html\n\nBefore doing research like everyone i thought its life or Economy, but after reading mit report on it and seeing Scandinavian countries examples i m sure thats not the case\n\nIts not either LIFE or ECONOMY. It can be both it nothing else . Sweden who tried a herd immunity where they did not implement any lockdown have seen marginal economy improvement than other Scandinavian countries who implemented lockdown, but very high fatality rate.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html\n\nMy opinion is that there cannot be a complete lockdown till vaccine arrive obviously. But there can be a partial lockdown. Where the restrictions are there and implemented properly.just like MP, UP, GUJ. Where there are proper restrictions to stop the spread and yet their economy is doing good. Its tha balance we should try to achieve.\n\n\n\nShare your opinion if i missed something and correct me if you think i m wrong."<br />Author: 'vijayagroya'  id: 'i0kbv8'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i0kbv8/herd_immunity_is_this_the_right_way_to_go_forward/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why Maoism needs to be opposed?'<br />Body: "This is in response to the article posted and arguments made by /u/ranon20 . I am posting this here for greater visibility considering the gravity of the Maoist situation.\r\n\r\nThe following was the article that was posted-\r\n\r\nhttps://theprint.in/opinion/indians-regret-silence-modi-political-prisoners/470594/\r\n\n\nI disagree completely with the article. It builds itself through an assumption that there is a Hindutva conspiracy behind the arrest of innocent activists. The even bigger problem is it rejects anything and everything by government as lies and unconditionally believes whatever the so called activists claim(on what basis). I don't have a problem with scepticism at all, infact this is a necessary element in a democracy. But selective scepticism always scream of ideological motivation which is apparent in the article.\n\nI will tackle three questions with regards to the article-\n\n1. Does Urban Naxal movement exists or is it a conspiracy by the far right?\n\n2. Are there any substance to the activist's alleged connection to the Naxal movement mentioned or is it again a conspiracy by the far right?\n\n3. Even if there are connection should be allow the Naxal intellectuals to operate because they are non-violent?\n\nFor the first question it needs to be tackled in two parts, first, does Naxal movement have a conscious strategy of penetrating urban intellectual circles and NGOs and second how successful have they been in this strategy. \n\nThere are two documents that support the allegation that Naxal movement has such a strategy you can find them [here](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/maoist/documents/papers/strategy.htm#13) and [here](https://usiofindia.org/publication/usi-journal/urban-perspective-plan-an-analysis-of-maoist-perspective-and-assessment/) (second one is an analysis of the said plan). This proves that not only they have a urban strategy but also outlines for what ends they are using it. They are using existing NGOs and new NGOs created by them for sabotaging the government and recruiting young educated people to lead their Maoist insurgency in remote parts of the country. It isn't surprising since most of their present leaders are educated city living elites like Ganapathy, Muppalla Laxman Rao, Kobad Ghandy, Anuradha Ghandy, Saketh Rajan, Sridhar Shriniwasan,\xa0 Ravi Sarma and B. Anuradha.\n\nNow how much success did they have with this strategy. In 2013, in the era of UPA 2 has identified [128 frontal organisation with Maoist links](http://-128-front-organizations-for-Naxals.html/). These organisations are active not only in Maoist infested states but also in states kike Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh where there is no Maoist related violence. We have worked hard to reduce Maoism from it's peak in 2011 of 180 districts to 30, this move into urban areas risks reigniting the Maoist Insurgency. Convicted Maoist GN Saibaba is an example about how deep have the Maoist penetrated our own establishment. \n\nComing to the second question is there any substance to the allegations. Now the article you posted believes the innocence of the activists blindly while treating Government with scepticism. Here is Pahad Singh, a Naxal leader and influential recruiter who surrendered to the Indian Government naming [Arun Ferreira](https://youtu.be/7aXo2CtSCIE), [Varavara Rao and Gautam Navlakha](https://youtu.be/7aXo2CtSCIE) as Maoist sympathisers. No one would even mention his testimony when discussing them. And there is the case of letters and evidence recovered from Rona Wilson's laptop. Accusing the government of fabricating the evidence is a argument that is given. Then there is a case of Akhil Gogoi who is accused of being a Maoist not by the central government but by [Assam's previous congress government](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/anticorruptionactivistamaoistinassamreport/590798/0). Why should they also be not be treated with scepticism.\n\nFor the third question, should we allow Maoists or not. I would ask you a simple question, would you allow ISIS to recruit from the city provided it's recruiter use non-violent protest? Maoists want to overthrow the government by any means necessary and the casualties of our forces has been more on the Maoist front than in Kargil, the fucking Kargil war. Left or right, for the Maoist threat we need to be united in our opposition to it.\n\nNow there is a problem for sure. NGOs being infiltrated by Maoists are discrediting even the NGOs and activists who are there solely for their good intentions. We can't expect the government to clean up the NGOs when their priority is national security. NGOs themselves have to take a strong stance against Maoism to counter that. That's the only solution that would work long term and ensure the safety of our Republic."<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'i0i02l'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/i0i02l/why_maoism_needs_to_be_opposed/</li>

Books are complete, but essays, articles etc are fragments. Sometimes these essays, articles and so on, reflect the primordial beliefs of the authors. That way, they are lamp posts of thoughts. \n\nSimilarly, the Constitution, most people think of it as a text, a social document. But in essence, it is a series of fragments on various social issues, which can be completed through interpretation. The fragments along with its interpretation makes the constitution complete. The fragments grow through amendments, but that doesn\'t make the constitution complete.\n\nGrowth for the sake of growth is the ideology of a cancer cell.

They don't get much salary and now they are having difficult time at home, when they have to buy extra equipment where schools are not helping either. If they don't do, they will loose their jobs.\n* **Parents -** [Parents in a Pandemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hCNi4xuZoo&amp;feature=youtu.be)  \nThey have to manage all homeschooling as online method is only 20–30%. They also have to justify their time working from home when lot of the time they have to attend to kids and household chores without domestic help. They have experienced salary cuts and job losses in many cases or others are not sure whether their businesses will revive or they will even get salary next month or not. \n* **Schools -** [Schooling in a Pandemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqoDREdRzOA)  \nSchools are forcing full annual fee, eve when not being able to open school or provide the full service that parents have paid for. Tuition fee is only 15% of annual fee, still they are cutting salaries of teachers and freezing the teaching positions. Major component of the Annual fee is Building Fund and Infra charges (also these usually go into creating a new branch or building or playground etc). While they have to pay rent or EMI, none of physical facilities are used, so they ideally they need to share the load from previous profitable years. Also, teachers are employee of schools, not parents. Parents have paid their household, businesses have paid their workers for several months without work. But schools are not ready to do that. They want to keep their profits and revenues intact. It is a shame!\n* **Government**  \nGovernment, as usual, is not able to provide education to all or regulate the private schools. They have to audit the schools which are saying they cannot pay teachers small salaries after decades of huge profits every year. Agree small playschools are having problem, but regular big schools have enough funds. We have TRAI that can regulate Rs 150 recharge, but there is no School regulation authority that will regular 1–2 Lac annual fee from each kid’s family every year. It is a shame!\n* **School Fee -** [School Fee in pandemic](https://youtu.be/fsSKzU0alJI)  \nBiggest thing is politicians have a big stake in the schools.

Udasis and Nirmalas, former of which abided a Vedantic understanding of the Sikh canon were considered heretical and were to be "integrated" with the more Abrahamist-ruling Tat Khalsa.\n\nIn addition, they demanded 6 border districts to be integrated with this new Sikh Punjab and the bordering states of Haryana, J&amp;K, Himachal and Delhi to put into place Punjabi as the second language. Haryana (where I hail from) hated this so much that they put Tamil in its place.\n\n&gt;पंजाब में हिंदुओ पर हिंसा होने पर उसने उसकी कड़ी निंदा भी की। (Bhindranwale strongly condemned the violence against Hindus in Punjab)\n\nObjectively false. Bhindranwale called for each Sikh to kill 32 Hindus. He even threatened to kill 5000 Hindus if the government delayed the minibus he sent to get Amrik Singh.\n\nHis followers were responsible for numerous incidents of massacres of Hindus in the state.\n\nKhushwant Singh writes:\n\n&gt;Did the Sikhs deserve to be taught a lesson? I pondered over the matter for many days and many hours and reluctantly admitted that Hindus had some justification for their anger against Sikhs. The starting point was the emergence of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale as a leader. He used vituperative language against the Hindus. He exhorted every Sikh to kill 32 Hindus to solve the Hindu-Sikh problem. Anyone who opposed him was put on his hit list and some eliminated. His hoodlums murdered Lala Jagat Narain, founder of the Hind Samachar group of papers. They killed hawkers who sold their papers. The list of Bhindranwale\'s victims, which included both Hindus and Sikhs, was a long one. More depressing to me was that no one spoke out openly against him. He had a wily patron in Giani Zail Singh who had him released when he was charged as an accomplice in the murder of Jagat Narain. Akali leaders supported him. Some like Badal and Barnala, who used to tie their beards to their chins, let them down in deference to his wishes. So did many Sikh civil servants. They lauded him as the saviour of the Khalsa Panth and called him Sant. I am proud to say I was the only one who wrote against him and attacked him as a hate-monger. I was on his hit list and continued to be so on that of his followers—for 15 long years—and was given police protection which I never asked for.\n\nThis should be enough to show that he had created terror in Punjab.\n\n&gt;मैं आपसे निवेदन करूंगा कि आप उस वीडियो को देख ले। (I implore you to watch the video)\n\nDone.\n\nPart 1: Did not find\n\nPart 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl1vIWDhnEE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl1vIWDhnEE)\n\nPart 3:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp7l6yCLL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp7l6yCLL4)\n\n&gt;भिंडरावाले पर जगत नारायण की हत्या का आरोप लगा था जो कि आज तक साबित नहीं हो पाया। (There has been no evidence to this day of the accusation of Bhindranwale\'s  role in the killing of Lala Jagat Narain)\n\nThere has been a lot of evidence pointing out to Bhindranwale\'s role in the murder:\n\n&gt;And in one edition Lala had written in an editorial comment that Taura \\[Tohra, then president of the S.G.P.C.\\] and Ajnoha \\[then *jathedar* of the Akal Takht\\] are traitors. On that day in a great fury he \\[Bhindranwale\\] called upon someone to read aloud what Lala had said. There was quiet. \'Our turban has been torn from our heads,\' he proclaimed. Then one of his followers asked, \'What are your orders?\' Again in anger, he said \'Orders, you need orders! What orders? Are you blind?\' Now you see he did not say anything.

In Hindu country no another relgion will be allowed. Sikhs too should get their own country or can remain in the secular country .\n\n\nEven if we get 20 crore Hindus this will be more then enough for us . Countries like Japan too have only 12 crore population but are much better than India.\n\nThe truth is majority of Hindus (at least 60-70 crore) will agree to such a country .\n\nLibrandus can live with muslims in secular country .\n\nBut one thing is clear no another relgion will be allowed in that country .

      <li>Title::: 'INDIA MARCHES TO ITS OWN TUNE – It is the only country with the scale to match China but it will not be the next China. Or the USA or East Asia.'<br />Body: "No Indian Government will be able to direct the economy in the way China does. Nor will it ever have the control over the allocation of resources which has been intrinsic to China's economic success. China has a discipline to its economic planning which flows from its one party political system and the competence of its state institutions. Also for all its diversity, China has a strong Han Chinese core which has no counterpart in the linguistic and cultural diversity of India. \n\nComparisons with China only get in the way of understanding the nature of the opportunities in the Indian market. India's economy will be big but not as big as China's (which is currently five times its size). China's economy would have to crash and India's grow at over 10 per cent a year for several decades for India to catch up. Neither is likely.  \n\nNor will India's economic model mirror that of East Asia's. Its growth will be driven by consumption and services, not exports. It has demographics on its side, a long entrepreneurial tradition, an expanding consumer class, significant headroom for productivity improvements and the confidence that comes from a strong sense of its civilisational pedigree and destiny.\n\n**The drivers of Indian growth are deeply structural which suggests they are also sustainable.** They include the urbanisation of the world's largest rural population, the gradual movement of the informal economy, currently comprising 90 per cent of India's workers, into the formal economy, a young demographic with a mean age of 27, considerable investment in infrastructure, and the beginnings of an ambitious program to upskill 400 million Indians.\n\nThese structural drivers will likely keep India on a relatively strong growth path. Taking a moderate view of the rate of growth out to 2035, assuming that it will be in the order of 6–8 per cent each year over the next 20 years. This assumes incremental rather than radical structural reforms. But for what is already the world's fastest growing large economy to grow by 6–8 per cent each year for the next two decades will still be transformative for India itself, its region and its economic partners.\n\nFirst, India is best seen not as a single economy but as an aggregation of very different state economies, each growing at different rates, driven by different strengths, led in different ways and likely to continue to be uneven in their progress.\n\nSecond, competitive federalism is becoming a larger part of the underlying dynamic of the Indian economy. It is encouraged by the centre and is being enthusiastically embraced by the states, especially those five states which produce 70 per cent of India's exports.\n\nThird, many of the hardest structural reforms holding back the Indian economy, such as land access and labour market regulation, are more likely to be progressed by state governments rather than centrally.\n\nFourth, as barriers to trade across state borders reduce, and the introduction in 2017 of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) was the single biggest step in this direction, labour and capital will gravitate towards those states which offer the best conditions and prospects for business. \n\nIt will by 2035 overtake China as the world's most populous country. This means a deep domestic market which will likely make India the world's third largest economy by 2035 after China and the United States measured by market exchange rates. It is already the third largest economy measured by purchasing power parity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--  [AN INDIA ECONOMIC STRATEGY TO 2035 NAVIGATING FROM POTENTIAL TO DELIVERY](https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/india/ies/pdf/dfat-an-india-economic-strategy-to-2035.pdf) (Australian Strategy Report)"<br />Author: 'pras'  id: 'hye5dn'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hye5dn/india_marches_to_its_own_tune_it_is_the_only/</li>

What happened on 5th July 1931? They forgot that it was Sheikh Abdullah and his partner who planned the attack to get Gilgit Agency handed over to the Anti-Communist English to keep a check on Commie Invasion. Jammu Genocide happened after the Pakthun/Mujahid(Operation Gulmarg) invasion took place otherwise Muslims were being transported to West Pakistan.\n\nWhat I believe is, if ever, Kashmir gains independence, violently or non-violently, It will turn into Afghanistan. Warlords(Badr, LeT, LF, HeM) fighting with each other to gain power over Kabul=Srinagar with every country from Turkey to US poking its nose. If Sikhs and Hindus remain in the Islamist controlled territory, their condition will be incomparable to Afghani ones.\n\nHence, to protect the minorities of Kashmiris, Panoon Kashmir for Koshuri Sikhs and Hindus should be exclusively formed for them and get them settled back in their homeland away from the unstable land."<br />Author: 'ShantanuSingh42'  id: 'hy2izd'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hy2izd/my_take_on_how_kashmiri_issue_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Misplaced priorities of Liberal Muslims and Ex Muslims'<br />Body: "So,as the title says. I've actually seen a lot of Ex Muslims in India normally stay silent in their criticism of Islam and the Muslim community,and even stay silent when fellow Atheists and Religious liberals of a different Community get slammed as Communal rabid hate mongerers (Shashi Tharoor was slammed as a hate mongerer for opposing religious slogans,Ramcharan Guha was slammed as a hate mongerer for calling the burkha as a trishool). \n\nI'd understand their silence if they would have adopted a silence in matters of the Hindu community and Hinduism or if they'd have maintained that they have a bias towards Islam. However,it is not so. When inquired upon,they give the following reason-\n\n&gt;Muslims in India are oppressed and therefore it doesn't make sense to criticise them in this hour. \n\nOn the face of it,the argument sounds valid,but there are counter points I'd like to discuss. Here is the brief-\n\n1. No member of a Community,however small it is,has the right to engage in actions which disturb communal harmony. It simply doesn't make sense to give smaller communities a leeway just because of the implicit assumption that they're disadvantaged due to their numbers. \n\nThe classical mindset which works in this way is that both the Community,the majority Community and a minority Community are on the same level of radicalism and therefore the minority community is at a disadvantage,but that's a plain falsity.\xa0 While we have no barometer to measure the Liberal-ness of a community, acceptance of Homosexuality is one barometer. \n\nIn India, acceptance of homosexuality is low,but according to India today,Hindus are the most accepting community,then come Muslims and then come Christians. Hindu acceptance stands at 22%. So,it can be said to some extent that Muslims are a bit more conservative than the Hindus. Now,this gap is even widened if you'd look at America,Hindus have an acceptance rate of 72% while the Muslims just at the bottom with 50s. Therefore,it can be said that Hindus and Muslims stand on different pedestals of conservatism wrt to each other. With this in mind,in case of India and the US,it can be said that there exists a situation of a relatively tolerant Community alongside a relatively Religious Community.\xa0 The reasons of conservatism can be varied. Some might say that poverty might play a factor (that doesn't make sense since UP is cited to be more tolerant than Kerala). Some might say that Religion might be a problem. Some say counter radicalization is a problem. Etc etc. That's not the point. The main issue to which the above serves as an adduce is that\xa0 in many countries,Muslims serve as a relatively conservative minority, including India. Muslims in Non Muslim majority states are relatively more conservative than their non Muslim counterparts while Muslim majority countries continue to harbour regressive laws,laws much more regressive than non Muslim nations. \n\n\nNow that we've ascertained the fact that the minority is a bit more conservative compared to the majority,we should think,does it tip the balance? One might still assume that a small but rather conservative minority still won't have any determinal effect on the society but the small fringe in the majority population would still outnumber the whole of the conservatives of the minority community and therefore is much of a danger. However,this is not the case everywhere. A case point of UK for example. UK has suffered a lot of terror attacks of late which were carried out by Muslim terrorists. Of what I know,there have been no to few White Nationalist terror attacks in recent times. So, doesn't this break the assumption of the Majority Community's fundamentalists being more of a danger due to their high numbers? Yes it does. How can this be explained though? This brings us to the next topic which is extremely controversial. \n\n\nIe The relative strictness of the Religion itself. It takes no amount of brains to deduce that Peaceful Buddhism is not the same as Peaceful Islam. While peaceful Buddhism calls for a complete shunning of violence with Buddha as an example, peaceful Islam still refers Prophet Muhammad to be a warrior and extolls his virtues in the battlefield. This can't be ignored. Nor should it be. The ideas or opinions of a Quaker on war are very different than that of a Sufi on war. Infact many Sufis themselves have been warriors. This is not to say that Sufism isn't peaceful as compared to other groups of Islam. However,one has to understand that every Religion is different,and therefore to simply put them in silos is silly. You can substitute any Religion and see the difference. So,this might in part (the other part is answered by moderation) answer the question of as to how despite many countries having conservatives of the majority Community don't see as many terror attacks as committed by say Al Qaeda or the Islamic state. Even in states such as India or the US,Islamist terror attacks are often quite disproportional to the size of the Community. If I sound a bit Pro Hindu,let me cite another example to make it more clear. The castism among Hindus is much more of a problem than it is among Muslims. Why? It's simply because there is No Castism in Islam. Therefore a Muslim has a very different idea of what the caste is. This probably lays to rest any accusation of me being Pro Hindu. \n\n\n&gt; Minorities when pushed to a corner by majoritarian criticism tend to become more radicalised. \n\nThis is again a very tempting idea but then it hasn't been observed everywhere. I'll give you examples-\n\na. Minorities in Iraq and Iran haven't been accused of Terrorism. Rather,despite facing extreme persecution,Bahais have stood steadfast on the path of peace and have shunned violence. \n\nb. Minorites in Pakistan are discriminated against but haven't adopted the route of Terrorism. \n\nc. There is no record of any Religious terror attack carried out by a Non Muslim in Saudi Arabia despite Non Muslims being severely discriminated against. \n\nApart from this,this seems to have an assumption that Non Muslim majority states are de-facto oppressive. However,it would be naive to call states such as America,Brazil,Sweden and the UK oppressive. Everyone knows that these are free states. Even if India is being oppressive and therefore counter radicalizing people,one doesn't understand as to how the similar radicalization and or Conservatism has been\xa0 observed in Secular Non Muslim majority states (esp UK) as well. Unless,one were to assume that counter radicalism due to the conservativism of the Majority Community plays no to little role,one can't explain the prevalence of Islamic Fundamentalism in countries regardless of their oppression towards Muslims. This radicalization has been observed in Muslim majority countries as well. This ofcourse can't be shunned out as a product of radicalization of the majority. \n\nThe above info tries to explain that Islamic radicalism can't be explained as a phenomenon of counter radicalism against the Radicalism of the Majority Community since it's vociferous even in place where Non Muslims are a minority. So that's where the Exmuslims are wrong once again. Coming specifically to India,many Ex Muslims believe that India's majority community has radicalized since 1992 and that explains the counter radicalism of the Muslims. However,this doesn't make sense. There was enough conservatism to see the Court's alimony decision as a threat to Islam. Nor can one explain the existence of the Jamaat E Islami. \n\n\nLastly, without sounding offensive,one can't help but observe something. Exmuslims tend to be conservative in Muslim majority countries because they fear that any criticism of Islam would be dangerous to them. Exmuslims in Non Muslim majority countries tend to be a bit conservative in their criticism since they feel it would play in the hands of the right or they feel that minority communities shouldn't be criticised because they're at a disadvantage. So,what this does is,it makes criticism to be absent in Muslim majority states while it makes criticism to be absent in Non Muslim majority states too. All this,while other religions are criticised in both societies. \n\n\nPS-I don't mean to offend Communities. Ex Muslims and Liberals are well meaning people. Ofcourse they have good intentions in their minds."<br />Author: 'bhopadbhopad'  id: 'hy1ulx'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hy1ulx/misplaced_priorities_of_liberal_muslims_and_ex/</li>

Having said that, it is true that many people in the west, including scientists, have been keen scholars of Vedas/Geeta and continue to be so. Probably more in number than Hindus interested in the subject, and this is definitely a deplorable fact.\n\nYet, I feel that the frequent mention in popular 'right-wing' discourse of how the west is influenced by Vedas is often used by Hindus (right-wing or otherwise) as a form of validation of their own religious beliefs.

There should be a more concerted effort by the people and not just the Indian government, to bring back Vedic philosophy &amp; sciences to the standards &amp; acceptance they deserve.\n\nYes, this may mean using modern/western methods to examine and confirm the veracity &amp; limitations of the Vedas, at least to whatever extent it can be done.

Its sounds logical to me. Are this also mixed in Corona count? I may be going in the realm of conspiracy but things are not adding up. The reporting of underlying disease is completely absent. Every death is being given a convenient "Corona" tag just to run away from responsibilities. Many people are indeed dying because of pathetic conditions at the hospitals where treatment is not performed on time under the fear of "Corona" suspicion tag. If you have any similar doubts or something to share or vent out your frustration then please by all means speak your mind.\n\nEdit: I understand your dilemma but downvoting will not help.'<br />Author: 'tmkco'  id: 'hxi7rr'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hxi7rr/how_many_people_use_to_die_in_india_on_a_daily/</li>

As a nation we have utterly nothing to be proud off. All the achievements we have are dwarfed by endless bullshit in our country. You guys keep shitting on china for this or that but they are at least trying to become competent. China has a GDP of 13.61 lakh crores USD with a population of 1.39 billion, that is 7.3 lakh rupees per capita and we on the other hand have GDP of 2.72 lakh crores USD with a population of 1.35 billion, that is 1 lakh rupees per capita. Remember china wasn't always ahead but now they have practically eliminated poverty at less than 1%. I am not here to keep praising china. It is shitty country when it comes to everything else but they at least have competent leaders to get things done.\n\nStop being proud of this shitty country, It doesn't deserve it. If we truly love this land we will do what we can so that some day it will become something we can be proud of."<br />Author: 'Knightron2525'  id: 'hxhzzo'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hxhzzo/india_the_country_where_a_doctor_rapes_a_covid19/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Kerala Gold smuggling case, as of now'<br />Body: '## I. Introduction ^([1])\n\nGold smuggling is not new to Kerala. Last year more than 550 kg of smuggled gold was reportedly seized in the state, a national record. The fact that this smuggling racket was busted at a time when the state is battling the coronavirus pandemic worsens the situation.\n\n## II. Main incident ^([2])\n\nOn July 5, Customs officials at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport seized baggage containing gold weighing over 30 kg and valued at around Rs 15 crore. This gold was inside diplomatic baggage that landed by air cargo, and was addressed to the UAE consulate... baggage concealed in bathroom equipment and electronic devices.\n\n## III. Main culprits ^([1])\n\n**Swapna Suresh:** Main accused, former staffer at the UAE consulate, hired by a private firm to work on a project for Kerala IT department, under CM Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\n**M Sivasankar:** He was Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan\'s principal secretary and headed the IT department under which Swapna Suresh was hired. Sivasankar has been suspended and sacked from his post after his name cropped up in investigation.\n\n**PS Sarith:** A former PRO at the UAE consulate, Sarith is a prime accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case...\n\n**Sandeep Nair:** another key accused in this case\n\n**Fazil Fareed:** He is a Keralite based in the UAE and is a key suspect in this case. The NIA has secured a \'blue colour\' Interpol notice against him.\n\nKerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi  [on July 9] seeking his "intervention for an effective investigation" [Took over the very next day]\n\n## IV. NIA comes in ^([1])\n\n* The investigations in this case started on July 5 with the questioning of PS Sarith, a former employee of the UAE consulate, by Customs.\n\n* Soon after the investigation started, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, absconded and was later tracked down in Bengaluru and arrested.\n\n* The NIA has secured seven-day custody of PS Sarith, who was earlier in the custody of the Customs department.\n\n* Besides this, the NIA also suspects a terror link to this gold smuggling case Case filed by NIA against all four accused under UAPA.\n\n* NIA was able to secure a \'blue notice\' against Fazil Fareed from the Interpol. [He was later arrested](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/07/19/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-faizal-fareed-arrested-in-dubai.amp.html)\n\n* Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan\'s Principal Secretary Sivasankar was summoned by Customs officials and grilled for nearly seven hours [on 15 July] and [once again done on 23rd](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-former-principal-secretary-sivasankar-grilled-for-7-hours/article32085239.ece/amp/)\n\n* The NIA has also started looking into call records between Swapna Suresh and Kerala minister KT Jaleel. \n\n** Investigation so far has revealed that Swapna Suresh had contacts with powerful people in Kerala and made calls UAE consulate general 138 times, PS Sarith 45 times, a diplomatic attaché at the UAE consulate 28 times, besides others.\n\n** The minister has said that these calls were strictly professional,  released WhatsApp chat screenshots which suggest that Swapna was **assigned by the UAE Consulate General to coordinate distribution of food kits during Ramadan**\n\n## V. Political gameplay in Kerala\n\nKerala is set to go to the polls next year, and state Opposition has upped the ante against the ruling government. \n\n(Note that incumbent government always loses the election in Kerala)\n\nThe Opposition has said the National Investigation Agency (NIA) should question CM Pinarayi Vijayan and that he should resign taking moral responsibility for the acts of his principal secretary. \n\n[Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion against the ruling LDF government](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/mobile/news/kerala/will-move-no-confidence-motion-against-speaker-ramesh-chennithala-1.4906897)\n\n[Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala writes to Sitharam Yechury to take action against Mr. Vijayan](http://businessworld.in/amp/article/Ramesh-Chennithala-writes-to-Yechury-says-CM-Vijayan-introduced-consultancy-raj-in-Kerala/20-07-2020-299329)\n\n## VI. NIA findings ^([3])\n\nGold smuggler KT Ramees is the kingpin of the Kerala gold smuggling scam, according to a report submitted by NIA\n\nSandeep Nair stated that Ramees insisted on smuggling gold in large quantity and maximum numbers during lockdown period as the financial position of the county is weak\n\nSwapna and other accused conspired to damage to monitory stability of the country by destabilizing the economy. It is suspected that they used the proceeds of gold smuggling to finance terrorism through various means.\n\n## VII. Extra\n\n1.

The diplomatic consignment containing 30kg gold was under the agencies’ radar right from its point of origin\n\n“We’ve been tracking the activities of a few rackets for a while... intelligence inputs specified the activities of a few groups in channelising large consignment of gold from the UAE to Kerala,”\n\n*However* as per Kabir Taneja of Observer Research Foundation\n\n“..if such a claim is being made that these smuggling activities are funding the anti-CAA protests. Unless complete transparent evidence is provided in a court of law, such allegations should be taken with a pinch of salt.”\n\n2.  A CPO-ranked officer and gunman to UAE Consulate General-in-charge Rashid Khamis Al Sheimelli [linked to this case] who went missing, has been found with his wrists slashed. Jayagosh, the gunman to the top UAE diplomat who left the country, was found with his wrist slashed after a suspected suicide bid\n\nhttps://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-uae-consular-attache-s-missing-gunman-found-with-slit-wrists/story-ttblrZIzpEIeCQle5ZaR5J_amp.html\n\n3.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL there were 88 madrasas in India at independence and by 2006, there were estimated over 5 lakh madarsas in India.'<br />Body: '&gt;**Eleven years ago, in a refreshing essay titled, ‘Madrasas and The Making of Muslim Identity’, published in a book, Redefining Urdu Politics in India, (Oxford University Press, New Delhi 2006) a well-known Muslim scholar, Dr. Arjumand Ara had pointed out that “within India, according to government statistics, half a million madrasas are active in which about fifty million students (out of the estimated 15 crore Muslim population at that time) are enrolled. Part time and evening madrasas are not included in this list.”** 5 According to her, the questions of foremost importance are: “Why do madrasas exist? What is the reality behind them? How is that these medieval institutions still flourish in an otherwise well developed world? \n\n&gt;The quantum jump in the number of madrasas from 88 in 1947 to five lakhs in 2006 across India is a mind boggling narrative of unremitting Islamic aggression.\n\n&gt;Dr. Ara lamented that the “Congress incumbent is planning to organize dini madaris under the canon of a board like the CBSE.” Needless to say that “these madaris are not equipped to compete with schools, nor are they willing to do so. With this kind of wisdom one is surely living in fools’ paradise ………..” wrote Arjumand Ara.  Dr. Ara dubbed ‘dini madaris’ (plural of the word madrasa) as “feudal remnants” which were responsible for keeping the Muslim community educationally backward. The lady scholar of Islam began her essay by quoting a news from Times of India, New Delhi, 17 August, 2002, that 200 students in Basala village, 20 km from Meerut (U.P), had hoisted the Pakistani flag and raised pro-Pak and pro-Osama slogans on Independence Day.\n\n&gt;Now let us turn to Justice Sachar’s claim on page 76 of his factually- fabricated report that only four percent Muslim children attend madrasas. **The assertion made by Justice Sachar in his voluminous report is an unalloyed lie. To confound the Indian nation Sachar report further stated this figure relates only to students between 7 to 9 years age. Interestingly Justice Sachar did not explain in his voluminous treatise that what happens to the children between 5 to 7 years. But on the very next page (i.e., p. 77 of his Report) it has been admitted that these figures relate only to madrasas which are not attached to mosques! It is a mystery why could not Justice Sachar honestly admit the well- established fact that most madrasas are attached to mosques.** Was this obfuscation done by the retired Chief Justice of Delhi High Court to further the cause of radical Islam in India? Well, your guess is as good as mine. \n\n&gt;The institution of Islamic madrasas was introduced in India during the long spell of Muslim rule. It was given a pan-Islamic and fundamentalist orientation in the year 1866 when Darul-Uloom seminary was established at Deoband in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n&gt;Along with madrasas the number of mosques in India has also multiplied manifold courtesy the fund-flow from Gulf countries. Interestingly a disproportionately large number of communal riots take place in India on Fridays after the Maulanas controlling the mosques read inflammatory ‘Khutbas’ eulogizing the waging of jihad along with religious diktats to be followed by the faithful. No wonder, in Kashmir valley, Friday has come to be known among the CRPF personnel as the rioters’ day out! According to late Devendra Mittal, in the year 2009 there were nearly 32 lakh mosques all over India. That was the total number of mosques eight years ago. The exact number mosques in India is not known. Some analysts feel that their number today could be anywhere between 40 and 50 lakhs. Almost every mosque has a madrasa or maktab attached to it for imparting religious knowledge based on the Quran. \n\n&gt;Despite pretentious denials by the Ulemas of Deoband the seminary approves the use of force for propagating pan Islamic ideals, especially jihad. **Its syllabus states: “When the Muslims enter the enemy’s country and besiege the cities or strongholds of the infidels, it is necessary to invite them to embrace the faith, because Ibn Abbas relates of the Prophet that he never destroyed any without previously inviting them to embrace the faith. If, therefore, they embrace the faith, it is unnecessary to war with them, because that which was the design of the war is then obtained without war. The Prophet, moreover has said we are directed to make war upon men only until such time as they shall confess, ‘there is no God, but one God’.** More importantly, the teaching of this syllabus is not confined to the Deoband seminary. It has been prescribed for preaching jihad to young pupils in more than 5,000 madrasas affiliated to the Darul Uloom Deoband all over India\n\n&gt;Before concluding, attention may be drawn to the fact that during the UPA’s regime, in the year 2013 25,000 Wahhabi scholars from 20 countries were permitted to visited India. They toured across 8 Indian States and preached in 7, 000 madrasas to nearly 12 lakh students.10 According to a source, some of the Islamic preachers surreptitiously managed to go to the Kashmir valley, too. Needless to mention, the aim of the 25, 000 Imams was to preach the merits of Sharia law and jihad against kaffir Hindus. Who prompted India’s Muslims First Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, to allow entry to such a large group of jihadi preachers into India remains a closely guarded secret.\n\nhttp://indiafacts.org/galloping-growth-madrasas-india/'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'hwinqv'<br />Score:119<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hwinqv/til_there_were_88_madrasas_in_india_at/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Cool arguments put forth by Sanjeev Sanyal in Land of Seven Rivers.'<br />Body: 'Excerpts from his book.\n\n&gt;One of the persistent misconceptions about Indian history is that Indians have somehow never conceived of themselves as a nation and, consequently, never cared about their history. This idea was often repeated by colonial-era officialdom for obvious political ends. As Sir John Strachey put it in the late nineteenth century, ‘The first and most essential thing to learn about India—that there is not, and never was an India.’ Half a century later, Winston Churchill would echo the same point when he said that ‘India is a geographical term. It is no more a united nation than the equator’.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Curiously, this colonial-era idea has somehow remained alive—it is still not uncommon to hear people, even scholars, say that Indians are an ahistorical people. As we shall see, this is totally incorrect. There is more than enough evidence to show that Indians have long been conscious of their history and civilization. Indeed, from very ancient times, Indians have gone out of their way to record their times as well as to create linkages to those who came before them. This sense of civilizational continuity is so strong that foreign rulers, including the British, have repeatedly acknowledged Indian civilization even as they have tried to give themselves legitimacy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Indeed, the British systematically drew on the political symbolism of India’s past. In front of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace) in New Delhi is a tall column called the Jaipur Column. It is a sandstone shaft topped by the ‘Star of India’. There is an inscription on its base, conceived by Lord Irwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens, that reads as follows: ‘In thought faith,/ In word wisdom,/ In deed courage,/ In life service,/ So may India be great.’ The column was a gift from the princely state of Jaipur and was erected by the British when they built a new imperial capital in the early decades of the twentieth century.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Delhi has several other imperial columns. One stands in the fourteenth-century ruins of Feroze Shah Kotla. The column stands erect amidst the crumbling walls of the old palace complex, oblivious to the cheering crowds of the nearby cricket ground and the swirling traffic of ITO. The polished sandstone shines as if it was put there recently. Yet, this column carries an edict by Emperor Ashoka from the third century BC. It is one of two Ashokan columns that Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq got transported with great care to his new city (the ‘New’ Delhi of its time). This one is said to have been brought from Topara near Ambala, Haryana and erected here in 1356 AD. The other pillar—brought from Meerut—stands near Bara Hindu Rao Hospital on the North Ridge, not far from Delhi University, at the northernmost point of the Aravalli range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Sultan appears to have realized that the two columns were very old and represented a great imperial power. The one in Feroze Shah Kotla is said to have been carefully wrapped in cotton and silk and transported on a forty-two-wheel cart pulled by two hundred men, and finally brought by boat to its current location. The Sultan was very keen to know what the inscriptions said. He asked the local Brahmins to translate them but the Brahmi script had been long forgotten and they were unable to help.3 It would be another five centuries before the script was deciphered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yet another of Delhi’s imperial columns is commonly called the Iron Pillar and stands in the Qutub Minar complex in South Delhi.'<br />Author: 'mech_artist'  id: 'hwbxwc'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hwbxwc/cool_arguments_put_forth_by_sanjeev_sanyal_in/</li>

Efficiency is a good thing. But, on the way, we forgot to focus on something equally important. That is resilience against external shocks. It has taken a global pandemic to remind us how important resilience is.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nGlobal economic resilience can be achieved by stronger domestic economic capacities. This means improved domestic capacity for manufacturing, restoring the health of the financial system and diversification of international trade.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nIndia is contributing towards a prosperous and resilient world through the clarion call of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. And, for that, we await your partnership!\n\n**Friends,**\n\nToday, there is global optimism towards India. This is because India offers a perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options. Let me elaborate. India celebrates openness in people and in governance. Open minds make open markets. Open markets lead to greater prosperity. These are principles on which both India and the USA agree.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nDuring the last six years, we have made many efforts to make our economy more open and reform oriented. Reforms have ensured increased ‘Competitiveness’, enhanced ‘Transparency’, expanded ‘Digitization’, greater ‘Innovation’ and more ‘Policy stability’.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nIndia is emerging as a land of opportunities. Let me give you one example of the tech sector. Recently, an interesting report came out in India. It said for the first time ever, there are more rural internet users than even urban internet users. Imagine the scale! There are about half a billion active internet users in India now. Half a billion connected people. Does this sound huge to you? Hold your breath. Because, there are over half a billion more people who are being connected. Opportunities in technology also include opportunities in the frontier technologies of 5G, Big data analytics, Quantum computing, Block-chain and Internet of things.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nThe options to invest in India are extensive. India invites you to invest in the hard-work of our farmers. India has done historic reforms in the agriculture sector recently. There are investment opportunities in: Agricultural inputs and machinery, Agriculture supply chain management, Ready-to-eat items, Fisheries and Organic produce. India\'s food processing sector is expected to be worth over half a trillion dollars by 2025. To grow more streams of revenue, the best time to tap investment opportunities in Indian agriculture sector is now!\n\nIndia invites you to invest in healthcare. The Healthcare sector in India is growing faster than 22 percent every year. Our companies are also progressing in production of medical-technology, tele-medicine and diagnostics. India and the US have already built a robust partnership in the Pharma sector. To achieve scale and speed, now is the best time to expand your investment in Indian health-care sector!\n\nIndia invites you to invest in energy. As India evolves into a gas-based economy, there will be big investment opportunities for US companies. There are also big opportunities in the clean energy sector. To generate more power for your investment, this is the best time to enter the Indian power sector!\n\nIndia invites you to invest in infrastructure. Our nation is witnessing the largest infrastructure creation drive in our history. Come, be a partner in building housing for millions, or building roads, highways and ports in our nation.\n\nCivil Aviation is another area of great potential growth. The number of Air passengers are expected to more than double within next 8 years. The top private Indian airlines plan to include over a thousand new aircraft over the coming decade. This is a huge opportunity for any investor who chooses to set up manufacturing facilities in India, which can become a base for supplying regional markets. A similar case is obvious for setting up Maintenance Repair and Operations facilities. To give flight to your aviation targets, this is an ideal time to invest in the Indian aviation sector.\n\nIndia invites you to invest in defense and space. We are raising the FDI cap for investment in defense sector to 74 percent. India has established two defense corridors to encourage production of defense equipment and platforms. We offer special incentives for private and foreign investors. A few weeks ago, we cleared path-breaking reforms in the space sector. Come, be a part of these upcoming sectors.\n\nIndia invites you to invest in finance and insurance. India has raised FDI cap for investment in insurance to 49 percent. Now 100 percent FDI is permitted for investment in insurance intermediaries. The insurance market in India is growing at a rate of more than 12 percent and is expected to grow to 250 billion dollars by 2025. With the success of Ayushman Bharat, our health assurance scheme, PM Fasal Bima Yojna, our crop insurance scheme and Jan Suraksha or social security schemes, the government has laid the ground for quick adoption and acceptance of insurance products. There are large untapped opportunities for increasing insurance cover in health, agriculture, business and life insurance. To generate long term and assured revenues, the Indian insurance sector is one of the best investment options right now!\n\nI have given you a few options and that too without any consultancy fees.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nWhen the markets are open, when the opportunity is high and the options are many, can optimism be far behind! You can see the optimism when India rises in key business ratings. Particularly the Ease of Doing Business ratings of the World Bank.\n\nInvestment is the best show of confidence. Every year, we are reaching record highs in FDI. Each year is significantly higher than the earlier one. FDI inflows in India in 2019-20 were 74 billion dollars. This is an increase of 20 percent from the year before that. Friends in USIBC inform that ‘pledged investment’ from the US has already crossed 40 billion dollars this year! Also see what has happened even during the ongoing pandemic. In the middle of COVID, India has attracted foreign investment of more than 20 billion dollars between April and July 2020!\n\nBut, India offers many more opportunities. We have what is needed to power the global economic recovery.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nThe rise of India means: a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale. And a rise your returns on investment with the availability of skilled human resources.\n\n**Friends,**\n\nFor this vision, there are few better partners than the United States of America. India and the USA are two vibrant democracies with shared values. We are natural partners. The US-India friendship has scaled many heights in the past. Now it is time our partnership plays an important role in helping the world bounce back faster after the pandemic. American investors often look out for the perfect timing to enter a sector or a country. To them, I would like to say: there has never been a better time to invest in India!\n\nI once again thank the USIBC leadership for their commitment to advancing India-US economic partnership. May the USIBC keep scaling new heights!\n\n**May the India-America friendship grow further!**\n\n**Namaste!**\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key points from the Speech :**\n\n **1) Addressing the Summit**, PM Narendra Modi said it has taken a global pandemic to remind us how important resilience is. PM Modi said the recent experience has taught the world that the global economy has been too focused on efficiency and optimisation. "Efficiency is a good thing. But, on the way, we forgot to focus on something equally important. That is resilience against external shocks," PM Modi said. \n\n **2) PM Modi said**, today there is global optimism towards India because "India offers a perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options". "Let me elaborate. India celebrates openness in people and in governance. During the last six years, we have made many efforts to make our economy more open and reform oriented. Reforms have ensured increased competitiveness, enhanced transparency, expanded digitisation, greater innovation and more policy stability," he said.\n\n**3) PM Modi said** today India is an emerging destination of new opportunities.

"There are investment opportunities in agricultural inputs and machinery, agriculture supply chain management, ready-to-eat items, fisheries and organic produce," he said.\n\n**5) Stressing upon the** India-US ties, PM Modi said there are few better partners than the United States of America and India. "India and the US are two vibrant democracies with shared values. We are natural partners. The rise of India means a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale," the Prime Minister said in his address to the India Ideas Summit 2020.'<br />Author: 'kuttakameena7654321'  id: 'hw7607'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hw7607/full_text_pm_modis_address_at_india_ideas_summit/</li>

His negative points.\n\nWhen it comes Gandhi, most of us know at least some of his downsides which were being down played or suppressed all this years from us. Now we can read criticisms about him which are verifiable and can form an informed opinion from it. But there's less such details available for Bose. Yes, his contribution to nation building should be discussed but he was not a perfect man. There has to be some of his downsides which are either not being discussed or deliberately suppressed to keep his larger than life image intact. I would request an active participation so that we can ascertain his position from a neutral perspective.

Later ordained as a Priest in Church of England, he came to Poona in 1927 &amp; joined Christa Seva Sangha to "indigenise" Christianity. Earlier the missionaries mainly concentrated on converting people from urban or densely populated areas, though there were already missionary schools running inside heartland of tribal areas, their primary interest was in timber exploitation &amp; mines. What Elwin did was something new, he first abandoned his missionary work &amp; for outside world, he became just another Christian. Slowly he gained confidence of Gandhi &amp; Nehru who were calling the shots in 1930s. (Few claim he converted to Hinduism, but I\'m not sure) The Missionary Elwin stroke the GONDS first, who were spread across Central Bharat forming a huge population, in the name of Anthropology, he started the destruction of their culture &amp; tradition. On 04th April 1940, when he was 38, he married Kosi who was just 13. They had 1 son Jawaharlal in 1941 (Yes, named after dearest friend Nehru) &amp; another named Vijay. In 1949, Elwin Divorced Kaushalaya, suddenly even without prior intimation. (Elwin named her Kosi, as he was unable to spell her name) left her in lurch &amp; joined Nehru for a government job at North East, yes Nehru knew this too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kosi](https://preview.redd.it/owxugitntcc51.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=281ba1ad76831aa927e8edd68872b900d84080eb)\n\nInterview with Kosi - [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south\\_asia/4869778.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4869778.stm)\n\nAfter divorce for few months Elwin sent her 25 Rs &amp; stopped that too, Our great distorian\n\n[@Ram\\_Guha](https://twitter.com/Ram_Guha)\n\nwrote a biography "Verrier Elwin, His Tribal &amp; India" And you know how this Bootlicker Justified the Pedophile &amp; Rapist? Guha wrote - " the memory of the divorce was so wounding that Elwin couldn\'t bring himself to write about his first wife in his autobiography, (The Tribal World of Verrier Elwin) where Kosi &amp; their years of marriage are disposed off in 2 paragraphs. The same Guha in his Makers Of Modern India considered Verrier Elwin as Defender of Indian Tribals. I don\'t understand how these Feminazis tolerate this creep Guha. Nehru in 1949, even after knowing his treachery, appointed Verrier as advisor. Elwin married another tribal girl, Lila another Gond girl and settled with her in Shillong in 1950.\n\nVerrier, waited for this role for 20 years, now he was the Advisor of Tribal Affairs for North East Frontier Agency, he was instrumental in breaking 7 Sisters too. Elwin Advised Nehru to sign another Panchasheel, this was for tribals he said. This agreement banned any outside Contact, Elwin was concerned about Sadhus who were trying to help Adivasis &amp; against Conversion. With this agreement Elwin achieved no new outside interference, but missionaries who were already established deep inside through his 20 year work could operate freely.

My family including me started getting symptoms of coronavirus. We got fever, lost sense of smell, muscle aches for few days, my chest pains a little, some of the family member have headache every now and then, and my father sometimes have difficulty in breathing. \n\nSince each member of our joint family (we live in same house) have got these symptoms and many of them are sick. So, I think this cannot be a normal viral fever. \n\nWe went for testing to only hospital in the district which was doing covid test and then they told us on Friday that they have stopped testing for 2-3 days. They started testing people from Sunday, but they are only registering name of 100 people which definitely isn’t enough for a district have such huge population(applies to any district in bihar).\n\nMy family got tested yesterday and they told me that they’ll call us if any of us tests positive, we didn’t get any call. Contacted the hospital again,they told that they won’t be giving us any report and if you didn’t get call that means you’re negative. \n\nAlso, I observed that there’s no news since last 2-3 days about new cases. So, I am thinking, they are deliberately not calling people and manipulating numbers since Bihar election is coming and this will negatively impact Nitish.\n\nSituation here is pathetic and I am worried for my family.'<br />Author: 'Affectionate_Soup_98'  id: 'hup72b'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hup72b/bihar_government_hiding_corona_cases/</li>

It directed colleges of every state to -\n\n1)  Conduct Final exams for last semester student either Offline, Online or in a "Blended" fashion for the sake of degree\'s integrity. Apparently junior\'s degree\'s Integrity is not important as they have core subjects and labs but last semester\'s is for last three subjects.\n\n2) If offline mode is considered, colleges need to follow SOP guidelines (standard wear masks, social distancing sanitization)\n\nMany state universities including mine , VTU of Karnataka has opted for offline mode of exams which plain stupid for obvious reasons. Compelling Students  to travel from different states in masses, to stay in hostel or whatever accommodation they can find (shared food staff, how to ensure guidelines are followed here?) for three papers after passing 42 papers and 12 labs when cases all over the country are rising with our healthcare system on the brink of collapse (Hospital beds hard to find in Bangalore, Health Minister stating only god can save us now [https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/only-god-can-help-us-now-says-health-minister-b-sriramulu/articleshow/76989001.cms](https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/only-god-can-help-us-now-says-health-minister-b-sriramulu/articleshow/76989001.cms)) is plain stupid.\n\nThe main reasoning for conducting exams is that if COVID stays, we can\'t keep everything on hold and need to adapt. Adapting would mean online exams to which VTU says, we do not have the resources to conduct online exams on this scale hence offline.\n\nAfter raising concerns with my college principal, he just asked us to "Don\'t think , Just study, have faith in the system" which is not possible when the system tries to hide it\'s faults when caught and otherwise carries on with no worries (watch news regarding covid cases, less number of beds, bad hospital conditions, abysmal testing in many states)  \nMost other colleges have similar responses for some reason that evades me  and my friends in all of our collective wisdom, with some teachers reaching out to us and asking us to protest as they cannot.  \n\n\nAnybody who thinks Offline exams are a good Idea, would you send your kid to a different state to stay in shared food based accommodation for a week after somehow managing to stay indoors for all these months?\n\nWe are stuck when it comes to having a conversation with the governing bodies and bringing a change.

She was arrested last Thursday.\nIt turns out that Ayesha is Pragya Debnath, a Sanskrit student from Hoogly in Bengal.\n\n&gt;This is the extent of radicalisation that is happening in Bengal.\n\n&gt;I must tell you this tragic story. It pains me to see how Bengal is changing for the worse. We tend to look at Calcutta when we say "Bengal" but the real radicalisation of young minds is happening in the interiors of Bengal, in the districts.\n\n&gt;Below, is a THREAD on Ayesha Jannat.\n\n&gt;Pragya Debnath was a student at Dhaniakhali college in Bengal.\nHer mother Geeta, is a seamstress and the family bread winner.\nHer father Pradip, a security guard, lost his job during the lockdown. Pragya\'s Class X &amp; XII results were good and she chose to study Sanskrit in college\n\n&gt;While studying in college, she came in contact with a boy of a different community. Turns out, he is a terrorist.They started dating.\n\n&gt;This boy introduced Pragya to online terror groups in Bangladesh. Few months later, Pragya decided to change her religion and marry the boy.\n\n&gt;On September 24, 2016, Pragya left home for Calcutta to boy books.\nShe never returned.\nMonths later, her mother received a call.\nPragya informed that she has changed her religion &amp; married her boyfriend.\nThus was born Ayesha Jannat Mohona, a famous terrorist leader of Bangladesh.\n\n&gt;Pragya landed in Bangladesh.\nShe took had two names. One is her real name (Jannatul Tasmin) but also had another name assigned to her as a terrorist (as is the norm with most terror organisations). That is Ayesha.\nAyesha started off with radicalising young minds in online forums.\n\n&gt;Ayesha then started teaching children in an unregistered madrassa of Bangladesh, widely believed to be the hot-bed of terror indoctrination programmes.\nSoon, there came an opportunity as Bangladesh police arrested Aasmani Khatun, the leader of women\'s wing of Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen\n\n&gt;Ayesha Jannat Mohona became the leader of the Women\'s Wing of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh or JMB from March 2020. She also married a wealthy Bangladeshi terror financier from Oman, over the phone.\nAyesha\'s primary responsibilities were to indoctrinate people in online forums.\n\n\n&gt;Some cops have brushed aside the incident saying that Ayesha wasn\'t involved in an active terror operation and that she wasn\'t high up in the hierarchy.\nThey\'re misinformed about outfits like ISIS where women aren\'t usually involved in ops.\nThey are used to indoctrinate &amp; recruit\n\n&gt;It\'s worrying that the incident wasn\'t known till the National Investigation Agency stepped in.\nAyesha’s arrest came to light three months after the NIA arrested a college student called Tania Parveen, a Laskar-e-Taiba(LeT) member &amp; ISIS agent, in Basirhat of Bengal, during March\n\n&gt;Ayesha\'s arrest confirms an oft-heard rumour that the interiors of Bengal have become a hot bed for terror activities. That the sleeper terror cells of Bangladesh are operating practically unhindered. The activities of several madrassas and religious leaders are suspect\n\n&gt;Here\'s a report on \n@DhakaTribune\n about the arrest of Ayesha. Many Indian news agencies have picked that up since. There are few contradictions about the information I have received and what has been reported here. Nevertheless, basic facts remain the same.\nNeo JMB women’s wing member arrested in Dhaka\nThe arrested is an Indian citizen, according to CTTC\ndhakatribune.com\n\nhttps://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2020/07/17/neo-jmb-women-s-wing-member-arrested-in-dhaka\n\n&gt;Right now, there is no doubt that Bengal is a breeding ground for Islamic terrorists. With ample support and infrastructure from their Bangladeshi counterparts, these terror incubation centres are spawning.\nAnd things may soon spiral out of control.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2020/07/west-bengal-pragya-converted-to-islam-2009-ayesha-jannat-arrested-bangladesh-jbm-terror-link/\n\n\n&gt;A rapidly changing demography &amp; a passive security apparatus, might encourage these terror elements to start large-scale operations in Bengal. They will start neutralising their opponents (read Hindus) in their typical fashion.\nRemember incident below a week back?\n\n&gt;ISIS style execution of Debendranath Ray, a BJP MLA from North Dinajpur in West Bengal, where Hindus are less than 50% of the population.\nDebendra was found hanging in a public square with his hand tied. His family allege murder.\nThe photos of his body are shocking and outrageous'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'hu0wpz'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hu0wpz/this_is_ayesha_jannat_a_popular_leader_of_jamatul/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Is Ashoka's history accurate?"<br />Body: "Something isn't adding up.\n\n1. Ashoka's history was brought to us by the British. We didn't know about his existence prior.\n2. They tell us that he ruled most of India and Pakistan and promoted Buddhism, but the only parts of India that were known to be buddhist were Bengal, Sindh, Punjab, and Kashmir.\n3. His last war was in Kalinga, and his capital was Magadha, in Bihar. So his dynasty conquered Punjab and Gujarat, but waited till the end to conquer neighboring Orissa?\n\nI get the feeling we've been lied to.\n\nThe narrative was:\n\n1. Ashoka converted India to Buddhism.\n\n2. Adisankaracharya converted everyone back to Hinduism. But he started preaching at 16 and died at 32. How did he convert all of India to Hinduism in 16 years?\n\nBack then, both India and China were asking the British to keep the Christian missionaries away. China succeeded relatively.\n\nStories like this gave the British some justification to continue the conversion of India.\n\nLet me know what you think."<br />Author: 'aniramzee'  id: 'htz9bd'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/htz9bd/is_ashokas_history_accurate/</li>
