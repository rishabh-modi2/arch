Only two stalwarts of the Congress could retain their seats. \n* It was an election where there was a Modi wave and extraordinary anti-incumbency against the incumbent government and was also held against the backdrop of the 2013 assembly elections in which the BJP did exceedingly well and got a mandate for the third consecutive term.\n\n**Lok Sabha Elections 2019**\n\n* The BJP’s campaign strategy this time has been to showcase the achievements of the national government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, particularly national security and major welfare schemes.\n* The announcement of the NYAY scheme by the Congress to lure the farming society could be termed as a big attempt to engage a sizeable electorate as Congress has recently already got a benefit of farm loan waiver announcement in the assembly elections of 2018.\n\n**This election has also observed a very aggressive campaign**\n\n* Out of 26 sitting MPs of BJP, 14 were denied party tickets due to adverse internal reports and other considerations. \n* Congress fielded many new faces and as usual there were many aspirants for the party tickets in both the major political parties. \n* Also, many of the sitting MPs of BJP who were denied tickets have shown their displeasure in public.

      <li>Title::: 'Zero — that’s the number of seats we believe the BJP has won in Uttar Pradesh in Phase 6. And we think we know who’s responsible.'<br />Body: 'On Sunday, May 12, eastern UP went to the polls. Besides Azamgarh, the BJP had swept these seats in 2014.  With a BSP candidate contesting the majority of seats, the day was a test for many things — chief amongst which was whether the SP vote would transfer to the BSP or not. We believe that the vote transfer has been seamless.\n\nTraditional SP voters saw BSP voters turn out and vote for their candidates in Western and Central UP in the previous phases. They saw the bonhomie between Mayawati and their chief Akhilesh Yadav. They heard her tell voters in Azamgarh that a vote for Akhilesh Yadav was a vote for her. They turned out in droves to ensure BSP candidates won.\n\nWe expected this to happen and have been saying so for nearly a month now — so this didn’t surprise us.\n\nWhat did surprise us is a potential shift in the Brahmin vote.\n\nOn Sunday, the BJP lost a section of the Brahmin vote it has courted assiduously to the Congress, and shockingly also to the Gathbandhan. Some of this can be attributed to the candidates Mayawati picked. But we believe the bigger reason is Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\nThe anti-Yogi sentiment we picked up in Eastern UP is particularly sharp. And this is a part of the state which isn’t as badly impacted by the stray cows of UP. As we explored it, we realised caste dynamics of the ugliest sort were at play across the region. The Thakurs — the caste to which the Yogi Adityanath belongs — were perceived to have been given the license to behave badly. We had expected this to impact the non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits to a certain extent.\n\nThe unpopularity of the Chief Minister has meant that his vitriol aimed at political opponents has been perceived as thinly veiled contempt for ALL backward classes and castes. The central government’s decision to award reservations to economically weaker sections has only reinforced this impression (it’s talked about as reservation for the upper castes).\n\nBut the impact is deeper and wider than we had imagined.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi has had the impact she said she would. She has accelerated the departure of the disgruntled Brahmin voter — some of it has gone to the Congress, and some to the Gathbandhan. In fact, we believe there’s one seat where the Congress has done very well in this phase.\n\nWe predict the BJP’s vote share fall will be sharper here than in Western UP. And at the end of phase 6, we believe the Gathbandhan will win 53 seats (± 5). The BJP will win 22 (± 3) and the Congress 5 (± 2).\nWhen the BJP go looking for a reason why they lost vote share in UP by the amounts we believe they will, they will have to think back to the time they chose to go with Yogi Adityanath as Chief Minister and wonder if they did the right thing. And they will have to figure out if they will have him to continue for a full term or not.\n\nDespite Narendra Modi’s recent missteps about radar, emails and digital cameras, he remains popular and respected. The Gathbandhan is winning because they have stitched together a winning combination. And the BJP is losing even more because they have the wrong man leading the state.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://anthro.ai/indianelections/notes/he-freed-the-cow-whos-going-to-bell-yogi/'<br />Author: 'prabodh9811'  id: 'bo7ze9'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bo7ze9/zero_thats_the_number_of_seats_we_believe_the_bjp/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Telegraph India article claiming "radar specialists junk Modi\'s ‘cloud theory" is complete bullshit. Fake sources and fiction weaved as a story - TTI\'s speciality'<br />Body: 'This is the article in question: https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/radar-specialists-junk-modi-s-cloud-theory/cid/1690458\n\nIt claims that they contacted few "specialists" who debunk the cloud theory. \n\nLets look closely at this article, and see how Telegraph India makes a complete fool out of its readers. \n\n\nOne of the so called specialist is \n\n&gt; “Radars detect objects on the basis of echoes or signals that bounce off the objects — clouds do not usually impact such echoes or return signals,” said **Shriram Vasudev, assistant professor at the school of engineering, Amrita Visva Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore.**\n\nLets look at his profile from this uni\'s own website: https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/kv-shriram\n\nHe is a computer science assistant professor. Lets look at his career and publications: \n\n&gt;  He has worked with major multinational companies like Wipro and Aricent Technologies; and been to USA on a technical assignment while functioning for WIPRO technologies. He was also closely associated with VIT University. \n\nConferences:\n\n&gt; Conducted a workshop on **Ubuntu internals** as part of the reputed Indicon ’18 IEEE conference in Coimbatore, December 15, 2018.\n\n&gt; Delivered an invited lecture (Keynote) on the topic **“Augmented and Virtual Reality”** at Mohandas College of Engineering &amp; Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala on April 19, 2017. (National Conference: Prabandh\'17)\n\n\nPublications:\n\n&gt; Dr. Shriram K Vasudevan, Nagarajan, A. S., and Sundaram, R. M. D., **Internet of Things**. Wiley India, 2019, p. 332.[Abstract]\n\n\n&gt; Prashant R. Nair, Dr. Shriram K Vasudevan, V, S., and Sundaram, R. M. D., **Software Testing**. Narosa Publishers, India, 2019.\n\n&gt; Prashant R. Nair, Dr. Shriram K Vasudevan, V, S., and Sundaram, R. M. D., **Software Project Management**. 2018.\n\n\nThis dude is a software engineer by profession. How on earth is he termed as a "radar specialist"? \n\nThere is not a hint in his profile that he knows anything about how radars operate. Let alone be a specialist in this field. \n\n----\n\nNow lets look at other "specialists" cited by this fakenews factory telegraph india: \n\n\n&gt; **A senior scientist familiar with surveillance and weather radars** said some radars might be specially tailored to detect water vapour or clouds. “But radar signal passes through the clouds. For example, we can ‘see’ right through a cyclone,” the scientist said.\n\nUnnamed source.\n\n&gt; “The primary radar sends out the waves and its receiver receives the waves sent back. The object can be static like a tall building or moving like an aircraft,” **said another official**. “Even a thick cloud cover cannot prevent the signals from being transmitted.”\n\n\nAnother unnamed source. \n\nSo this article cites one comp sci assistant professor as "radar specialist" and as many as 3 unnamed sources (who given that source #1 is already discredited, I strongly suspect are fictious entities)\n\nMoreover, there is no need to hide your source in this article as this is not an investigation or expose; no name sources speaking about domain specific technical knowhow has zero credibility in any case.  \n\nThis is how TTI has turned it into an art of manufacturing fake news to suit the propaganda of its masters. \n\n\n\n---\n\nOTOH we have Ex German Air Force capt clearly stating on his website about radars that clouds do have an effect.  \n\nhttp://www.radartutorial.eu/07.waves/Waves%20and%20Frequency%20Ranges.en.html\n\n\n\n&gt; "The higher the frequency of a radar system, the more it is affected by weather conditions such as rain or clouds." \n\n\n----\n\nBottom line: Question everything you hear and read in these biased media websites. Majority of these articles are nothing but fake news and propaganda.'<br />Author: 'Alive_Firefighter'  id: 'bo7flw'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bo7flw/telegraph_india_article_claiming_radar/</li>

      <li>Title::: '2016 Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index'<br />Body: 'Hey!\n\nSo we often discuss on this sub how important it is for India to expand its industrial base, so I thought I’d share this link that gave me lots to think about:\n\nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/in/en/pages/manufacturing/articles/global-manufacturing-competitiveness-index.html\n\nIt’s a short read, and an interactive page, so people who are interested should look through. Here are some of the salient points I found pertinent:\n\n1. India’s ranking in 2016 is 11, but Deloitte projects India to rise up to 5th by 2020. China is currently number 1, but they project the US will take the lead by 2020, and by a decent margin, because automation will help increase the sophistication of their manufacturing capabilities, while eroding the advantage China enjoys with cheaper labour. Germany is 3rd, Japan is 4th, South Korea is 6th.\n\n2. But the difference between India and these other countries is stark. Manufacturing GDP in absolute terms in India is only $202.3 bn. The US and China are around $1.8 tn. Japan’s is $1 tn, while Germany’s is $663 bn. Even South Korea’s is $354 bn. When you keep in mind the population and the cheap cost of labour, this is atrocious.\n\n3. Manufacturing only accounts for 12.9% of our gdp. For china, that number is 29.9%. South Korea’s is even higher. We are closer to the already developed US than we are to any developing nation. \n\n4. For all the talk on here of Vietnam becoming an industrial powerhouse, their manufacturing gdp is only $21.3 bn, though presumably increasing fast. That is 17.5% of their gdp. While no country in the ASEAN manufactures more than us in absolute terms, when you consider our population, our lack of progress becomes clear. \n\n5. For the moment, our past colonial overlords are still ahead of us, their manufacturing gdp being $244.8 bn. In fact, various EU countries are ahead of us still, such as France and Italy. \n\n6. Certain countries really stand out. South Korea is amazing, punching way above their weight. Other countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia show they are doing a good job with manufacturing. Taiwan is also pretty awesome, their manufacturing gdp being $178.7 bn. And they’re just an island. All East Asian countries really seem to have learned how to industrialize. \n\nThis is just 1 report, and I haven’t even summarized it fully. People who are interested can play around on that site for some time. \n\nWhen Modi return to power, I really hope he focuses on the following next:\n\n- Reforming labour laws\n- Investing in public education\n- Reforming UGC and increasing high-quality universities\n- Improving infrastructure.\n\nWe need to improve the quality of our labour force quickly, and create more salaried low-skilled jobs.'<br />Author: 'Anon4comment'  id: 'bo4gjx'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bo4gjx/2016_global_manufacturing_competitiveness_index/</li>

AB de Villiers: starred in the two highest ever partnerships in IPL history (229 and 215 with Virat Kohli). Many memorable innings for RCB, most notably a 79 not out chasing (from 31/5) in the 2016 qualifier. \n3. Sunil Narine: un-hittable since his first season in the IPL. Also became a pinch-hitting opener. Has the lowest economy rate in IPL history. Won 2 IPLs.\n4. David Warner: best opener in IPL history. Most runs ever by a foreign player, and most runs ever by a foreigner in a single season (848). A great captain as well, led his team to the title in 2016. \n5. Dwayne Bravo: possibly the best ever all-rounder in IPL history. Two time purple cap winner, one of them being the record for most wickets in a single season til date (32). Won 2 IPLs.\n6. Lasith Malinga: the best bowler in IPL history. Highest ever wicket taker.

I can't imagine anyone beating his highest ever score of 175. \n\nHowever, I cannot ignore Malinga's record. Most decorated player with 4 titles. Highest ever wicket taker in a batsman's game. Consistently good every season. The ideal IPL bowler; a deceptive action, possessing pace, yorker, and a good slower ball.

MS Dhoni’s controversial run out for 2 in the 13th over was one of them which saw MI starting to unravel. But Watson kept his cool and hammered Lasith Malinga for three fours and a six to keep CSK afloat. He later hammered Krunal Pandya for three sixes to further boost Chennai’s hope.\n\nBut the biggest gamechanger came in the final over – when Watson was run out for 80 while trying to steal a double. The next batsman, who came on strike, Shardul Thakur, had to go directly against Malinga. He took a double to bring the equation to two. But Malinga’s game-changing slow ball saw Thakur getting LBW out and CSK losing the match by 1 run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/85hs2knkqux21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Last ball, I thought that if they get one run, it would be a Super Over, but I wanted us to win. So I went for my wicket ball.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Lasith Malinga, Mumbai Indians***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Man of the Match:** **Jasprit Bumrah (2-14)**\n\n&gt;Very happy. We know finals can be close, so wanted to stay calm. Winning fourth title for Mumbai makes me very happy. Today I was surprisingly very calm. Wasn't panicking, just focusing on the next ball. Doesn't help taking extra pressure, instead I back my skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mahendra Singh Dhoni, The Losing Captain (CSK) -**\n\n&gt;As a team we had a good season. But we need to go back and reflect. Wasn't one of those years where we played very good cricket. Middle order never clicked, but somehow we managed. Today was one game we should've done slightly better. It was quite a funny game, we were passing the trophy to each other. Both committed mistakes, and eventually the winning team was the one that committed one mistake less. Our bowlers did really well. It was not a 150 wicket, but the bowlers kept us in the hunt. They kept getting wickets when it was really needed. Batting, someone kept chipping in and we kept winning. To be consistent next year, we will have to really think hard. It's too early to say right now (about next year's plans). Up next is the World Cup. That's the first priority. After that, we will chat about CSK. Nothing against the bowlers, but the batsmen could've done better. Hopefully yes, we'll see you next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rohit Sharma, The Winning Captain (MI) -**\n\n&gt;We played some good cricket. Good to see we qualified in the top two. At the start of the tournament, we wanted to split the tournament into two halves. But credit to the entire squad, not just the XI. Even the support staff as well. Our bowling in this tournament was excellent. At different stages, our bowlers put their hands up and brought us back in the game. Every bowler who got an opportunity put their hand up, whatever condition we played in. We backed our ability and our skills, and that's probably why we got rewards. About Malinga, that's what champions do. I had confidence in him despite a poor third over. He also had confidence he could do it. I thought we could use Hardik for the 20th, but wanted to back someone who has done it for us. Malinga has done it many times in the past, so not a very difficult decision. As a captain, I am learning every game and every tournament. But need to give credit to the team. Firmly believe captain is representative of this team. Players make the captain look good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d1hhnknpqux21.png\n\n**Mahela Jayawardene, Mumbai Indians Coach -**\n\n&gt;Thought we had the game when MS got out, but then Watto started hitting. Some great decisions by Rohit, going back to experienced bowlers at the death. This is why we wanted to defend. Wanted to take a punt with Pollard while batting since he is good against CSK. Asked him to get us out off the mess, and he did so. Big players come to the party in big games. Young Rahul Chahar came off age too. Held his nerve on a wicket where there wasn't much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sachin Tendulkar -**\n\n&gt;The key moment was Dhoni's run-out. But also in patches when Bumrah bowled those critical to even out Malinga's one poor over was also crucial. And the last over, thought Malinga finished the game out beautifully. And as for the final, we knew we defended 129 in the final two years ago, so we were confident. I think we have a terrific team - with experience and youth. As Mahela said, Rahul Chahar stands out the way he's bowled this season. Just fabulous. And don't forget Hardik. We were in the corner in many games this season, and Hardik bailed us out many times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nvu54cqrqux21.png"<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'bnuq0g'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bnuq0g/ipl_2019_champions_mumbai_indians_recordbreaking/</li>

Nuance be damned.\n\nJust so you know, all Indian parties are to some extent economically left-wing, all of them are to some extent socially conservative.\n\nOur parties differentiate themselves through their strategies to address colonial trauma - some are focused on cultural revivalism, some on self-respect for indigenous philosophies, some promote parochial, regional, or subaltern interests, and some on enriching their founders.\n\nThis impression that the "liberal-conservative" divide in postcolonial societies is somehow analogous to Western politics is either projection by Western media and academics or ...... a reflection of the deracination and mental colonisation of the Anglicised postcolonial elite, who act as the West\'s interlocutors to a set of indigenous cultures and languages they perceive as inferior.\n\n*It\'s not taxi drivers whose jobs are at risk from self-driving cars in India, it\'s English-media journalists who will be rendered unemployed, as their only window into the political or cultural views of India is conversations with the driver who picked them up from the airport.*\n\nIf it were the case that these people genuinely cared about the left or liberal cause, and genuinely felt that they can\'t relate to Indian culture enough to be a part of politics in India, fair enough. Go to the UK, join a party, fight an election. Move to NY, write for the NYT.\n\nIf they did that, we would have respect for them, as we do for Dadabhai Naoroji.\n\nBut the reality is, they won\'t do that. They can\'t do that.\n\n*They are only useful to Western liberals as compradors and fixers who help them navigate Indian politics, history, or culture.*\n\n*They can only get a column in the Graun, BBC, or WaPo if it\'s to shame other Indians and rob them of agency.*\n\nTheir awards for their journalism in India are merely pats on the head for being pliant. If they were actually respected, they would be entrusted with UK/US politics.\n\nAs soon as they stop toeing the line or try to engage with politics in the West the way they report on India, they are brutally cut down to size. They don\'t get to host debates on CNN or the BBC. Because just like in their South Delhi homes, servants don\'t get to eat at the table.\n\nNobody takes them seriously outside of their established Uncle Tom role, simply because they have no self-respect.\n\nThat is why all they can do is pontificate from a studio or newspaper column, write clickbait for the elite, or get into fistfights with subaltern Indians abroad.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ruchirsharma_1/status/1114959389620932610\n\nI have said similar things many times.

Plus, weather degrades electro-optic sensors - short range air defence systems r often guided by EO. \nX-Band  radar (2-4cm) penetrate cloud/rain, but effectiveness is degraded esp in clutter heavy env (mountains). \nThere is signal attenuation/ clutter created by rain/cloud/dust. That diminishes radar performance. \n\nDegradation likely more pronounced where  base env ( mountains) is anyway adding clutter. \n\nThe Signal Processing algos have to deal with more noise; discrimination  harder. Civilian Aircraft carry transponders to identify them (broadcast). The Secondary radars they squak to operate around 1000MHz (L-band)  30 cm.\nThe signal degradation is much lower compared to X-band (see the curve in the fist picture).The primary radars at airports have a shorter wavelength (S-band) but still higher than the X-band used for many military applications. \n\nThink of number of bars on  cell phone. Voice quality/ speed drops as signal becomes weaker; inside/outside building makes a difference.\n\nFor mil radar, effectiveness (detection range, discriminating # of planes, lock-range) degrades due to signal attenuation in X-Band"<br />Author: 'indie_loverr'  id: 'bnmxru'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bnmxru/regarding_modis_comment_on_cloud_cover_affecting/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Aatish Taseer's article in WSJ (July 2011 ) on his father's India Rocket Tweet."<br />Body: 'Ten days before he was assassinated in January, my father, Salman Taseer, sent out a tweet about an Indian rocket that had come down over the Bay of Bengal: "Why does India make fools of themselves messing in space technology? Stick 2 bollywood my advice."\n\nMy father was the governor of Punjab, Pakistan\'s largest province, and his tweet, with its taunt at India\'s misfortune, would have delighted his many thousands of followers. It fed straight into Pakistan\'s unhealthy obsession with India, the country from which it was carved in 1947. \n\nThough my father\'s attitude went down well in Pakistan, it had caused considerable tension between us. I am half-Indian, raised in Delhi by my Indian mother: India is a country that I consider my own. When my father was killed by one of his own bodyguards for defending a Christian woman accused of blasphemy, we had not spoken for three years.\n\nTo understand the Pakistani obsession with India, to get a sense of its special edge—its hysteria—it is necessary to understand the rejection of India, its culture and past, that lies at the heart of the idea of Pakistan. This is not merely an academic question. Pakistan\'s animus toward India is the cause of both its unwillingness to fight Islamic extremism and its active complicity in undermining the aims of its ostensible ally, the United States.\n\nThe idea of Pakistan was first seriously formulated by neither a cleric nor a politician but by a poet. In 1930, Muhammad Iqbal, addressing the All-India Muslim league, made the case for a state in which India\'s Muslims would realize their "political and ethical essence." Though he was always vague about what the new state would be, he was quite clear about what it would not be: the old pluralistic society of India, with its composite culture.\n\nIqbal\'s vision took concrete shape in August 1947. Despite the partition of British India, it had seemed at first that there would be no transfer of populations. But violence erupted, and it quickly became clear that in the new homeland for India\'s Muslims, there would be no place for its non-Muslim communities. Pakistan and India came into being at the cost of a million lives and the largest migration in history.\n\nThis shared experience of carnage and loss is the foundation of the modern relationship between the two countries. In human terms, it meant that each of my parents, my father in Pakistan and my mother in India, grew up around symmetrically violent stories of uprooting and homelessness. \n\nBut in Pakistan, the partition had another, deeper meaning. It raised big questions, in cultural and civilizational terms, about what its separation from India would mean.\n\nIn the absence of a true national identity, Pakistan defined itself by its opposition to India. It turned its back on all that had been common between Muslims and non-Muslims in the era before partition. Everything came under suspicion, from dress to customs to festivals, marriage rituals and literature. The new country set itself the task of erasing its association with the subcontinent, an association that many came to view as a contamination.\n\nHad this assertion of national identity meant the casting out of something alien or foreign in favor of an organic or homegrown identity, it might have had an empowering effect. What made it self-wounding, even nihilistic, was that Pakistan, by asserting a new Arabized Islamic identity, rejected its own local and regional culture. In trying to turn its back on its shared past with India, Pakistan turned its back on itself.\n\nBut there was one problem: India was just across the border, and it was still its composite, pluralistic self, a place where nearly as many Muslims lived as in Pakistan. It was a daily reminder of the past that Pakistan had tried to erase. \n\nPakistan\'s existential confusion made itself apparent in the political turmoil of the decades after partition. The state failed to perform a single legal transfer of power; coups were commonplace. And yet, in 1980, my father would still have felt that the partition had not been a mistake, for one critical reason: India, for all its democracy and pluralism, was an economic disaster.\n\nPakistan had better roads, better cars; Pakistani businesses were thriving; its citizens could take foreign currency abroad. Compared with starving, socialist India, they were on much surer ground. So what if India had democracy? It had brought nothing but drought and famine.\n\nBut in the early 1990s, a reversal began to occur in the fortunes of the two countries. The advantage that Pakistan had seemed to enjoy in the years after independence evaporated, as it became clear that the quest to rid itself of its Indian identity had come at a price: the emergence of a new and dangerous brand of Islam.\n\nAs India rose, thanks to economic liberalization, Pakistan withered. The country that had begun as a poet\'s utopia was reduced to ruin and insolvency.\n\nThe primary agent of this decline has been the Pakistani army. The beneficiary of vast amounts of American assistance and money—$11 billion since 9/11—the military has diverted a significant amount of these resources to arming itself against India. In Afghanistan, it has sought neither security nor stability but rather a backyard, which—once the Americans leave—might provide Pakistan with "strategic depth" against India.\n\nIn order to realize these objectives, the Pakistani army has led the U.S. in a dance, in which it had to be seen to be fighting the war on terror, but never so much as to actually win it, for its extension meant the continuing flow of American money. All this time the army kept alive a double game, in which some terror was fought and some—such as Laskhar-e-Tayyba\'s 2008 attack on Mumbai—actively supported.\n\nThe army\'s duplicity was exposed decisively this May, with the killing of Osama bin Laden in the garrison town of Abbottabad. It was only the last and most incriminating charge against an institution whose activities over the years have included the creation of the Taliban, the financing of international terrorism and the running of a lucrative trade in nuclear secrets.\n\nThis army, whose might has always been justified by the imaginary threat from India, has been more harmful to Pakistan than to anybody else. It has consumed annually a quarter of the country\'s wealth, undermined one civilian government after another and enriched itself through a range of economic interests, from bakeries and shopping malls to huge property holdings.\n\nThe reversal in the fortunes of the two countries—India\'s sudden prosperity and cultural power, seen next to the calamity of Muhammad Iqbal\'s unrealized utopia—is what explains the bitterness of my father\'s tweet just days before he died. It captures the rage of being forced to reject a culture of which you feel effortlessly a part—a culture that Pakistanis, via Bollywood, experience daily in their homes.\n\nThis rage is what makes it impossible to reduce Pakistan\'s obsession with India to matters of security or a land dispute in Kashmir. It can heal only when the wounds of 1947 are healed. And it should provoke no triumphalism in India, for behind the bluster and the bravado, there is arid pain and sadness.\n—Mr. Taseer is the author of "Stranger to History: A Son\'s Journey Through Islamic Lands." His second novel, "Noon," will be published in the U.S. in September.\n\n[Link to paywalled article ]( https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304911104576445862242908294 )'<br />Author: 'wowmir'  id: 'bn75mz'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bn75mz/aatish_taseers_article_in_wsj_july_2011_on_his/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'There is literally no justice in India. My advice to you: have no hopes for the future of India. You are strongly advised to move elsewhere and build your future there. India is the future of nothing.'<br />Body: '**TLDR**: *I and my friends (we were 15 years old) were illegally detained and beaten up by the police and they extorted money from the parents for releasing us. Authorities lied to us in order to demand bribes and later sent the police, who demanded more.*\n\n**Warning: Very long post. However, it will be worth your time.**\n\n\nHere is the face of corruption in India which most other Indians on /r/india have been fortunate to have never witnessed.\n\nPrevious answers have said so much about various aspects of corruption in India. Surely, almost everything that could be said has already been said.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only wish that were the case.\n\nAll the other answers by Indians have something in common... they are written by reasonably well to do Indians who can write in English quite well and are able to write an essay length answer on Quora. This gives a hint about the demographic answering this question. This demographic also has a sense of their rights (the importance of this idea will become clear later).\n\nI belong to this demographic now... but I was part of a very different one during my childhood. The corruption faced by the latter demographic is quite different, as you will soon see. In addition to all the forms of corruption already stated, there are many unique ones faced by the lower economic classes. I will only talk about those.\n\nA little background to set the ground work...\nI come from a relatively poor and very densely populated place in New Delhi, where I had an exciting childhood growing up with a large number of friends (~25) and spent all my childhood mostly playing cricket. Understandably, education was not a high priority. Only 7 of these friends stayed in school beyond 10th grade and just 4 went on to study beyond the 12th grade. I was the only one who went on for graduate studies.\nA couple of my friends are bus drivers/conductors in red/blue line buses (people from Delhi know what this means) and a few others work as office peons - basically the Rs 3k-6k ($80) monthly salary bracket.\nMy parents had emigrated to New Delhi 10 years before I was born, in search of a better life. Hindi and English were not their best languages, but they got by.\n\nHere we go...\n\n**1. "Do not go to the police, no matter what".**\n\nMy sister was told by my parents - "In case of any incident (molesting, purse snatching, etc), DO NOT go to a police station - especially never after dark and never alone. Catch an auto rickshaw and come home right away...".\n\nThis might be surprising to some... but enough incidences of poor young women being molested inside the police stations were known that this was just common sense of the land. And this is more of a poor neighborhood issue. Policemen know enough not to try such atrocities in the more affluent neighborhoods.\n\nI can hardly imagine the plight of the women who have been victims of a crime, and who go to the police station to seek some recourse, where they have to face further humiliation / molestation / injustice. Definitely makes them forget about the original problem in a matter of seconds (sarcasm).\n\n**2. "Do not report burglaries" or "Do not let the police know your economic status".**\nThis is a funny one, especially since its coming from the relatively poor.\n\nWhen our house was burgled and the thief fled with a VCR and stereo (probably the TV was too bulky to run with), we did not call the police. Because bribery is such an integral part of life there, you don\'t want the authorities to know your actual financial status (no matter what it actually is). If they don\'t know your economic status, you can always plead that its worse than what they think - which we always did. But if they see a 25" color TV in the home, you are going to pay through the nose for the rest of your days. And the thief is not going to get caught anyway, and even if he is caught, you won\'t get the stuff back... so no point in calling the police. This is another "common sense" rule of poor localities. Do not report burglaries and don\'t let them see your house on the inside.\n\nOf course, now you might ask, what happens if you catch a burgler in action? It seems that we would have to call the police in order to arrest the thief. Well... this depends on people\'s disposition at that moment. Usually, people will prefer to deal their own brand of justice to the thief and park him in the nearby doctor\'s clinic rather than troubling the police (who would probably have beaten him worse - unless he was able to bribe his way out).\n\n**3. "In the land of the poor, the police are the mafia".**\n\nWhen I was about 15, we used to play cricket in a park, which had a small illegally erected shack on one corner selling tobacco products ( staying in place by paying bribes to the police ). The person running this shack was never happy to see us play there. To this day, I fail to understand the root cause of his resentment - maybe he was just an unhappy person tormented by the system. Every time a ball was hit in the vicinity of his shack, he would give us angry looks, and tell us to go and play somewhere else. If a ball happened to fall harmlessly into his shack, he would make a hue and cry about it, give us dire warnings and we would never see the ball again.\n\nOne day, our ball hit a plastic candy jar kept on the edge of his shop, which fell to the ground. The guy flew into a rage, grabbed one of our bats, broke the stumps and then we all got into a big argument. He called the cops and reported that we had broken things in his shack and roughed him up.\n\nThe cops, ever watchful for such an opportunity, promptly arrested the 3 kids they could get their hands on and took us to the police station. We tried to protest, for which, we got slapped sharply and were told to be quiet unless we wanted more.\n\nAt the police station, we were asked for our names, addresses, phone numbers and parent\'s occupations, which were duly noted down (not an official FIR, but in generic visitor log book). Then we were taken to a room which already had 3 other poor wretched looking men in a rooster (murga) position. We too were then asked to assume a rooster position until the Inspector was ready to deal with us. I now understand that they needed all that info to know how best to make a profit from this situation. From the addresses and parent\'s occupation, the inspector deduced that our parents are too illiterate/ignorant to protest.\n\nThe officer came to the room where we were struggling to maintain the rooster stance. He kicked my friend who was a bit unstable, made him get up and slapped him viciously across the face. He grabbed a large lock of my friend\'s hair and swung him around the room, saying... "You guys want to grow up to become dons... is it? Beating up the shop keeper and destroying his shop. Next, you will be asking for hafta (weekly bribe extracted by mafia).". "No sir. We didn\'t do anything. We were just playing cricket..." Of course, he knew that already. Silly us.\n\nEach of us was slapped around by the inspector, and physically abused in a general manner for the next few minutes. And to further humiliate us, he told us to slap each other. We had no choice... we were forced to do it. He slapped me hard because I didn\'t slap my friend hard enough. And we resumed slapping each other, harder this time, tears streaming down our faces.\n\nIn the meanwhile, they had also called our parents and asked them to come to the police station to deal with the "grave matter". They did not call all the parents at the same time, lest the parents get together and start protesting. They called each parent after they were finished dealing with the previous one. (This is my assumption of their plan - I can\'t be sure if the cops planned it this way, or it just so happened that all the parents happened to arrive at the police station at separate times. From my other experiences with the cops, I believe it was planned.)\n\nOnce each kid\'s parents arrived, they were told that releasing the kids for any amount of money was out of the question. That the police have received a complaint from the shop keeper and the only thing they could do - for an appropriate price -  was to "not beat the kids" while they were in the police station. ( This technically makes sense because what we received is not really a Delhi police beating... they were merely "scolding" us. A beating usually requires hospitalization and  leaves a person bed ridden for days.) They were told that the kids will be taken to a magistrate in 2 days time and the parents should arrange for a lawyer.\n\nOf course, all of this was bullshit but our parents were too stupid to know it (we didn\'t know the law or our rights). This was just to scare the parents to pay whatever they could muster. Our parents pleaded and groveled in front of the police officer to take the money and let the kids go. The matter was finally settled for around 2k per kid, which was a nontrivial amount for our economic state.\n\nThis is not just a solitary incidence - there are tens of other similar horrific incidences endured by people known to me personally. The police are on the lookout for any hint of an activity which they can benefit from. If they can\'t make money from a person because they are too poor, they physically abuse the person for their own entertainment. I am sure every New Delhi resident has seen a poor guy being mistreated by a policeman (being slapped/kicked/beaten in public view). It\'s usually assumed that the poor guy has deserved it and no more thought is given to the matter. You can see how this system can lead to alternative systems of justice like the ones depicted in the movie Sarkar (~Godfather).\n\n\n**4. "You can get slapped by a policeman at any time and for no reason"**. \n\nThere are too many incidences of getting slapped or beaten by policemen to be narrated here in detail. I do remember 2 incidences clearly, which I will describe below...\n\n4a.   This happened when I was about 20. I and a friend were hanging around late at night (11 pm), catching up on each other\'s latest activities as we had been out of touch for more than an year (I had started college and was staying in the hostel, and came back home once every 3 months to visit). We were sitting at our usual get together spot where we used to wait for players to gather before going for playing cricket.\n\nAs we were happily talking away, I noticed a couple of policemen walking towards us. A dread took its grip over my mind, heart and throat. The policeman asked... "Who are you and where do you live?". I took an audible gulp down my throat and answered "Right there Sir.", pointing towards my house. "Go home and talk all you want in your house. I don\'t want to see anyone loitering around here" he ordered.\n\nFortunately and unfortunately, the college scientific education was having an effect on me, where I was taught to not accept things without question. However, I didn\'t realize that I was not in my engineering lab right now. I mumbled "But sir, what has happened to warrant this? We have always spent tim..." BAMM!!! and he slapped me right across the face. "What did I just tell you? Move, else you will receive more."\n\nWhy did the policeman slap me now while we had enjoyed that precise spot for years? I understood this the next day.\nA new computer training shop had opened doors near my house about 6 months ago, and the shop owners had trouble getting girls to sign up for the training lessons. Apparently, some girls had been teased by boys loitering around the shop and the owner had paid the policemen to keep the area clear of loitering boys at all times.\n\n4b.   It is assumed by default that if you are roaming in a better locality than where you belong, you are there for no good reason, or probably to plan a robbery. Incidences like the following one were repeated many times between the age of 10 and 17.\n\nI was walking home from school one late evening after spending time at a friend\'s house. I unfortunately managed to walk into 2 policemen on the way, while I was still in the "better" locality (I liked to walk this way because the houses and the roads were so nice). I am usually on the lookout for policemen while walking around, but this time, they sprung up on me as I rounded a corner. The expression on my face and the fear in my body language immediately gave it away that I was an outsider in this area, feared the police and have been at the receiving end of their abuse on earlier occasions. "I was one of those who feared the police on sight for no reason." I could not even make a run for it, though I did think about it for a second.\n\nThe next scene was played out in a manner similar to how it had already played out many times on earlier occasions... "What\'s your name and where do you live?". I was so stupid and scared that I never thought that I could lie to these guys and slip away. Naah... if they ever came to know I had lied, they would beat me to death and I would have deserved it. Now, I can get away with a few slaps and only getting my hair pulled mercilessly, and promise to never come to this place again. Now that I think of it... I should have kept my hair cut really short - maybe get my ears clipped as well (the cops loved pulling those too) - basically keep all body parts inside the body.\n\n**5. "Authorities take extra advantage of poor/ignorant people".** \n\nAn answer by another Indian for this question claimed that poor Indians face lesser corruption in India (as compared to more affluent ones)... I laughed a little on the outside and cried on the inside. Only if they knew.\n\nWe (family of 5) lived in a very tiny house having only 1 room and a total area of 250 sqft. As we kids grew up, some of us had to sleep on the roof in order to not bump into each other during the night. When it rained, all of us had to fit into the 1 room. Good times - I loved it.\n\nMy father had saved some money (over a period of 15 years) to extend the house, but the building laws and provisions did not allow for any construction/extension at all (at least that is what we were told by the authorities and we were too dumb to read and understand all the laws. The fact that my parents were not fluent in English and Hindi made matters worse. And how can the authorities lie about laws?). They said we needed to file for special permission from the building authority for the new construction. That the  procedure will take about 6 months to complete as the signing authority is extremely busy with other cases.... of course, for X amount of money, it can be done in a few days. Everyone else we knew around us was also equally dumb and was being taken for a similar ride by the authorities (hence, at the time, we didn\'t know for sure that we were being fooled).\n\n\n\nWant to know why the indian justice system is broken? Short answer: Indians.\n\nJustice in India is often delayed. There are many causes for this, but one of the causes is one that has never seen public attention. I\'m going to tell you what this one is.\n\nJudgments of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts are binding on the lower courts and, to a great extent, on the aforementioned courts in the future. More often than not, these judgments are presented to the courts to convince the judges.\n\nUntil 1970, the judgments of both High Courts and the Supreme Court were of adequate length. These judgments were easy to peruse and were on point. I don\'t know what happened, but after 1970, a majority of the judges started writing longer judgments, fluffing them up with completely useless content. Where judgments used to be 5 pages long at most, now most judgments are above 10 pages long. Worse, the average size of judgments is gradually rising. The other day, I read a Supreme Court judgment of 10 pages, of which the first 9 pages had nothing to do with the 10th page, which was the only page that talked about the final order and the reasoning behind said order.\n\nThe consequences of this blatant /r/iamverysmart attitude of the judges of the upper courts are staggering.\n\n-The amount of time they waste on writing such long judgments could have been used on deciding cases.\n\n-They set an example for the lower courts to waste needless time on longer judgments than are necessary.\n\n-Advocates find it much harder to study these judgments and consequently find much lesser time on their hands to prepare for their cases.\n\n-The judges of the lower courts waste a lot of time going through judgments presented by all parties before them, and often get confused due to the staggering length of the judgments.\n\n-The organizations reporting judgments of upper courts find themselves with far too many big judgments to go through, and consequently are unable to produce summaries for most judgments. Even the summaries that they produce are often inaccurate.'<br />Author: 'insaaf_in_india'  id: 'bmk2nr'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bmk2nr/there_is_literally_no_justice_in_india_my_advice/</li>

      <li>Title::: "The Red Hand: India's Affair with Marxism"<br />Body: '# [The Red Hand](https://theemissary.co/the-red-hand/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIndia has always been a land of various ideologies, openness, and tolerance. But what happens when an ideology arrives that ***does not reciprocate this pluralism?***\n\n### First Touch\n\nMarxism is one of the ***most explosive ideologies*** of the 19th and 20th centuries. It\'s history in India begins during Karl Marx\'s life when a few Indian admirers [unsuccessfully tried to organize a chapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_India#cite_note-1) of the First International, a trans-national movement to organize various laborers, trade unions, and communist activists. A German-based Indian even wrote a book on Marx - [*Karl Marx - A Modern Rishi*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Marx_comes_to_India.html?id=kN0NAAAAMAAJ) \\- an ironic label for someone who abhorred religion. \n\nMarxism gained ground in India upon news of the Russian Revolution, as echoes of the Bolshevik\'s support for self-determination rang in India. The British Raj was entering some of its most oppressive phases, so the idea of ***overthrowing vampiric elites*** was very attractive to all Indians, not just Marxist sympathizers. \n\nMarxism influenced various Independence leaders. While the young Bhagat Singh embraced a strident version of Marxism that advocated violent revolution and atheism to achieve its goals; others such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose advocated basic socialist methods to make India rise. In other cases, parties were born that were explicitly Marxist/Communist/Socialist such as the Communist Party of India (CPI) and socialist leaning Ghadar Party. Funny enough the CPI was much more parliamentarian in its approach to independence, while the Ghadar Party advocated violent revolution.\n\nAs independence grew near, the CPI grew more antagonistic towards the Indian National Congress (precursor to modern INC Party), even ***creating a committee called the "***[***League Against Gandhism***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_Against_Gandhism)***"*** because they believed that Gandhi was compromising with the British. The British themselves tried to throttle communist literature and meetings in India but eased their stance during their WW2 alliance with the Soviet Union.\n\n### The Cusp of Revolution\n\nWith Indian Independence, the CPI and communism in general became a chaotic and violent opposition to Nehru\'s socialist INC. The CPI infused an Indian masala to traditional Marxist struggles by ***focusing on caste inequalities (class struggle) and agricultural distress (labor struggle)***. As time went on, the CPI formed the principal opposition in Lok Sabha to the INC in 1952. \n\nThis touch of power ultimately proved to be communism\'s downfall in India. ***Theoretically, India was ripe for revolution.*** Inequalities were staggering, caste was oppressive, and laborers in farms and factories were suffering. But why did it not flourish in this perfect scenario?\n\nThere are a number of reasons.\n\nThe main one can be credited to Jawaharlal Nehru\'s political dispositions. While Nehru made sure India technically stayed non-aligned during the Cold War, he had clear Soviet sympathies due to his passion for socialism. The Soviet Union then made a geopolitical point to preserve a favorable INC government and influenced Communist leaders to tone down their calls for violent revolution.\n\nThe communists would, of course, revolt anyways.\n\n***And here comes the overreach.*** With many communists obeying the USSR, the uprisings were more muted than their terrifying potentials. Small struggles occurred in Kerala and Tripura establishing decent bases for the CPI but nothing with country wide dominance. A much more toxic insurgency would be born in West Bengal, but not before ***another fatal error by certain CPI cadres - treason.***\n\nNehru\'s naïveté was exposed during the 1962 war with China, a war which India would go on to lose. A belligerent China was incensed by India\'s support to Tibet as well as general border disputes. Nehru did not believe China would attack so India\'s defenses were unprepared for the Chinese attack. But what really rubbed salt into the wounds would be the [traitorous support of certain sections of the CPI](http://www.businessworld.in/article/The-Hate-Story-Of-India-And-Marxists/30-11-2015-88800/) to Mao Zedong\'s China.\n\nThis betrayal would fracture the CPI as sections seceded and formed their own party - the Communist Party of India (Marxist) - original...I know. The CPI-M were much more radical and included the sections that supporting China in the 1962 war. \n\n***Now is the moment that communism as an organized political revolution really starts unraveling in India.*** As aforementioned, the CPI-M attempted to revolt in a little town called Naxalbari in West Bengal. The 1967 revolution caught steam, and Mao Zedong supported the smoke. Communism established a strong foothold in Bengal as lower-class tribals rose up against rich upper castes. However this movement would soon splinter due to infighting and external pressure from the Indian state.\n\nA common theme we can see here is the violent tribalism in Indian communism. India itself is extremely tribal; but with Marxism\'s emphasis on division of class, culture, and oppression contests, Indian communist movements seem to eat themselves up and always die with infighting. While communists claimed to fight caste and wealth, rich Brahmins would dominate leadership positions in the parties. \n\nMoreover, Marxism is highly materialistic, and its meditation is constantly on "my fair share." This doesn\'t sit well with the ascetic philosophy of India that trickled down for millennia to the masses. Detachment was supreme. Indian philosophy had summarily defeated and absorbed various foreign ideologies for thousands of years. \n\nMarxism was essentially an extreme Abrahamic faith such as Puritanism or Salafism with its:\n\n* Intolerance for other ideologies\n* Fantastic and unrealistic vision of a future utopia (heaven)\n* Infallible prophet in Karl Marx\n* Fanatical devotion to the establishment of a communist state, it\'s one true God.\n\nMarxism\'s ***devotion to division*** proved too much even for the commonly divided Indian people. Perhaps this is due to this new realization of Indian unity that revolutionaries such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel espoused. The idea of a united India has always been there since ages past. The culmination of a united India may have proved too strong for Communism\'s dividing forces. \n\n### A Creeping Silence\n\nIndira Gandhi, daughter of Nehru, would soon become India\'s most powerful politician while all this communist mayhem was occurring. Indira herself would insert the words ["Socialist" forcefully into the Indian Constitution](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/march-to-socialism-under-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-offers-an-interesting-parallel/articleshow/9715049.cms) during her unlawful Emergency period. She enforced a [***93.5% top marginal tax rate while experiencing dismally low growth rates and 20%+ inflation rates***](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/did-indira-gandhi-impose-emergency-to-escape-economic-crisis-1269992-2018-06-26) overall during her 15 year tenure. This socialist mentality would drag India economically until the IMF mandated liberalization reforms in 1991, where India moved towards a more free market economy and began unleashing its economic potential.\n\nTo form a coalition government, she accepted CPI support. In exchange, CPI Marxists began populating Indian academia, media, and bureaucracy. History books were rewritten, and Indian education was dragged through the dirt with Marxist fantasies and ideals. Much of this Marxist revision would ***eerily resemble colonial tropes.*** Ancient India would be described as backwards, oppressive, and caste obsessed. The horrific crimes of Islamic invasions and British colonialism would be whitewashing and maximum blame was directed towards Hinduism for all of India\'s problems. Millions of Indians would be brought up on this poppycock and whole heartedly believe this ***engineered self-hate.*** Marxists made a point that the ***brown savages of the subcontinent needed to be saved by foreign ideologies*** \\- a mentality that still engulfs the minds of many Indian elites today.\n\nHowever, Indira would be ruthless in eliminating those who challenged her rule and Indian sovereignty. Just as she brutally put down the Khalistan menace, Indira turned her attention to the chaotic Naxal movement. She shattered the movement with [Operation Steeplechase](https://www.gktoday.in/gk/government-of-indias-response-to-naxalism/) where hundreds of Naxals were killed and 20,000 cadre members imprisoned. However, the Naxal movement would silently bleed red across eastern India forming a region now known as the "Red Corridor." This mineral rich region would see Naxals indoctrinating tribals across Chattisgarh, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh to rise up against the Indian state. The movement would become ***increasingly violent and grotesque*** with frequent rapes and murders sparing no man, woman, or child.\n\nAs time went on, Communists would establish strong footholds in Kerala, West Bengal, and Tripura, subsequently destroying all 3 state\'s economies. A stranglehold over their politics would be enforced with violence, booth capturing, and media subservience. The Naxal menace would ferment until the 2000s, when PM Manmohan Singh would finally confront the Naxal cadres with the Indian Army. Ever since then, the Naxal movement became progressively more weak as both Singh and Modi governments decimated the rebels.\n\n### God\'s Own Country\n\nOrganized communism\'s grip on India has progressively faded since the early 2010s. West Bengal\'s CPI-M government fell after decades of rule as Mamata Banerjee\'s TMC would topple their regime. Subsequently, she would prove to outdo their insanities with her own. In Tripura, the BJP defeated another decades old communist regime in 2018. \n\nNow Kerala is where the present situation of Indian communism is strongly personified. \n\nIncreasingly over the years, Indian communism has had a very adversarial relationship with Hinduism. It was fine with and even supported Islam and Christianity in the subcontinent, but communists would loathe Hinduism. This is a fulfillment of cultural Marxism. Seething hatred for the majority religion, culture, and history. Every single Hindu practice and tradition would be seen through the blood tinted lens of oppression and class (caste). ***Nuance and logic were blasphemy to these missionaries of hate.***\n\nBack to Kerala. Kerala has some of the highest Human Development Indices in all of India. Some attribute it to communism\'s equality and development but the shoddy states of West Bengal and Tripura speak otherwise. You see, Kerala has always had a strong ethos of education and social justice especially by the pre-colonial Travancore kingdoms. British missionaries expanded much of this infrastructure to all castes and so did communism. In this way, communists just doubled down on Kerala\'s strengths. In addition, huge amounts of remittances flow into Kerala from Persian Gulf workers.\n\nKerala, known as God\'s Own Country, is extremely diverse religiously and is known for its pluralism:\n\n* Hindus - 55%\n* Muslims - 27%\n* Christians - 18%\n\nBut with this diversity comes the dark side of communism. ***Kerala\'s biggest exports are*** [***ISIS fighters***](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/isis-recruiters-fertile-ground-kerala-indias-tourist-gem) ***and indentured servants/slaves*** in the Gulf. Many of these Gulf Keralans come back indoctrinated by Wahabbi Islamic extremists. Keralan churches have been [frequent sites of sexual](https://qz.com/india/1513007/how-catholic-priests-sexually-abused-nuns-in-kerala-india/) and [financial abuses](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/states/story/20180115-syro-malabar-catholic-church-bank-loan-fr-sebastian-adayanthrath-1122149-2018-01-05). All this occurs under a blind eye, while Keralan Hinduism is mocked and slowly destroyed.\n\nThe land of Adi Shankara, one of the greatest Hindu thinkers and reformers, has witnessed an all out assault on Hinduism from Communists. The CPI has [taken over the Devaswom (Hindu Temple) Board](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/states/story/19990308-ldf-passes-bill-on-election-of-devaswom-board-members-plunges-kerala-into-fresh-round-of-political-and-religious-discord-780369-1999-03-08) and filled it with atheists and Christians. Their attack on Sabrimala has become a lightning rod for Hindus across South India. Even more crass was their [support of atheist activists](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/cm-connived-with-atheist-maoist-groups-to-destroy-sabarimala-bjp-118122300570_1.html) to be some of the first women under 50 allowed into the Sabarimala temple rather than real devotees. They wanted to send a message to Hindus - ***they will not tolerate, but will break their traditions.*** \n\nBut the most sinister aspect of Indian communism doesn\'t manifest in terms of political parties, it takes place in the media and NGOs. \n\n### Urban Naxals\n\nVivek Agnihotri\'s book, [*Urban Naxals*](https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Naxals-Making-Buddha-Traffic-ebook/dp/B07DWC4WXS), catapulted onto the scene in 2018 to much fanfare as well as vitriol. Agnihotri succinctly explained, summarized, and exposed a nexus of NGOs, media, and activists who abet the Naxalite movement in India. Agnihotri coined the term "Urban Naxal" as one who is a part of or sympathetic to this nexus. \n\nThe term caught wildfire as its use spread on mainstream outlets and especially social media. The forces that many people suspected and observed were now aptly labeled and identified. Naming them was half the battle. Now comes the second half of the war.\n\nThese urban Naxals would be found across academia, media, and the bureaucracy. As Indian intelligence caught wind of certain Naxal sympathizers and financiers, [they arrested a number of them.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/five-activists-arrested-for-alleged-naxalite-links-all-you-need-to-know-about-them/articleshow/65588278.cms) This led to further outcry amongst Naxal sympathizers and validation amongst those who campaigned against urban Naxals. \n\nAnother example of Urban Naxal influence was the massive mobilization, support, and supply for the farmer protests and agitations in 2018. While the cause is noble, Indian agriculture has severely suffered from overregulation and government intervention. Indian communists want even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese same Naxal supporters would enter the fray come election time. A few politicians are up for election that some would call Urban Naxals:\n\n* **Kanhaiya Kumar** \\- An infamous student/activist and now CPI member who protested the hanging of convicted terrorist Afzal Guru, who attacked the Indian parliament. He lead a rally where chants of "[*Bharat, tere tukde honge, insha\'allah, insha\'allah*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mpuZ8H_1i4)" (India, we will break you into pieces, God willing, God willing). He along with his fellow JNU radicals Shehla Rashid and Umar Khalid were widely condemned, yet he is still contesting a ticket with wide support from various Bollywood actors and media houses. Would this really fly in any other country?\n* **Atishi Marlena** \\- Named after Marx and Lenin, Atishi was raised in an extreme Marxist household where her parents also defended Afzal Guru and had numerous links with anti-Indian communist parties. She has been recorded saying that people should not hesitate to [vote for goons and criminals](https://swarajyamag.com/insta/aap-leader-atishi-marlena-urges-people-to-vote-for-goons-to-achieve-the-goal-of-defeating-bjp) in order to oust Modi. Marlena trumpeted her achievements as Aam Aadmi Party\'s Delhi Education Minister Advisor, just to have outlets dig into her dubious claims finding various discrepancies, lies, and failures.\n* **Prakash Raj** \\- A former actor and independent candidate who has shown sympathies for AAP and CPI. He has publicly admired the *Tukde Tukde* gang as India\'s next big political movement and voice of the youth. He has campaigned for Kanhaiya and AAP. He shows classic communist mentalities in terms of religion by praising Islam and Christianity versus goading attacks on HInduism. \n\nMarxism has creeped into mainstream parties such as the AAP who increasingly find themselves veering left contrasting with their early moderate days. But even more worrying is its influence on the Congress Party\n\nRahul Gandhi has whole heartedly embraced many aspects of Marxism. He has filled his [advisors with avowed Marxists](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/who-are-the-people-behind-rahul-gandhi-nyay/story/331356.html) reflecting his radically far left economic policies. Large government intervention and sops are perfect vehicles of corruption. Worse still is his [election manifesto promises on Kashmir:](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/nothing-will-be-done-or-allowed-to-change-constitutional-position-on-kashmir-congress-manifesto/articleshow/68689585.cms)\n\n* Army powers and presence are significantly reduced by diluting AFSPA \n* Appeasement for separatists by leaving Article 370 alone\n* Ignoring realities of extremist infiltration by encouraging dialogue with anti-India terrorists\n\nAll this is reinforced by the ***silent cartel of Marxist supporting*** media, NGOs, and activists. Through this Marxist web, various political parties have formed an opposition to Modi. They will go at any length to attack Modi even attacking India itself. Indian communism has morphed into an essentially anti-Indian ideology if not theology. It is an almost exact mirror to early Maoist thought that sought to destroy China\'s glorious past and replace it with a Frankenstein of forced Western ideology.\n\nIt must be said though that socialism is very central to Indian politics. Indira\'s insertion of socialism into the constitution is still keenly felt today. Even the oft described "right-wing" BJP are very left economically (much farther left than American Democrats). If not for Modi\'s policies that many would describe socialist (Ayushman Bharat, Ujjwala, Housing/toilet building projects, etc...), there is a large chance he would never get reelected. Reigning in socialism in India will be a very difficult task, but a second term of Modi may see him returning to his capitalist ways of Gujarat. Perhaps a mixed economy is the best answer, but India still has a ways to veer right.\n\nSo that brings us back to our initial question - Why did communism fail to take root across India when the situation was begging for its revolution?\n\n1. **Jawaharlal Nehru** \\- His embrace of socialism appeased the USSR to restrain communist uprisings. Nehru\'s political acumen constantly tested and frustrated the CPI as well. ***Nehru was a hero of independence who had walked with the Mahatma.*** Not many opposition leaders could go toe to toe with him. It was an almost ideological homeopathy where a milder form (Socialism) of the extreme (Communism) was administered to quell the ultimate disease (Marxism). \n2. **Economic Stagnation** \\- India\'s economy was crushed under excessive government intervention and animosity towards markets that dominated much of Indian economics till the 1991 market liberalization reforms. A sour taste was left in the mouths of many who did not want to consume more extreme versions of the bitter red pill**.** \n3. **Antithesis of Indian Thought**\xa0\\- Marxism became essentially anti-Indian as time went on. The poor just wanted food in their belly, free things, and to stop being oppressed. They didn\'t care for concepts like Brahminical Patriarchy or why their dhoti was fascist. They didn\'t take kindly to their gods being demeaned. ***Marxist materialism could never defeat the ancient and ingrained Indian asceticism.*** The communists had no opportunity to force their ideology on the people like other foreign ideologies did in India. \n\nOverall, India\'s relationship to Marxism, communism, and socialism is ***intensely complex and consequential***. India would not be the India today if not for this triumvirate, for better or for worse. The Red Hand has left its mark on India. Only time will tell if India will accept its embrace again or shatter it.'<br />Author: 'TheEmissaryCo'  id: 'bmez22'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bmez22/the_red_hand_indias_affair_with_marxism/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What are Mahagathbandhan’s chances in UP?'<br />Body: 'With 80 Lok Sabha seats ( 63 General &amp;17 Scheduled Caste seats), Uttar Pradesh is easily the focus of political speculation and observation. Thus, UP holds the keys to the gates of power in Delhi. Come 23 May, the performance of the *Mahagathbandhan*, comprising erstwhile arch rivals Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), may play a deciding role in national politics.\n\nA new [*Economic and Political Weekly*](https://www.epw.in/journal/2019/16/commentary/%E2%80%98development%E2%80%99-and-mahagathbandhan.html)  paper, authored by Manjur Ali of the *Giri Institute of Development Studies (Lucknow)*, analyzed the vote share of all parties that contested in UP in the 2014 elections and highlighted the importance of certain communities for electoral success. \n\nIn particular, the study compared the support base of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with other parties, among the Jatavs, Yadavs, and Muslims, who together account for nearly 50% of the state’s population.\n\nThe author argued that the BJP’s massive victory in the state in 2014, when it won 73 out of the 80 seats, along with its allies, seemed to suggest “development" was more important than caste and religious identities. **However, a unit-level analysis revealed that in Muslim-dominated constituencies, the BJP was not the most preferred party and it got an edge only because the votes were split between the BSP and the SP.** \n\n* The study found the combined vote share of the *Mahagathbandhan* in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections would have been 43%, compared with the 42.6% of the BJP. However, votes may not be easily transferred between the SP and the BSP.\n* The author argued that in the absence of preferred candidates, both the Yadavs and the Jatavs preferred the BJP. \n* In the case of Muslim candidates, the BJP becomes the first choice for both groups. He argued that the *Mahagathbandhan* will only be able to rely on Muslims for consistent support.\n* The author said that in the triangular fight among the SP-BSP combine, the Congress and the BJP, the BJP still has a chance to win the maximum number of seats this time in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Source:**  [What are Mahagathbandhan’s chances in UP? | Livemint](https://www.livemint.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections/what-are-the-mahagathbandhan-s-chances-in-up-1557209993185.html)'<br />Author: 'RevenantPanda'  id: 'bmbzfu'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bmbzfu/what_are_mahagathbandhans_chances_in_up/</li>

अगर उन सज्जन ने अपनी मादरी ज़बान हिंदवी में कहा\nहोता "भाईसाहब रुकावट के लिए खेद है", तो हम भी उनसे एकदम\nसहज होकर बात करते, और पूछते "यहाँ कोई कायदा कानून है कि\nनहीं, आप अपने अधिकारी को बुलाइये, आपकी शिकायत\nपुस्तिका कहाँ है, आप पहले अपना पूरा नाम बताइये"। इस पूरी\nखातिरदारी के बीच यह भी बता दिया जाता कि मेरा एक\nदूर का भाई भी आई ए एस अधिकारी है। लेकिन ऐसा हो न सका,\nक्योंकि उस भद्र पुरुष ने अंग्रेज़ी में बोल दिया था "sir kindly bear\nwith us, please wait for a minute"। \nअब ऐसे में जब आपके होंठों पर\nसौम्य मुस्कान तैर रही है, तो आप केवल मीठी मुस्कान से आभार\nप्रकट कर सकते है। लेकिन आप इस पूरे प्रकरण में दूसरी लाइन की गति\nपर किसी मुख्य चुनाव आयुक्त की भांति नज़र बनाये रखते है।\nअपनी वाक्पटुता और चतुराई पर तब गर्व होता है, जब आप देखते है\nकि बगल वाली लाइन में पूरा पाकिस्तान बना हुआ है और पूरा\nकुनबा मिल कर भी छोटे का आधार कार्ड नहीं ढूंढ पा रहे।\nइस पूरे कर्मकांड से निजात पाकर आप बढ़ते है आगे सी आई एस एफ के\nजवान आपका इंतेज़ार कर रहे होते है। इन जवानों को दुआ सलाम\nकरके आप आगे बढ़ते हैं, तो एक अलग ही दुनिया है।\n\n\nआपको जान कर चमचमाती झक्क सफेद दूधिया रोशनी में नहाई\nदूकानों के बीच से गुज़र कर वेटिंग एरिया तक जाना होता है। इन\nदुकानों पर जो सामान होता है, होता तो बहुत अच्छा है,\nलेकिन आप अपने होठों में बुदबुदाते हैं, की इस सामान को\nखरीदता कौन होगा? तीन तीन हज़ार के उस्तरे, पंद्रह सौ की\nकमर पेटी। लेकिन आप फिर भी विंडो शॉपिंग करते करते अपना\nखुद का आंकलन कर रहे होते हैं। दिमाग में एक कैलकुलेटर चल रहा\nहोता है, जिसमें आप अपने पहने हुए परिधानों के मूल्य का गुणा\nभाग कर रहे होते हैं। अब ऐसे में गली के जैगम को कहां ध्यान रहेगा\nखाने के स्वाद का!\n\nयहाँ से आगे गोलाई लेते हुए बड़े से बरामदे के बायीं तरफ होती है एक\nदुकान, सामाजिक बुराई की दुकान। इस दुकान की रौनक तो कुछ\nऔर ही होती है। यहाँ पर बड़ा सा बोर्ड लगा होता है, कुछ टैक्स\nऔर ड्यूटी की बात होती है। लिखा होता है ड्यूटी फ्री।\nआपकी रुचि इस दुकान पर बहुत बढ़ जाती है, क्योंकि बाकी\nदुकानों की अपेक्षा यहाँ सबसे ज़्यादा भीड़ होती है। नज़दीक\nजाने पर आपको समझ आता है, की यहाँ भी मामला अपनी जेब के\nबाहर का है। थोड़ा आगे बढ़ते ही आपको एक बुद्धत्व से प्रतीत\nहोता है। अब आप एक किताबों की दुकान के सामने खड़े हैं। इस\nदुकान में कई ऐनक लगाए लेखक फर्मे के लोग दिखाई देते हैं।अब यहां\nभी मामला अंग्रेज़ी में चल रहा होता है। आप जब किताबों के\nबीच चेतन भगत की किताब ढूंढ रहे होते है, तभी यह लेखकनुमा\nभाईसाहब दुकानदार से ऐसी किताब की डिमांड करते हैं,\nजिसका आपने नाम भी नहीं सुना कभी। दूसरा झटका लगता है,\nजब दुकानदार की आवाज़ आपके कानों से टकराती है, जब वह उन\nलेखक महाशय को बताता है, की साहब वह किताब तो बेस्टसेलर\nहै, टोटल आउट ऑफ स्टॉक।तब आप दोबारा अपना आँकलन करते है,\nऔर याद आता है, कि पिछली किताब जो आपने पूरे चाव से पढ़ी\nथी वह थी, कक्षा सात की "किशोर भारती"। एक बार फिर\nज़लालत की एक छोटी से कैप्सूल लेकर आप आगे बढ़ जाते हैं। अब ऐसे में\nगली के जैगम को कहां ध्यान रहेगा खाने के स्वाद का!\n\nइस पूरे सफर में आपका पेट suffer कर रहा होता है। इसकी वजह\nहोती है , फ़ूड कोर्ट से उड़ती हुई खुशबू। आगे बढ़ने पर आपको सूचित\nहोता है, की एक समोसा चालीस रुपये का है। आपको तब याद\nआता है पार्क के पास वाले सिंधी के ताज़े समोसे। जिसका\nअधिकतम खुदरा मूल्य दस रुपये है, और सीधे कढ़ाई से उतरते गर्मा\nगरम।सुबह तीन बजे उठने के कारण आपको हल्का भूख का एहसास तो\nहो रहा है, लेकिन मन लगा होता है प्रभु सुमिरन में। प्रभु सुमिरन\nक्योंकि आप आज सुबह खुल कर नहीं निबट पाए। आपको रह रह कर\nआपके उदर से मिस कॉल आ रही है। ऐसे में आपको समझ नहीं आ रहा\nकि पहले खाएं की निबटाएँ। इसी उधेड़ बुन में आप प्रसाधन कक्ष\nकी तरफ बढ़ते हैं तो एक और राष्ट्रीय समस्या आ घेरती है। मैं\nनिबटने चला तो जाऊं, लेकिन सामान किसके पास छोड़ें। आस\nपास कोई भी अपरोचेबल नहीं लगता। जो थोड़ा बहुत आपकी\nतरफ देख रहा है, उसने कानों पर बड़े से लाउडस्पीकरनुमा इयरफोन\nहैं। यहां पर आप अपने अरमान दबाये वापस अपनी सीट पर आ बैठते है।\nखाने और निबटाने की जद्दोजहद के बीच आपको याद आती है\nपूड़ी-अचार की, जो आपकी मम्मी ने लड़ झगड़ कर बैग में रखवाई\nथी। लेकिन यहां फिर आप सोचने लगते हैं, यहां एल्युमीनियम\nफॉयल में लिपटी हुई पूड़ी खोली तो कोई क्या सोचेगा (पचास\nकी उम्र पार करने पर समझ आता है, घंटा किसी को कोई फर्क\nनहीं पड़ता)। बहरहाल इस खाने और निबटाने की पसोपेश में\nहवाईअड्डे के पब्लिक अनाउंसमेंट सिस्टम पर आपकी फ्लाइट की\nघोषणा हो जाती है। अब आप ही बताइए, अब ऐसे में गली के जैगम\nको कहां ध्यान रहेगा खाने के स्वाद का!\n\n\nअब जैसे तैसे आप पच्चीस दरवाज़े पार करके पहुँचते हैं अपनी सीट पर।\nमन फिर लग जाता है प्रभु सुमिरन में। एक सच्चे भारतीय की\nभाँति आप दुआ कर रहे होते हैं कि कोई एक बॉलीवुड अभिनेत्री\nआपकी बगल की सीट पर बैठ जाये। इस कल्पना को आप यह सोच\nकर पूरा करते हैं, की वह आपसे पूरे रास्ते बात करती जाए और जाते\nजाते आप दोनों में मोबाइल नंबर का भी आदान प्रदान हो जाये।\nलेकिन, होय वही जो राम रची राखा। आपकी बगल में आ बैठता\nहै, चांदनी चौक का लौंग-इलाइची का एक बड़ा आढ़ती। वह आपसे\nबात तो करना चाहता है, लेकिन अब आप स्वयं को भद्र पुरुष\nदिखाने की होड़ में लग जाते है। यहां तक कि सीट की जेब में रखी\nइश्तहारी पत्रिका के सभी पन्ने पढ़ जाते है। \nइस दौरान विमान\nपरिचायिका आपको सीट पेटी बंधने का एक छोटा सा शो\nदिखाती है। आप कौतूहलवश उस लड़की को देख रहे होते हैं, की\nइसको देख कर मुझे हँसी आ रही है, इसने अपनी हँसी कैसे रोक रखी\nहै। लेकिन काम तो काम है। इन लड़के लड़कियों के लिए मेरे मन में\nबहुत आदर है। प्लेन के हवा में आते आते आप हल्के नींद के आगोश में आ चुके\nहोते है। ऐसे में आधी नींद में आपको कोई भी कुछ खाने को देगा\nतो आपको क्या स्वाद आएगा। अब बताइये, अब ऐसे में गली के जैगम\nको कहां ध्यान रहेगा खाने के स्वाद का!'<br />Author: 'Sonam-guptaa'  id: 'bm4oxs'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bm4oxs/ऐर_पलन_क_खन_बसवद_कय_हत_ह_खफनक_सच_hindi_tldr/</li>

It’s less than 1% bioavailable, and its half-life under physiological conditions is measured in minutes. This makes a person wonder how it can be such a wonder drug. The authors of the current paper, indeed, state that “To our knowledge, (it) has never been shown to be conclusively effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for any indication“*\n\n*The paper cites a long list of references demonstrating that curcumin  participates in pretty much every undesirable behavior possible in an  assay: it reacts with proteins, it’s a redox cycler, it coordinates  metal ions, it aggregates, it disrupts membranes nonspecifically, it  interferes with fluorescent readouts, and it decomposes. Other than  that, it’s a perfectly good hit.*\n\n*Coordinating metal ions means that when you test curcumin in the  presence of metal ions, you might be seeing the effect of the metal ions  in the assay rather than the effect of curcumin (for example,* [*http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/01/08/metal\\_impurities\\_will\\_waste\\_your\\_time*](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/01/08/metal_impurities_will_waste_your_time)*).  In that case, you would be seeing something as a hit that really isn’t.*\n\n*Another complication is when an enzyme in an assay needs a metal  cofactor, like magnesium, and the drug substance is yanking it away. You  see a deactivated enzyme and think “Aha! I have an inhibitor compound!”  when all you have is a metal chelator.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Everything you need to know about Curcumin can be summed up as follows: “Bharat Aggarwal published lots of papers on it”.*\n\n*Google is your friend, if you don’t already know why he’s (in)famous.  Unfortunately, the myth of curcumin lives on in part because the US  Office of Research Integrity has yet to release findings of an  investigation into Aggarwal, after more than 4 years. When (if) they do,  I don’t imagine the effects on those promoting curcumin will be  positive.*'<br />Author: 'veekm'  id: 'blpsmg'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/blpsmg/curcumin_will_waste_your_time/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'BJP Bhakt'<br />Body: 'The BJP Bhakt is more dangerous than the BJP itself. He uses the BJP to channelise his hate, insecurities, and biases against the minorities, political parties and all those who he disagrees with. In BJP he has found a voice which he had lost for 700 years.\n\nHe hates Muslims, he hates Christians, he hates liberals, and sickulars, he hates Congress, he hates SP, BSP, TMC, and every other party leader. He hates Arvind Kejriwal. He hates NDTV and India Today. He hates Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. \n\nHe doubts the intentions of every good man in the country based on his religion. He believes Aamir Khan, Naseeruddin Shah, Javed Akhtar, Shahrukh Khan are traitors. When Aamir\'s wife wanted to migrate, he made it a national issue. But when he learns that Akshay Kumar has silently migrated 7 years ago, he justifies his actions.  \n\nHe cannot laugh at jokes made on Modi. He will call the CM of Delhi as Khujliwal or Rahul Gandhi as Pappu, but he can\'t tolerate Kunal Kamra joking on Modi. All jokes have to stop when it comes to Narendra Modi. \n\nHe is educated, but flushes down his brain cells when it comes to sharing fake news against those he dislikes. He does not care that it is fake. He wants to share it nevertheless. The more fake news he shares, the better he sleeps at night.\n\nIn 2014, he believed that the Hindus were under threat. So he voted for Modi. Five years, 22 states and 300+ seats later, he still believes that Hindus are under threat. When asked what is he scared of, he will point fingers at the suicide attacks in Sri Lanka. When told that there has not been a single suicide attack in India (except Kashmir) in the past five years, he will change the topic.\n\nHe is a Master of Whataboutery. For everything that BJP does which goes against his values, he positions his arguments with a long list of Whatabouteries. \n\nThis is his typical formula: \n\nMuslims did this for 700 years + Nehru did that in 1955 + Congress did this in 1982 = BJP is Right. \n\nBJP is always right.\n\nHe is a bundle of contradictions. He promotes Demonetisation as the need of the hour, but does not mind dealing in cash himself. He pays bribes to traffic cops and donations for school and college admissions. He sits for long hours with his CA to see where he can trick the IT department on taxes. He even pees on the roadside without waiting for a Swacch Bharat toilet. And he has the audacity to write Chowkidar before his name.\n\nHe wants a Bullet Train in which he cannot afford to travel. He wants the world\'s tallest statue of a Congressman called Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel because Modi decided so. He will even justify the statue of Ram in UP, but he will not ask Modi why he couldn\'t build a single statue of Veer Savarkar in the past 5 years. \n\nHe loves the national flag and the national anthem. But he cannot sing it when asked. He wants Muslims to say Vande Mataram, but he does not understand a word of it himself. \n\nHe is a Hindu who has not read the Upanishad. His understanding of Hinduism is through WhatsApp messages. He thinks God exists in the heaven and therefore Ram Mandir is necessary, and Sabarimala will curse Kerala for letting women in. \n\nHis icons are those who support Narendra Modi. In Bollywood, his yardstick is not acting but political views of the actors and directors. So Vivek Agnihotri is a rockstar. He supports Akshay Kumar winning a national award for Rustom over Aamir in Dangal and Manoj Bajpayee in Aligarh. He trashes a movie like Grand Masti for going against Indian values, but Vivek Oberoi becomes his new icon because he is playing Narendra Modi in his biopic. \n\nThe BJP Bhakt is a follower at heart. He belongs to the industrial era. He uses the internet, but does not agree with the foundations of the internet economy. He loves discipline, orders and compliance. He wants to be lead. He does not like questions about his political icons. But he loves questioning everyone he detests.\n\nHe does not like to debate. He knows his icons are wrong. But he keeps justifying their wrongs. When he is unable to win a debate, he uses foul language. He gets personal. He calls names. \n\nHe refuses to speak against crimes committed by radical Hindus in the name of religion. He is happy to see innocent Muslims in India pay for the sins of ISIS across the world. He will never thank them for the grace they have shown despite being repeatedly reviled in the past 5 years. \n\nHe is more communal than the BJP. He is more dangerous than the BJP. He thinks he is in the majority because BJP has 300+ seats in the Parliament. He doesn\'t care of the constitutional values. He is a Frankenstein created by the BJP. His hate will override BJP\'s development agenda. I hope it happens soon than later, so that Narendra Modi can focus on what he has been voted for in the first place. \n\nLook at this joker squirting milk on "Modiji". In the past 5 years, BJP has made me realise that there are millions like him in my country. In an internet economy, this is a telling image that represents India of the 21st century. \n\n#bjpbhakt #bjp'<br />Author: 'awsiamavilable'  id: 'blp8v5'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/blp8v5/bjp_bhakt/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Review: Made in Heaven an Amazon Prime Video'<br />Body: '**Title:** Made in Heaven\n\n**Producer:** Excel Entertainment and Amazon Prime Video\n\n**Starring:** Arjun Mathur, Kalki Koechlin, Jim Sarbh, Shivani Raghuvanshi, and others\n\n**Writers:** Zoya Akhtar, Alankrita Shrivastava, and Reema Kagti\n\n**Directors:** Zoya Akhtar, Alankrita Shrivastava, Nitya Mehra, Prashant Nair\n\n**Premier date:** March 8, 2019\n\nSince it\'s a web series, there\'s no certification, but I\'d think it would be either UA or A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince Amazon came to India, they\'ve been looking to create more local content for their Prime Video subscription service. *Made in Heaven* is one such offering - a critique into the world of the Big Fat Indian Wedding, it also explores several political and social issues. The story revolves around Karan and Tara, two friends that have a wedding planning business of the same name as the show. However, they\'re a high-end wedding planner, sticking to the ultra-rich and famous despite having a fairly modest team. \n\nThat\'s the main story - each episode is about a wedding they plan, the drama in each, and generally has some sort of message. There are the parents that insist that the bride must be "pure" (wink, wink), the groom that can\'t keep out of other women\'s beds, the parents who can\'t afford a lavish wedding but want one, the parents that expect a big dowry even if they don\'t ask for it... you get the idea. There\'s also the stories behind the characters themselves: Tara married her way from poverty into riches but isn\'t happy with how things have worked out, while Karan is gay when Article 377 IPC was still around. \n\nOn their own, the stories are interesting, although not particularly relatable for a mass audience. The fact that the super-rich are pretty unhappy is urban legend by now, and this show just highlights that creatively. A lot of the acting and characters are good in the beginning, but towards the end, the storyline becomes so preachy that it is not appealing anymore. Karan\'s gay character is depicted well - none of the stereotype that Bollywood tends to have about effeminate gay men - but the issue itself is handled badly. Of course, the writers brought in the BJP (without naming it) and painted the Hindu RW as anti-gay, and anti-anything good in general. No points for guessing how they handled other religious groups, especially those that actually supported 377 in court. Also, Kalki Koechlin continues her own typecasting by once again choosing a negative role as a typical home-breaker. When she started her career in *Dev D*, she had a lot of potential, but now she\'s just an also-ran.\n\nOverall, IMO the show starts off well and has an interesting premise, but eventually just becomes a political commentary, another propaganda piece in short. It was never relatable at a social level for the middle class anyway, and was presumably made with a western/NRI audience in mind (the amount of sex and skin goes to show just that). If you already have Prime, you might watch the first few episodes, but otherwise don\'t bother. I doubt this will ever make it to TV.'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'blhyga'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/blhyga/review_made_in_heaven_an_amazon_prime_video/</li>

Then like everyone, I grew up and the more I think about it, the more I feel that it was a bunch of horseshit. Being diverse has been the biggest hurdle, because our ego is too big to see the bigger picture. \n\nIf you ask Muslims to become more moderate and progressive, the counterargument would be what about Hindus and their caste system, why aren't you asking them to be progressive.  Are we ever going to stop this whataboutism and sincerely look at our problems as they are.\n\nRecent example, someone demands to ban burqa, and someone argues what about veil.

I don't know the language great now I am afraid to board the auto rickshaw in my own goddamn country. \n\nIf we are to ever solve the problems associated with religion still we will be in the same mess.

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Thai King, elections in South Africa, and the Chinese Civil War (long post)'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Biweekly Geopolitics Thread! In the midst of hectic election campaigning and the damage from Cyclone Fani, let\'s take a moment out to see what else has been happening in the world. Discussion can be on any topic from anywhere in the world, and it does not have to be related to India. Here are some interesting news items to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s Neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Pak opposition alleges that IMF has taken over the country](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-04/pakistan-names-imf-economist-as-central-bank-head-amid-bailout)\n\nAs an IMF team is in Islamabad to discuss Pakistan\'s bailout, Prime Minister Imran Khan made an extraordinary change in the government: the incumbent chiefs of the country\'s central bank and federal taxation authority were fired, and then he appointed IMF economist Reza Baqir as chief of the central bank. This comes in addition to the previous firing of finance minister Asad Umar. The opposition PPP and PML(N) have disparaged the government for appointing several technocrats associated with the IMF, saying that Khan is handing over the country to the IMF and one senator even likening the IMF to the East India Company! Meanwhile, headline inflation in Pakistan reached 8.8%, even as the IMF team wants the country to devalue the currency and allow a free float, which would exacerbate inflation further.\n\n2. [New Thai King crowned days after fourth marriage](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-king-coronation/thailand-to-crown-its-newlywed-king-in-elaborate-ceremonies-idUKKCN1S924J)\n\nThailand crowned their new king, Maha Vajiralongkorn, in an opulent and highly religious ceremony, after his father and former king Bhumibol Adulyadej passed away in 2016. The country has since been in an extended period of mourning, which ended only now. The new king will reign under the title of Rama X, as Thai kings of the current dynasty have assumed the title of Rama. Just three days before the coronation, the king married his bodyguard, now Queen Suthida, in the fourth marriage for the 64th year old (he has divorced thrice). Following his coronation, the King is now a "Devaraja" or divine king, to be considered a god in the country and protector of Buddhism. \n\n3. [US ends all Iranian sanction waivers](https://www.apnews.com/38aca37557e240d08b6c52f0c37aeef8)\n\nThe US terminated sanction waivers to Iran\'s top oil importers - China, India, Turkey, Japan, and S Korea - in a bid to bring down the country\'s oil exports to zero. Iran\'s economy is already in a crisis, with high inflation and a shrinking GDP. These are unilateral sanctions that would cut off entities buying Iranian oil from the American banking system that underpins global trade, which could be catastrophic for any country. To pick up the slack in supply, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the US itself have increased supply recently. However, several countries condemned the move, with Turkey\'s foreign minister doing so publicly. Even the EU condemned the unilateral move in a joint statement, but no Euro-denominated alternative payments mechanism has been agreed upon yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stores from the world:\n\n1. [North Korea resumes missile tests amidst famine fears](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/05/asia/north-korea-weapons-test-intl/index.html)\n\nFor the first time since late 2017, N Korea tested missile systems in its eastern seaboard, although none of the tests came near Japan or South Korea. President Donald Trump, who has met dictator Kim Jong-Un twice so far, has touted the absence of any missile tests as proof of the success of his approach (and not-so-subtle hints that he should get a Nobel Peace Prize). These tests come as the countries have reached an impasse, although Trump reiterated his belief that Kim would ultimately listen to reason and denuclearize. Simultaneously, the UN [says](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48150205) that a combination of extreme weather and economic hardship has led to widespread crop failures in the country, creating a risk of a famine. \n\n2. [Possible failed coup in Venezuela](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-uprising-juan-guaido-calls-protests-nicolas-maduro-remains-today-2019-05-01/)\n\nVenezuela\'s internationally-recognized President Juan Guaido attempted to create a coup in the country by asking the military to defect and rise against the actual President Nicolas Maduro, in the so-called "Operation Freedom" that received support from the US President and Secretary of State. However, although the attempt led to widespread protests, it appears to have failed, with no major member of the military defecting, appearing instead with Maduro in a national TV broadcast. The US has blamed Russia and Cuba for propping up Maduro\'s socialist regime, and has demanded that Russian troops leave the country and the Western Hemisphere. \n\n3. [South Africa set for national elections](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/05/720376200/south-africa-elections-will-the-governing-african-national-congress-hold-power)\n\nSouth Africa\'s ruling African National Congress (ANC) will try to get another mandate to rule the country on May 8, extending its uninterrupted rule since the end of Apartheid 25 years ago. While everybody expects the ANC to win on the back of support from majority Black South Africans, anger against the party is rising, particularly against the corruption of former President Jacob Zuma (who was replaced by the ANC last year) and the extremely influential Gupta Family that have significant business interests and control over the ANC. Furthermore, after Nelson Mandela\'s death, younger voters wonder if it\'s time to move on from the glory of toppling Apartheid and vote on bread and butter issues, such as the economy and jobs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Chinese Civil War\n\n*(This will be a long post but I hope you enjoy it! IMO, China\'s history is barely covered in Indian textbooks, whereas they are our principal geopolitical threat, so we should know more about them.)*\n\nChina is, arguably, a unified and strong country today, well on its way to becoming a superpower and even the sole superpower of Asia. However, it was just a hundred years ago when China was but a mere rump state with three unofficial capital cities controlled by three different factions, and many more smaller warlords. The Chinese Civil War, which lasted over a quarter of a century, shaped the creation of the modern People\'s Republic of China. And although it was a war fought among different groups in China, it too was part of the Soviet-US rivalry. \n\nIn the early 1800s, China was the richest country in the world, ruled by the powerful **Qing Dynasty**. However, the Qing was a highly conservative and traditional court that refused to change the country as the world around it changed. In a span of about 75 years, China was defeated in the **First and Second Opium Wars** against Western countries (including the British in India), and in the **First Sino-Japanese War** of 1895, which led to a number of territorial concessions (including ceding Formosa Island/Taiwan to Japan, its first colony). And although American intervention prevented an India-style colonial takeover of China, the Qing effectively ruled in name only. \n\nFollowing the defeat in 1895, a number of revolutionary groups came up with the aim of overthrowing the weak Qing dynasty. In 1911, **Sun Yat-Sen** led the newly formed Chinese Nationalist Party (**Kuomintang, or KMT**) to overthrow the Qing and establish the **Republic of China** in the Xinhai Revolution, based in the city of **Nanjing**. However, the KMT\'s control over the country was weak, and warlords left over from the imperial regime continued to exercise local control, loosely aligning themselves around the remnants of Qing strongman **Yuan Shikai** in the old capital of **Beijing**. After much intrigue, Beijing became the capital of a weak unified government. \n\nThe next stage of this chaos came in 1921. By then, World War I had ended and with it came a new revolutionary state: **the Soviet Union**. Having been sucked dry by foreign powers to fund WWI, Sun Yat-Sen turned to the Soviets for aid and support to further unify his shaky Republic. The Soviets did him one over: they supported him, but also created the **Communist Party of China (CPC)**, and insisted that the KMT and CPC work together. The key actor here was **Chiang Kai-shek**, a KMT general who eventually took over the party (at that time, both the KMT and the CPC has their own private armies that fought each other in minor skirmishes; the CPC still has its private army today, the PLA). Throughout this time, the Soviets gave money and support to the CPC.\n\nBy 1927, when Kai-shek took over the KMT, the party has split into a left-wing group that allied with the CPC, and a right-wing group that opposed them. Eventually, the KMT expelled and even killed its left-wing members as it decided to militarily confront the CPC. And thus began the first phase of the Chinese Civil War, which the CPC fought by creating its Red Army, the precursor to the modern PLA. In this phase, the KMT scored major victories but were unable to dislodge the CPC, by then led by Mao Zedong, from their base in southern China. It was only in 1934 that KMT forces stormed southern China, forcing Mao and his men to flee through the western mountains in what is known as the Long March, a successful, 12,500 km long retreat that let the weakened CPC live to fight another day.\n\nThe first phase of the Civil War ended in 1937, when the Japanese launched a massive invasion of China and annexed Manchuria in the northeast, in what is known as the **Second Sino-Japanese War** but was part of **World War II**. Through mediation by both the Soviets and the Americans, the KMT and CPC reluctantly joined forces to fight the Japanese, although the KMT bore the brunt of the actual fighting, with CPC fighters choosing low-intensity guerrilla tactics instead. Even during this time, the KMT and CPC continued to fight for eventual control of all of China. Then, in 1945, America dropped two nuclear warheads on Japan, leading to their unconditional surrender. And thus, freed from a common enemy, the second and last phase of the Chinese Civil War began. \n\nOne can argue that the KMT was so weakened fighting the Japanese that it had no chance against the CPC\'s Red Army. But this is not entirely true: the KMT still had modern weapons, which the CPC lacked. The turning point was **Manchuria**, where neither the KMT nor the CPC had any control. There, the 700,000-strong Japanese Kwantung Army surrendered to the Soviet Army, leaving behind their modern armaments. Despite protests from the KMT and Washington, Stalin ordered Marshal Malinovsky to hand over most of the weapons to the CPC. At the same time, the CPC promised extensive land reforms that won over the local population (ironically the modern PRC does not allow individual ownership of land), which in turn caused many well-trained KMT troops to defect. The balance in China had suddenly shifted in Mao\'s favour. \n\nBy 1949, the CPC\'s Red Army had killed over a million KMT troops and, on April 23, captured the KMT\'s capital in Nanjing. The KMT was on the retreat, and by December, they would be pushed to Taiwan, where they held on to the island with the help of American forces (who, incidentally, only helped them after the Korean War broke out in 1950). On Oct 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the **People\'s Republic of China**, and by mid-1950, the CPC gained full control of all of China (including Tibet, which was the last holdout), except Taiwan. Subsequent efforts to retake Taiwan have failed, but the clock may be ticking on the self-governing island\'s future as China continues its ascent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'I posted this on Cancer sub and as expected it was removed. Read it.'<br />Body: 'Yesterday I was watching an interaction of a supreme court lawyer with Ashoka University students and this is what I have observed over a period of time which I wish to put forward. Ashoka University is far left or the students who were present their were far left but if you are part of the ecosystem, that far left too is justified. What bad it brings is never discussed because ecosystem doesn\'t have a place for discussion and that will eventually be the reason for downfall of left in India and nobody can do anything about it unless they change their ways drastically.\n\n1. **It\'s okay to Punch up and not okay to punch down** this was the view of one of the students, and he didn\'t expect the response which he gotback..."*so who do you think we should blame for caste oppression? Brahmins are just 4%. Should they be allowed to oppress 35% dalits and OBCs because it\'s okay to punch up but Dalits and OBCs must not say something against it*". The point is the ridiculousness of the argument which was put forward, no wonder they couldn\'t handle it and left the room.\n2. **Inability to handle criticism:** This sub is an example of that, and other ecosystem which goes beyond this sub is Bollywood..their systematic vilifying of movie **\'The Tashkent Files\',** that they either refused to review it or gave it zero &amp; 0.5 stars... now the result is that Movie is a hit by just the word of mouth. This sub also has silenced 10s of thousands of people for having different opinion these kind of things will eventually lead to the downfall of left....it\'s already largely irrelevant now. I won\'t be surprised if this post is similarly deleted and I\'m blocked or just ignored for stating truth because that isn\'t the forte of this sub.\n3. **Loyalty to India:** Since it\'s initial times itself Indian left has been working against the interest of India, be it active sabotage of Quit India Movement or actively vilifying Subhash Chandra Bose terming him as fifth columnist and a puppet of Japan because Indian communists were worried about their Fatherland. Irony today is that they have found a new hero in Arun Shourie who wrote and exposed the nexus of Indian communists, leftists and British with whom they had aligned to defend USSR. Same thing happened in 1962 war and it\'s happening even today. For few crumbs, Indian left sucks upto goras in west to demonize India and contributes a lot in generation of atrocity literature. The moment they decide to think for themselves, they will be thrown out of the gate.\n4. **Quick in giving labels:** This is something comes from communist manifesto itself and was argued by the man himself that before arguing with anyone of your opposite ideology, remember your only aim is conversion. Giving labels is first step, then if you wish and think you are in a position to analyze, then analyze his merit. If above mentioned things do not work, there is always the good old **\'Character assassination\'.**\n5. **Icons:** Indian left of 2019 is so detached from reality is that it thinks in a world which is hyper-connected, and everything is available just on a click of a mouse, they can manage it in good old ways where 5 people who were favorite of Nehru used to decide what the rest of the country will read. None of these \'intellectuals\' ever appear for a debate in their life. Amartya Sen, Arundhati Roy, Romila Thapar. In fact few people who are challenging the history books in Supreme court now, have already contacted Romila Thapar to come on a public stage and debate it. She didn\'t, so they went ahead and now they are making a new education policy altogether. So lack of scrutiny makes mediocrity look elite and thus bringing down the quality of debate, discourse everything. Compare that to Right...Nilesh Oak wrote two or three books dating Mahabharat &amp; Ramayan and the Right itself is critiquing that  work actively even after the fact that the rest of the people who have already worked on it from left  haven\'t debunked any of the work done by him.\n6. **Ambedkar:** Admit it, you have lost him too as an icon and now Right is actively pushing Ambedkar because however uncomfortable, they accept his criticism of caste, that gives them a leverage on using Ambedkar\'s views on Islam, Pakistan &amp; Christianity. Good luck taking it back. What left did was selectively use Ambedkar to target Brahmins and hide rest of it because it\'s okay to punch up and not okay to punch down.\n7. Today situation is so dire politically that Raj Thakrey, Yashwant Sinha &amp; Arun Shourie are new darling of left, imagine that situation. Media establishment has been successfully challenged &amp; toppled in English by Republic, in online too, there is  a drastic change and challenge being presented by right, only section which remains is print and situation of The Hindu if anybody is here from Banglore and Andhra can confirm is not very well either.  Bollywood in 2014 was unanimously in opposition of Modi and now there is a clear divide and it\'s not going to end very well for left.\n8. Somebody asked in this sub, \'**is being Right the new cool?**\' It might be. but the thing is that in a closed system, you can hide your demerits and show only that what you think will portray you in a good light. But the system which got its voice because of hyper connectivity and establishment was always opposed to it, you think people can\'t see through it? The rise of right is more sophisticated and is going to stay in the long run, unless Indian left mends its ways and presents the better alternative. Of course if the only aim of the left is to win one Begusarai seat and somehow manage seats in Kerala, some universities and this sub...then it\'s fine the way they are going.\n9. You have right to your opinions but you don\'t have right to your facts, Facts can\'t be changed. Let thousand ideas flourish around it. The most sophisticated ones will automatically survive and most stupid ones will die. Indian left instead of competing believes in vilifying and making conspiracy theories that why Right is becoming popular! Because the celebrated Amartya Sen\'s work which is \'The Argumentative Indian\' doesn\'t stand the scrutiny of time and if anybody reads the book in 2019, he can\'t help but realize what a load of trash it is. But if you are sitting and dining among leftists, they can\'t stop boasting about it that they have read Amartya Sen\'s book. Mediocrity is celebrated in left and not critiqued. Recent example of that is Audrey Truchske who has become left\'s new favorite because she is on a mission to whitewash the crimes of Aurangzeb.\n10. **Staus-Quo:** Left is a huge fan of it. It doesn\'t want the status quo revisited, and that\'s something Right has found a cure of. It does exactly opposite of that. Just to give an example of that from Ashoka conversation itself....the students said, why do we want to change history books...why not let it be and move on? Then the lawyer told him that "history will always be influenced by a government whether it\'s left or right. For now, it\'s all left and as soon as right tweaks something in it...establishment in media starts shouting \'Saffronization\'. There is nothing more than that you can do about it anymore....because we are going for creating an independent body of experts which will re-write history books. The content of the book as well as the body will be challenged in  court if it\'s found including something which is agenda driven and not facts". Compare that to Romila Thapar. She refused to even debate on something which she herself has written.\n\nTL;DR: Indian left is becoming irrelevant day by day, but instead of introspection it still believes that silencing people is the way they are gonna survive. It won\'t..unless they mend their ways. India needs left...just not the one which is here right now.'<br />Author: 'ZackPhrut'  id: 'bkw7ob'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bkw7ob/i_posted_this_on_cancer_sub_and_as_expected_it/</li>

      <li>Title::: "India's democracy is, in fact, in danger..."<br />Body: 'Not because of the whole narrative by the Opposition parties that "Modi is a fascist, BJP is bad for constitution, etc.", but because we don\'t have a good Opposition. Now hear me out.\n\nIn a democracy, a good Opposition is really important. It is supposed to be a watchdog for the people, ensuring that the ruling party does not go astray. But what do we have in the name of Opposition? A party whose leader is mocked by literally everyone in India. Even many of the Congress supporters among the commons do not like RaGa at all. Leadership is many-a-times undermined by the Opposition supporters, going with the narrative of "Vote for the right MP, India is a representative democracy, etc.", but in reality, a good leadership is one of the most prominent things for the people as well as the nation. History has proven that a good leader combined with a good support system ensures the prosperity of the populace. Yes, democracy is the new norm but the importance of a good leadership hasn\'t changed.\n\nNow coming to the smaller Opposition parties, well, let\'s just say that they are too small or confined to their respective States. Hell, even the same party changes it\'s stance on issues in different States (the Communist Parties are notoriously known for this). How can the common people vote for them as a consolidated Opposition if their stance/ideologies  change/differ as if it\'s a game of dice?\n\nModi/BJP is not the best, hell, they have performed many blunders. But right now, they seem to be the best among the lot. And to be honest, that is what democracy has been. Voting for the best candidate that you think would benefit the nation in a better way than the rest.\n\nI really hope that Congress/AAP/or whatever emerges as a strong Opposition. India is in need of a good Opposition, denying this and screaming "Modi is the BEST, BJP is the best, they can do nothing wrong, etc." only makes us as delusional as those who think RaGa is a good prime ministerial candidate.\n\nLet me hear your thoughts on this whole thing.\n\nP.S. : NOTA is akin to a wasted vote, until it\'s given more powers (example : re-elections if NOTA is in majority or more than 50% votes are for NOTA), it will just be an option on the EVM that most voters don\'t even look at.'<br />Author: 'shubham_x1'  id: 'bkkwoy'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bkkwoy/indias_democracy_is_in_fact_in_danger/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Mahendra Karma the man who led the Jan Jagran Abhiyan to fight the Naxals in Chattisgarh, CH govt later created the Salwa Judum counterinsurgency militia group to fight the Naxals. The group was banned after a case was filed in SC by Nandini Sundar. Mahendra Karma was assassinated by Naxals in Sukma'<br />Body: "# Jan Jagran Abhiyan\n\nThe first movement against the Naxalites was the 'Jan Jagran Abhiyan', started in 1991 by Mahendra Karma, a local tribal leader. This was mostly led by local traders and businessmen.\n\nMahendra Karma, a Congress Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and  the leader of opposition in the State Legislative Assembly became the  public front and took the Bijapur-based movement to Dantewada, Katreli and other parts of the region.\n\n&gt;He was assassinated by Naxalites on 25 May 2013 in a Maoist attack while returning from a *Parivartan Rally* meeting organised by his party in Sukma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Salwa Judum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChhattisgarh’s secret funding and arming of the counterinsurgency militia group, the *Salwa Judum*,  is an example of state government’s attempts (albeit desperate at the  time) to fight the Naxals. \n\nWhen Chhattisgarh began its anti-Naxal  operations, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) faced severe  manpower shortages, requiring the recruitment of Special Police Officers  (SPOs) from the community. SPOs, with their local knowledge of  Naxal-affected areas, led raids on suspected rebel camps and were also  tasked with the responsibility of legitimising the rising *Salwa Judum* movement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite initial fears of arming *Salwa Judum* members due to the potential of people defecting to the Naxal cause, many SPOs with connections to the *Salwa Judum* were provided with a firearm (either a .303 rifle or an AK47) following their training period. The *Salwa Judum*  campaign, in conjunction with the SPOs, have played an influential role  in attracting self-professed Maoists to switch sides and provide  intelligence for local police forces. Many also hold double agent roles,  acting as secret SPOs, to gather intelligence for future CRPF  operations. \n\nWhile the informal counterinsurgency group has had some  successes, the *Salwa Judum* have also been a conflict-escalator. Some have viewed ongoing *Naxal/Salwa Judum* clashes as an extension of historical tribal clashes and it is increasingly polarising and politicising\xa0Red vs. Saffron  (Naxal vs. Hindu fundamentalist) tensions. The increasing tensions  between Hindu nationalists and Naxals have led to attacks from both  sides, creating fresh disputes in turn. Although, the efficacy and  effectiveness of informal counterinsurgency groups are questionable,  Naxal-affected states have been encouraged to form their own  counterinsurgency forces similar to the *Salwa Judum* in the 2000s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Supreme Court of India declared Salwa Judum illegal after a case was filed by Nandini Sundar\n\nOn 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India  in a case filed by Nandini Sundar and ors declared the militia to be  illegal and unconstitutional, and ordered its disbanding. The Court  directed the Chhattisgarh government to recover all the firearms,  ammunition and accessories. The use of Salwa Judum by the government for  anti-Naxal operations was criticised for its violations of human rights  and poorly trained youth for counter-insurgency roles. It also ordered  the government to investigate all instances of alleged criminal  activities of Salwa Judum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might do another thread covering some more aspects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendra\\_Karma***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahendra_Karma)\n\n[***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salwa\\_Judum***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salwa_Judum)\n\n[***https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262126651\\_Bastar\\_Maoism\\_and\\_Salwa\\_Judum***](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262126651_Bastar_Maoism_and_Salwa_Judum)\n\n[***https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Salwa-Judum-is-illegal-says-Supreme-Court/article13639702.ece***](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Salwa-Judum-is-illegal-says-Supreme-Court/article13639702.ece)\n\n[***https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45570271***](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45570271)\n\n[***https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/06/indias-aging-guerrillas-still-believe-in-the-struggle/***](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/06/indias-aging-guerrillas-still-believe-in-the-struggle/)\n\n[***http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/05/29/who-are-indias-maoists-and-why-they-are-in-the-news/***](http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/05/29/who-are-indias-maoists-and-why-they-are-in-the-news/)\n\n[***https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/2018/05/30/indian-counterinsurgency-the-decline-of-naxalism/***](https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/2018/05/30/indian-counterinsurgency-the-decline-of-naxalism/)\n\n[***http://gppreview.com/2019/03/21/rise-fall-triumph-south-asian-insurgencies-part-iii-india/***](http://gppreview.com/2019/03/21/rise-fall-triumph-south-asian-insurgencies-part-iii-india/)"<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'bjyv3z'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bjyv3z/mahendra_karma_the_man_who_led_the_jan_jagran/</li>

After JeM ban Eu Parliament may suspend all subsidies to Pakistan.'<br />Body: 'Indias continuous effort to isolate pak baring fruits.. After JeM ban Eu Parliament may suspend all subsidies to Pakistan.\n\nOn the 30 April 2019,\xa0fifty-one (51) Members of the European Parliament\xa0issued a collective letter addressed to Mr. Imran Khan, Prime Minister of the islamic Republic of Pakistan expressing their concerns, and seeking assurances that the persecution of religious minorities would cease immediately.\xa0\n\nThe letter highlighted that today’s Pakistan is far removed from being the country that its founding father,\xa0Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had envisaged. Jinnah had always insisted that Pakistan would be a Muslim majority State where people from all religions, whether Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Ahmadis or Shias, would be treated equally. Over the last seven decades, successive governments in Pakistan have contributed to\xa0implementing discriminatory systems\xa0that have resulted in political, economic and social persecution of religious minorities, which have encouraged acts of\xa0violenceagainst them by\xa0radical Islamic groups.\n\nIn the letter, the Members of the European Parliament criticize Pakistan and its establishment for falsely accusing and targeting individuals under the blasphemy law. They specifically cited the internationally condemned case of\xa0\xa0Asia Bibi, the Christian woman who had been falsely charged, harassed and sentenced to death row due to the country’s Blasphemy Laws.\n\nThe Members of the European Parliament urged\xa0Pakistan\xa0to take measures to\xa0dismantle\xa0the constitutional and institutional structures that have resulted in the\xa0purposeful targeting\xa0of religious minorities\xa0in the country. Should the violations of the International Covenant on Freedom of Religion continue, especially with regard to the persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, the Members of the European Parliament having signed the letter, would be compelled to call on the\xa0European Commission to suspend all subsidies and trade preferences\xa0until the effective implementation of the Convention could be assured by the\xa0Government of Pakistan.\n\n[Letter copy can be read here](https://eptoday.com/european-parliament-may-suspend-all-subsidies-to-pakistan/)'<br />Author: 'yeloblu'  id: 'bjsfkf'<br />Score:107<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bjsfkf/indias_continuous_effort_to_isolate_pak_baring/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Indian support for LTTE and Tamil insurgency / terror groups.'<br />Body: 'As this is a very poorly understood topic, copy pasting a comment of mine for now. Will build it up later today into a cohesive piece. Keep in mind this was a comment to someone else so it might not flow very well on its own. \n\nSources first. \n\n* Politics of Conflict by Vassilis K Fouskas - Vassilis clearly makes the case that RAW set up camps in TN to train and arm TELO first and then extended it to LTTE, PLOTE and EROS. \n\n* Indian Intervention in Lanka by Rohan Gunaratna - written by a SL from a SL pov and while I found it biased, still a compelling reason. He too makes the same case. He supposedly was given an open access to the archives of the NIB and hence this work definitely has a lot of credibility. \n\nHis theory and the theory of a few other analysts was that Raw helped the insurgency because of two reasons,\n\nA - Show the Tamils in India that they were sympathetic to their cause\n\nB - create pressures on Colombo and extract concessions for the treatment of Tamils / exclude Pakistan from SL orbit this also helps A. \n\nThe whole war was shittily complex, Jayawardene for instance armed the fucking LTTE during IPKF ops.... That is how shitty it was. \n\nYou then have the interviews of KP (very senior LTTE leader) where he is clear that the arming and training came from RAW and TN politicians generated a lot of the funding needed to sustain the war. \n\n* Urban Battle Fields of South Asia by Christine Fair also covers this\n\n* India\'s ocean : the store of India\'s bid for regional leadership by David Brewster covers this in extensive details. Really liked this book, helped provide clarity (to me) on why Rajiv initiated the IPKF. Startling revelations like OP Buster that Rajiv planned, where Indian conventional forces would split SL into two, Tamil north and Sinhalese South. \n\nIndira and later Rajiv believed that what Mukti Bahini did, destabilise Paki rule allowing India to use that as a Cassus Belli could be repeated here. \n\nYou want online citations, I don\'t have many but I think CFR.org\'s profile page on RAW explains this linkage. Will look it up and link you if needed. \n\nWe even know where the camps where, places like Chakrata in NCR and camps near Rameshwaram. \n\nIt wasn\'t just covert but we literally dropped supplies to LTTE via Op Poomalai (flower Garland). After SL launched Op Vadamarachchi / Liberation in May 1987, the tigers were faced with a relentless onslaught (fortified by Chinese and  Pakistani + Israeli training) by the SL army. Jaffna itself was besieged and the tiger supply depots overrun. It captured Valvettithurai (the Stalingrad for LTTE as Prabhakaran was born there) , it got so bad that Prabhakaran and Soosai (a key operations officer) escaped on boats (ostensibly to India). \n\nThe tigers had the men but no food or arms or ammo and their leadership had fled. The war could have been ended but Rajiv Gandhi felt that any settlement without India involved, and seen as protecting the Tamils was unacceptable. Pakistan, Israel and South Africa also had "advisors" on the ground. Rahul then threatened SL that it would take action. It then sent a flottila to Jaffna to deliver "humanitarian aid" but as the ships were merchant vessels the SL navy seized them. Then Rajiv faced with immense pressure from within (the media then called this a genocide, refugees started flooding in) so he authorised the use of the IAF. \n\nWe then sent 5 AN-32\'s escorted by 2 sqns of Mirage 2000\'s, into SL airspace and basically told SL to fuck right off. The stick also included some 50 journos, this meant that indiscriminate bombing by the SLA was out of the question. If they killed a US / Brit / Chinese / Indian journo even by accident...all hell would break lose. \n\nJayawardene admitted defeat and the entire OP was called off, right when it was winning. He feared that if he continued, India would intervene using her army and split SL into two. \n\nOur support for the LTTE and other Tamil groups is not just an myth but very real.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'bjr8j1'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bjr8j1/indian_support_for_ltte_and_tamil_insurgency/</li>

His organisation JeM was already an internationally declared terror org, but he himself was not. \n\nWhen the Balakot airstrikes happened, it was an attack on a banned global terror org. They did not need to clarify to anyone, WHY they would attack a JeM camp. They only disclosed that they has assets on the ground and their intel on the site and it\'s occupants was legit. \n\nThat brings me to my prediction. After reading Modi\'s statement I strongly feel that India has been tracking Azhar for the last 2 months and they know *exactly* where he is being kept hidden. If not tonight, then sometime in the next week, I have a strong gut feeling that Azhar will be eliminated.\n\nIndia now has an international green light to hit him wherever he is (just like they already had for JeM). Modi was waiting for that same green light to be able to give the go ahead and take him out.\n\nIf not tonight, then very very soon. \n\nModi is a huge fan of foreshadowing. He delivers subtle clues and hints at what he\'s about to do. And then follows through. His statement today was not made lightly. \n\nHe\'s also been adamant about "playing by the rulebook" so as not to be accused of flouting national or international laws (by any serious authority - that automatically excludes the jokers in opposition and their cabal of durbaris).\n\nMoreover, the score for Pulwama remains unsettled with Azhar still breathing. Everyone else is dead. The ~300 at Balakot, the ~100 odd infiltrators and JeM operatives on our turf, pretty much anyone of note related to JeM is now dead... but Azhar remains. Modi is not gonna let that remain uncorrected.\n\nLastly, it would prove (and provide a strong precedent) that India will now not just conduct strikes on big bases, but will hunt down even individuals and leadership, exactly like US has been doing, regardless of where they are, and regardless of how much time has passed.\n\nAnd obviously after that, every remaining seat going to polls will be a total rout in Modi\'s favour, across India.\n\nSo here\'s to Azhar\'s last days on Earth. 🍺🍺🍺🍺 Enjoy the 72 goats, asshole. \n\nI\'m fucking calling it.\n\nLet\'s see if I\'m right.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'bjn2np'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bjn2np/a_prediction_about_azhar_being_declared_a_global/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Impotent RW'<br />Body: 'Few months back when PewDiePie rolled out it\'s "subscribe to PewDiePie" meme no one thought it would become so big. I have still been asking myself how the fuck did these 9 year olds organized such a highly effective campaign. Even with his sub following coordinating with so many kids not adults but kids to actually keep PewDiePie number 1 for months to come is insane. Sure they have a lot of time on their hands but we should not downplay tye strategic sense of their campaign. They hit valuable targets at the right moment to raise their profile. They flooded YouTube with videos supporting their causes and did the same with other platforms. The movement eventually became so big that they couldn\'t even control it. Even a word against PewDiePie and they razed hell.\n\nOn the other hand is India\'s online RW who although have everything a movement needs but still are letting twitter walk over them. There isn\'t a person on RW who doesn\'t think that what happened with TrueIndology was wrong and stifling of free speech. It hasn\'t been the first time they did this and won\'t be the last. Their anti-right antics are also not new. But instead of organising something we sit in chairs and discuss making a Twitter alternative. I am not against that idea though if you think I am, but the fact of the matter is without any significant backlash not even that is  possible. \n\nOn twitter too the only thing I see are measly 170 tweets with #bringbackTrueIndology as its hash tag. Do you see a problem here? Even the hashtag isn\'t tweetable. It\'s too long, uncatchy and neutral. How do you think this would actually work is something I cannot understand. Meagre participation, bad strategy and no attention how is this going to make twitter sweat. The twitter execs must be laughing their asses right now. TBH they chose a very interesting timing for this, the election. Everyone is busy campaigning no one will even mind if we ban le random user here. Who are you waiting for? The left for all their "free speech" credentials won\'t be helping you. They are already happy a RW bhakt got banned.\n\nI just have only one question, do you only like to express outrage when something likes this happen or you want to actually take actions that make a difference? If the former or you disagree with me downvote and move on. If the latter, let\'s discuss actual strategy.'<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'bjetkp'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bjetkp/impotent_rw/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Why sadhvi pragya's views on Hemant Karkare are valid ?"<br />Body: 'The topic of hindu atankwad or saffron terrorism had a few top names as Sadhavi Pragya and Col. Purohit. The other day i found that Sadhvi Pragya got criticised heavily for her remarks on Hemant Karkare , a ATS member of Mumbai Police force who got killed by Ajmal Kasab during CST station terror attack of 2008. This criticism was heavily drawn on the narrative that Hemant Karkare was a martyr and Sadhvi Pragya was a terror accused. I am not posting this to outrage any nationalists here for questioning martyrdom but for unanswered questions from a prespective that needs to be told.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter Sadhvi pragya made the controversial statement , the election commision asked her to explain it. My prespective here is that government can classify someone as a martyr but you cannot enforce that and ask everyone to follow it. Primarily , why pragya thakur made this statement is because she got tortured in jail mentally and physically and in anger she made this statement. But all media houses are trying to skin her alive as if she is terrorist, but she is yet to be declared as one. so isnt that a crime to call her a terrorist before being proven as one. same with sadhvi who called hemant as corrupt without proof, which is also a crime. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what i need to point out is on 26/11/2008 , he got killed by ajmal kasab . He wasnt wearing a bulletproof vest is the record of police department and he got termed as martyr as per this record. Kamte , vijay salaskar got martryed same way. But within 3 months , a book came out by the name (" Who killed Karkare?")\\[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10587044-who-killed-karkare-the-real-face-of-terrorism-in-india](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10587044-who-killed-karkare-the-real-face-of-terrorism-in-india)\\] written by ex DG Police department of Maharashtra , Samshuddin Mushrif. In this book he claimed kasab didnt kill karkare or his fellow officers but it was the Intelligence beaura conspired, orchestrated and in the end killed all of them. It was really praised by all intellectuals and liberals. Oddly enough This book was released by Digvijay singh who is now contesting against Sadhvi Pragya. So if Samshuddin sir is saying is true than this is not martyrdom but an encounter or more specifically fake encounter  just like ishrat jahan. So the then UPA government allegedly conducted this encounter. So what is true - Martyrdom or Encounter? Oddly enough this entire confusion has liberals and intellectuals supporting both sides of the spectrum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the topic comes of proof before his death for 9 months consistently karkare said he has collected all the proofs against Sadhvi pragya. In 2009 UPA got a second term and NIA got established . Chidambaram became the Home minister . 2009 -2014 , the accused were bounced off from court to court why did they not run a case against the accused if they had all the proofs? Why were they not presented? As against they not only processed the case but also hanged kasab and it has been close to 5 years since this event. So if UPA claims  NDA government has destroyed the case and let the terror accused go, then what were they doing since 2009-2014 ?? Why cant they run the case? The biggest question was Within 25-30 days of arrest of these accused why did they filed MOCOCA?  MOCOCA is not an law against terrorism but its a law against organised crime . why did they apply This organised crime law against Sadhvi pragya , The MOCOCA court rejected this case citing the same resaon. So this leads to a pertinent question how can you be sure if other the other laws which are applied against Sadhvi pragya are correct ? There are big holes in the investigation by the same reasoning. Even the 2006malegaon blast  case before this , the accused that were caught were totally unrelated  which were later released. But they were also dumped in jail for almost 2 -3  years with no court trials. Col. purohit got bail after 8-9 years and the  (court statement reads that there is no consistency in ats and nia claims)\\[[https://mpsja.mphc.gov.in/Joti/pdf/LU/bail.pdf](https://mpsja.mphc.gov.in/Joti/pdf/LU/bail.pdf)\\] so one cannot put someone in jail for 8-9 years with no trial. Arguably for what ? Please some community? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if martyr is the basis of debate then i accept the premise but one must equally condemn the book. On one end you want to call him a martyr and on the other end call it an encounter . This is double cross what it is. The people who are outraging are two faced assholes with no sense of justice.'<br />Author: 'neem_coated_urea'  id: 'bj34di'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bj34di/why_sadhvi_pragyas_views_on_hemant_karkare_are/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Blocking of certain websites because of a court order is NOT a violation of Net Neutrality'<br />Body: 'I have been seeing that certain India related subreddits are falsely equating block of certain websites as an infringement of Net Neutrality. However, if said block is occurring because of a court order then ISPs are by law required to comply with the court order. Madras High Court decided to ban Tik Tok and Google Play removed it, similarly certain court had passed an order requesting the ban of [soundcloud](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/02/13/soundcloud-india-block/)  which also included a list of 800 other websites or so. Now these are court orders which any ISP is by law required to follow. Going around trumpeting "Net Neutrality is being violated" is of no use in these cases. Challenge these lower court orders in the supreme court and the website\'s ban will be lifted if the supreme court finds merit in your argument. What is happening here is a simple case of court exercising the powers vested to them, if someone has a problem with that then argue against the judicial system of the country which also involves the CJI hearing his own case and giving himself a clean chit. But FFS, please don\'t spew crap about Net Neutrality being violated or the government blocking websites. Net Neutrality is a framework established by the regulator TRAI, said framework has no provision to allow ISPs to skirt court orders. Funny part is the Net Neutrality seems to be violated only if your favorite website is blocked on not if an app like Tik Tok gets removed in its entirety from the app store running on 95% of the country\'s smartphone.

      <li>Title::: 'Narrative and control!'<br />Body: "It is all about narrative and  who controls the narrative. If BJP or NDA does not get majority, the narrative will be that people of India have rejected hindutva and hindutva politics, if they get majority and form the government, then the narrative will be that there was EVM tampering. In both the cases the left is going to control the mainstream narrative, in all 5 years of NDA rule, barring the honeymoon period and  demonetisation, dharmics have never controlled the narrative, they are always on the defensive, always responding to the criticism flung upon it for various issues like mob lynching, hindutva politics etc. If you want to control the narrative, you have to create an ecosystem, which the NDA govt completely failed to do because of their intellectual deficit. When during their rule, dharmics cannot express openly, serious intellectuals like TrueIndology gets booted out, just imagine if Congress led or third front comes then what will happen. \n\nTo create a healthy ecosystem first you need platforms, digital, tv, print etc. Right wing has some representation in tv and print medium because these mediums have benefit of using vernacular languages. It is the digital medium where dharmic point of view does not get represented properly. Most of the digital platforms are controlled by either american or chinese corporates which are a front for their government and intelligence agencies. They through their left wing and even right wing proxies in India, directly or indirectly manage our social media and mainstream discourse. These proxies and minions in their idealistic(marxist/postmodernist) world view think they are on the right side by subverting dharma and promoting far left ideas in connivance with islamic and christian fundamentalists. They don't see the big picture because they have been brainwashed by academia and everything they see and do is through the lens of identity politics. They are they perfect pawns for the intelligence agencies and other breaking India forces. \n\nWe seriously need social media alternatives for Twitter, facebook, whatsapp or even tiktok. It's not about whether these platforms are good or bad for culture, if you cannot ban them, control them. You simply cannot control Google,fb,twitter, but you can control the narrative if it is an Indian platform. Indian platform doesn't mean having extremely right wing hindutva platform, it should be very similar to fb and twitter, but controlled in India by Indian people. We don't need 4chan or voat or breitbart like platform, they are extremely racist, sexist white supremacist platforms, Dharmic ecosystem isn't right wing as the left wing portrays it to be, it encompasses all the ecosystems from left wing to right wing, from liberal to conservative to libertarian, from theists to athiests to agnostsics. Our philosophies are far more mature in these regards. \n\nOne of the biggest damage done by, western proxies in India  was, virtually mapping american political discourse to Indian political discourse, american left wing to Indian left wing, and american right wing to Indian right wing, christian right wingers to hindu right wingers, creating false equivalences. So you will see these cases like how cow protection in India is seen as compared to dog and cat protection in US, this is the dissonance and double standards of these people. \n\nUltimately it is about the narrative and platforms and will always be about it, China understands it, Russia understands it, they have virtually insulated their society from the american hegemony and its propaganda by creating firewalls, data laws and digital platform alternatives. Hell, even Europeans are wary of american companies(GDPR), we are the only big country and only civilization which does not have our own narrative, our own platforms to promote it, and safeguards to protect it. \n\nDue to nature of our culture our narrative passed down through the generations by families, through rituals, traditions, lore, mythology, itihas, festivals, hindu calendar etc, but i feel the break is coming, this generation is probably the last generation, due to rise of technology and social media and mobile, our kids have become disconnected, they don't even know abc of it, they now see it through the lens of bollywood and the western media. Like we lost all the local varieties of food grains, fruits and cows with the advent of green and white revolution, we will lose our traditions, rituals, philosophies and languages too. They wont be completely lost, but they will be repackaged and sold back to us like yoga, mindfulness, transcendental meditation, intermittent fasting, turmeric latte and etc etc.  It's high time to take back the control of our narrative, I am not saying that everybody will agree and do it, but those who understand it, whatever the are of your expertise is, please contribute in that area, if you are a historian take cue from TrueIndology, if you are software developer, create digital platforms, apps, websites and so on, but please help contribute in creating long lasting institutions, just trolling on social media won't do. \n\nPeace"<br />Author: 'antarikhsha'  id: 'bizvkn'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bizvkn/narrative_and_control/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Emissary - The Reckoning of Caste Politics'<br />Body: '# Part 4 of Our Series on the Indian Elections\n\n# [The Reckoning of Caste Politics](https://theemissary.co/the-reckoning-of-caste-politics/)\n\nCaste is entrenched in the mind of many Indians, thus spreading naturally into politics.\n\nMy personal opinion on the caste system is that it has been an ***abominable, destructive, and divisive force in Indian history***, but that is a topic for another post. Its manifestation in politics starts from the British Raj when certain castes were labeled as criminals under the [Criminal Tribes Act](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864482?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Other castes were stripped of their possessions and land which were transferred to other castes. This was the ***British Raj’s signature divide and rule*** in action.\n\n### Casting Shadows\n\nIn 1930, the British Prime Minister, Ramsey MacDonald, proposed the [Communal Award](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communal-Award) – essentially the granting of proportional electorates to India. The thing was, while most groups were divided as united entities (Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and even Anglo-Indians), Hindus were explicitly divided into separate castes. The ***tribalism in their hearts*** that had undone them so much in the past was reignited and institutionalized.\n\nA backlash ensued so that in 1932, the act was reformed to include the [Poorna Pact.](http://www.ambedkar.org/impdocs/poonapact.htm) This act accepted a united Hindu electorate, but with caste reservation within it. At this point, it was semantic imagery as the division was still in place.\n\nWith Indian Independence, the constitution rightfully outlawed the practice of untouchability (however it still persisted at ground level). The great social reformer and architect of the constitution, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, proposed a temporary 10 year reservation system to help uplift lower castes from the current and past discrimination they faced. While this sounds like a dream to many socialists today, Ambedkar favored capitalism and abhorred communism. With the newfound opportunity from reservations, Ambedkar wanted the lower castes to obtain capital and create wealth. ***For no one looks at the caste of the coin.***\n\nYet, removing this reservation system would be political suicide for the party that did it. The lower castes and tribals (Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe) have been between 20-30% of the population of India since independence. No party in their right mind would shoot themselves in the foot by removing the temporary reservation. So it has been renewed every 10 years, now expiring in 2020 (but it will probably be renewed). It very much has become the ***sacred cow of Indian politics.***\n\nBut the story of reservation doesn’t end here. In 1979, the Morarji Desai government started the creation of the [Mandal Commission.](http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Writereaddata/Mandal%20Commission%20Report%20of%20the%201st%20Part%20English635228715105764974.pdf) This commission would extend reservation to a group of castes collectively known as Other Backwards Castes. These castes were said to have lagged on economic and social parameters. Even though many protests occurred for almost a decade, the Mandal Commission was implemented in 1992. This pushed the total reservation to ***49.5% for SCs, STs, and OBCs*** for various government and public sector functions including education.\n\nVarious state governments have also joined into the reservation game adding on even more castes into the fray pushing total reserved seats over 50% and in some [***extreme cases over 69% such as in Tamil Nadu.***](https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/tamil-nadu-has-69-percent-reservations-but-before-supreme-court-put-the-cap/1406256)\n\nNow reservation itself has shown mixed to positive results. It has been very effective for STs who have seen [reduced poverty and social mobility.](https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/political-reservation-in-india-the-effect-on-poverty.html) While SCs have had less well off fortunes on a big picture level, research shows that [local reservation and strong visible leaders aid social mobility.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2965/fb4368cfe8edde756fb8ae752f2b6d271156.pdf) This may be because STs have tight knit, self-sufficient communities. SCs are stuck in abject poverty and discrimination in their rural environments with little support.\n\nHowever, education and urbanization may be the strongest antidote to caste. A [stronger market economy](https://voxdev.org/topic/labour-markets-migration/caste-and-economic-mobility-india) would also help as Ambedkar prophesied; once lower castes gain access to capital and entrepreneurship, ***the money speaks louder than the ritual.***\n\nIt must also be said that local religious and community leaders must combat caste discrimination in their places of worship and organizations. These private initiatives would be the most impactful on a local level, which empowers individuals possibly even greater than reservation in the long run.\n\n### Old Habits Die Hard\n\nWith caste cemented institutionally, of course it would bleed into political parties.\n\nVarious parties across India sprang up to represent the interests of a specific caste or group of castes. There was a toxic formula that arose from this phenomenon.\n\n1. Rally a caste/community or coalitions of them and attain enough of a vote share to win the election.\n2. Fill government posts with your own caste members and favor your caste in policy, positions, and politics.\n3. Demonize other parties as discriminatory towards your caste if they suggest equal treatment of all or do not prescribe to putting your own caste first.\n\nNow that this game has been set, the players come in. Here’s a few examples of today’s caste parties:\n\n* **Bahujan Samaj Party** – A Dalit (SC) party headed by Mayawati. Claims ideology inspired by BR Ambedkar and various other Dalit leaders. Seeks to represent all SCs, STs, OBCs. Mayawati has become extremely wealthy since her political rise and even created statues of herself during her rule in Uttar Pradesh. She said it was the “will of the people” to build them.\n* **Samajwadi Party** – A party of Yadavs (OBC) and Muslims. Dynastically ruled by Akhilesh Yadav, son of Mulayam Singh Yadav. They have become famous for appeasement and mafia rule during their reign in Uttar Pradesh.\n* **Rashtriya Janata Dal** – A Bihari version of the Samajwadi Party as it too has courted the Yadav and Muslim vote. Its patriarch, Lalu Prasad Yadav, is in jail for corruption so his son Tejaswi Yadav has taken over. Another party famous for its *goondagiri* and corruption.\n\nTo combat these caste parties, larger parties have had to pay attention to caste arithmetic in elections where they would have to cater to the various divisions and sub-divisions of castes to find a high enough vote share to win. Different caste members would be propped into candidature to cover the seat demographics.\n\nOne of the worst parts about this system has become that there are large numbers of people who vote almost solely on caste. A political idiom has been born: ***Indians do not cast their vote, they vote their caste.***\n\nSo to ensure victory, a candidate would be chosen based on caste rather than merit in many backwards, rural districts. These districts frequently decide elections in areas such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and indeed much of rural India.\n\nThe more poor and uneducated an area is, the stronger caste becomes. ***For caste parties, it is very beneficial for these areas to remain backwards.***\n\nWith the current central government’s manic endeavor for development, especially for the poor, Modi has thrown the gauntlet to these caste parties.\n\n### Breaker of Chains\n\nModi’s nationalism has been a powerful tool of unity. While certain Hindu radicals unfortunately arise, in his speeches Modi has preached the model of “*Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas*” – For Everyone, Development for Everyone. In 2014, Modi won by a wave of anti-corruption, development, and nationalism where a ***United Spectrum of Hindu votes (USHV) superseded caste.***\n\nTraditionally, left parties have used caste as a weapon against the Hindu right. Hindu unity would be broken by caste agitations and grievances. While ideally, parties such as the BJP would massively benefit from the elimination of the caste system, it must be said that there are elements in the BJP that engage in upper caste favoritism.\n\nBut here’s the catch, Narendra Modi himself has the background of a poor OBC. This opens a whole new mindset and skin in the game. ***The tallest leader of the supposed “upper-caste” party is a lower caste.*** So what has Modi done in regards to caste?\n\nModi’s development schemes may be the biggest game changers versus caste politics. Initiatives such as [Ayushman Bharat, Ujwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat, etc](https://theemissary.co/the-special-one/)… have largely impacted poor, lower caste households. These families now have access to healthcare, clean cooking, and toilets among various other developments such as better electricity access and financial inclusion. The polls will tell if this development can break caste.\n\nAs for reservations, Modi has mostly left it alone – except for one explosive action this year. He proposed a new category – the Economically Weaker Section – a ***10% reservation category consisting of the poorest of General Category*** (non-SC/ST/OBC Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc…). While this is a fairly small percentage, it produced a bombshell in Indian politics.\n\nFor the first time in history, the central government had provided reservation based on economics, not on caste. The General Category (non ST/SC/OBC) were of course massively enthused.\n\n### The Choice\n\nWhat we now see is a battle between unity and development versus division and caste. It’s mind-boggling that many of the self-styled “Liberals” in India are either ***silent on or endorse these caste parties to defeat Modi.*** Parties, pollsters, and journalists are calculating caste populations and sampling their interviews by caste proportions to obtain a salient view of what’s to come May 23rd.\n\nBut the wildcard in this election is of course Narendra Modi. His various development schemes and rags to riches infused nationalism have captured the imagination of Indians. The opposition still has yet to even announce a Prime Minister as infighting ensues. This betrays any semblance of capability to run a coalition and coherently lead a nation. An ugly mirror to the degeneracy of caste itself.\n\nThe opportunity of Modi’s victory is the first step towards a post-caste electorate. An electorate that votes on issues such as ***development, national security, and ideology*** rather than someones’s last name. Education and embracing capitalism rather than freebies provide a powerful tool for the downtrodden castes.\n\nWith action and faith, India must banish the demons of caste not only in politics, but also in the community, the family, and individual. Modi’s 2019 campaign may be the first nail in the coffin for the ***Reckoning of Caste Politics.***\n\nAs always, please do comment/critique and share our post/website if you like our stuff :D'<br />Author: 'TheEmissaryCo'  id: 'bizesr'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bizesr/the_emissary_the_reckoning_of_caste_politics/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'One question to Opposition'<br />Body: "It was brigade ground in Kolkata where leaders of 21 parties met and the each one of them unanimously voiced their goal against a very huge crowd of 8 lacs in strength. \n\nWe have seen time and again across the political rallies. The main goal of the opposition across india  was to remove narendra modi and amit shah . \n\nIf removing modi -shah duo is their primary concern why haven't they worked on Varanasi constituency like smriti irani did on Amethi. It's not like modi could run away or choose two seats. It would dent his claim to the throne. All the opposition talk was to remove modi , it could have fielded a joint candidate right from the start . At the very end of the nomination they announced the suspended bsf soldier tej bahadur yadav  as their candidate. \n\nCongress was eyeing for priyanka to stand against modi . She purposefully passed on this message as well. After that she claims party people told her not to contest and the party people like chacko says it was her decision. Arguably it was a right call not to fight a losing seat but doing it this way created a really bad  image of leadership in front of congress workers and cadre on the ground. Not to mention if arvind kejriwal who fought against modi last time didn't have the guts to contest and he is the most vocal proponent of removing modi and shah. \n\nSo this proves that entire opposition has been fighting for their existence all along. They have no development agenda . Removing modi and shah is  their priority is the biggest lie they have forced in face of their voters and vote banks. If this is not cowardice , lies and fighting for existence,  what is ?"<br />Author: 'Dar1ndha'  id: 'biyk8m'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/biyk8m/one_question_to_opposition/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Rubbing Trade Partners the Wrong Way: How India’s Trade Frictions With the World Will Shape the International Trading Regime'<br />Body: ' \n\nBetween 2008 and 2018, China was the country most often [mentioned](https://pudding.cool/2018/12/countries/) in NYT headlines, and was the most commonly mentioned nation in ten of twelve months. China is in the news so frequently, in large part because of its spectacular economic rise, and the United States trade war against China in response. India’s has had one of the fastest growing economies in the world over the last ten years, and total exports of manufactured goods and services has doubled over this [period](https://www.trademap.org/Index.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1), faster than any other nation in the G20. India’s rise as a major power in the world of global trade has inevitably led to frictions and new trade disputes. In today’s podcast episode, I am going to explore the implications of India’s economic rise on the rules that govern international trade today. I will be discussing India’s trade conflicts surrounding its tariffs and subsidies to agriculture, India’s conflict over its more permissive interpretation of intellectual property laws, and its desire for greater access to trade related visas to the United States and other nations.\n\nIndia will be holding elections for the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament, through April and May of 2019. Given that approximately two thirds of India’s population lives in rural [areas](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.rur.totl.zs?end=2017&amp;start=2008&amp;year_low_desc=true), voter turnout rates in rural areas are consistently [higher](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/how-indias-cities-vote-why-the-urban-vote-matters/articleshow/68161241.cms) than in urban areas, and rural regions are [overrepresented](https://faculty.polisci.wisc.edu/bhavnani/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bhavnani-Malapportionment-web-version.pdf) in the Lok Sabha, it is unsurprising that Indian politicians heavily court the rural vote. For example, the government of Narendra Modi increased agricultural [subsidies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/with-his-eye-on-elections-modi-lets-india-s-subsidy-bill-surge) by 15%, in the run-up to the Indian elections. However, these subsidies and the broader need to appeal to the rural electorate has created major tensions with India’s trading partners. Subsidizing India’s milk industry has long been a [cornerstone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002463019090104C) of Indian rural development strategy, but a major glut in milk production has led to serious rural unrest. The states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, two major milk producers, responded by offering a $727 subsidy a [ton](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-milk-exports-exclusive/exclusive-indias-milk-powder-exports-to-surge-on-subsidies-dampen-global-prices-idUSKBN1KH0GQ) on milk exports to find international markets, but major milk producers such as New Zealand and United States by [lodging](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/sops-for-skimmed-milk-powder-exports-come-under-wto-lens/article25105134.ece) protests at the WTO.

India has long been in conflict with wealthy nations over issues of intellectual property. In [1970](http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/19652/1/JIPR%201%281%29%2010-15.pdf), India passed a major reform to its intellectual property law that excluded pharmaceuticals from product patent production. The law saw a proliferation of drug makers focused on bringing the price of medicines down. Most dramatically, [Indian](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/84/5/news10506/en/) drug makers were essential in bringing the price of a years supply of HIV drugs down from $10,000 to $200. However, as India’s economy liberalized in the 1990s, India sought to join the WTO. The WTO, however, felt that Indian drug makers, who did not have to invest in research and development, to flood markets with copy-cat products. India (and other nations seeking to join the WTO) forced India to sign up to certain minimum standards on IP production, known [as](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46259403/1467-9701.0029920160605-26096-cy8tfh.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1555901790&amp;Signature=%2FvHHNDjBkWXZ%2Bz2m2sopV8ZQfiU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPharmaceutical_patents_prices_and_welfar.pdf) TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). By signing up to TRIPs, Indian drug makers gained access to developed country markets. The US today imports [$5 billion](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProductCountry_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c699%7c%7c%7c%7c30%7c%7c%7c2%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1) worth of pharmaceuticals, and [40%](http://chemindigest.com/indian-pharma-companies-40-generics/) of generics are made by Indian companies. One notable area where Indian generic drug manufacturers do not have access to the Indian market is insulin. Insulin prices have [soared](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20190122/NEWS/190129990/rising-insulin-prices-drive-higher-diabetes-care-spending) from $2,864 to $5,705 from 2012 to 2016 in part due to the [oligopoly](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/novo-nordisk-eli-lilly-and-sanofi-must-face-lawsuit-over-insulin-prices.html) of Sanofi, Eli Lily and Novo Nordisk.

In the early 2000s, the typical Indian programmer earned only a [quarter](http://homepages.rpi.edu/~simonk/pdf/bodyshopping.pdf) of their American counterparts. This process, known as Body-Shopping, allowed Indian programmers to earn strong salaries by Indian standards and American corporations to have access to cheap labor.

You\'re now actually living in one of the best time India has seen since 1947. Appreciate its value.\n\nThose of us who were born decades earlier suffered (yes, suffered) through the Scamgress dynasty rule. 1960s? Indira wrested power from the other old leaders and India which could have been different had its course set. 1970s? Indira ruled India, corrupted institutions, imposed emergency when she did not have her way, pulled down the government that had come in after she was voted out. 1980s? She continued until 1984 when she died as a result of her own deeds (she had propped up Bhindranwale). And then came Pappu Senior with a large mandate he squandered on Bofors and Shah Bano.\n\nMeanwhile regional satraps, sometimes clearly contributing to tendencies towards dissolution of the union of India itself began to take root. They had been squised in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s the afterglow of the freedom movement faded and reality began to set in and the 1962 debacle did not exactly help matters.\n\nHere are a few anecdotes. \n\n* In a place like TN where I lived for many years, you had to deal with the water shortages that only increased over the years. Nearby businesses violated laws by bribing the workers in the water works and installed pumps. So unless you got up early (~ 4 AM) and hand pumped the water, the water would be all gone by about 6 AM. No water for drinking, cooking or even washing your behind. \n\n* Wanted to get milk for the day? You had to wake up early in the morning and head out to a crowd in the metal structure nearby called a "milk booth" where you waited until the lorry came by with the polythene bags, jostled with those who wanted more than two or three bags, paid the money and went home.\n\n* No fridges. You took some of the milk and set it up to curdle overnight. If the milk was "spoilt", well, you just enjoyed the "unusual" taste, or made some sweet out of it. Vegetables? You woke up early and went to the nearby gharana to buy it. Every day. Housewives were exceptionally good at spotting brinjals with bugs in them.\n\n* Wanted a phone? You applied, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. For years. Yes, years. Unless you were "connected" in some way to someone in the power structure in the phone monopoly. And then you got your precious piece. You paid for outgoing calls, and IIRC, there came a point when you paid for incoming calls as well. Timed of course. \n\n* Wanted a gas cylinder subscription? That was another struggle. You waited. And waited. And waited. And one day you got it.\n\n* Just graduated? Everyone in the family prayed that you would quickly get a job. Good luck with that if you were not in a dynamic city like Mumbai. When you did finally get a job (preferably a "government" job or a PSU job) the entire family celebrated. Left a job, especially a government job? You were looked at as if you were a murderer of your family.\n\n* Government hospitals? Plagued with unsanitary conditions, including with rats running around. Needles being reused without sterilization. Yes, seen all that.\n\n* Ration shops. This was the public distribution system for grains. You took your card, stood in a *very long* queue and got your share after paying. And you needed exact change. I did not have it once and had to go through hell (was barely in my teens IIRC). The rice itself had to be picked. You found pebbles (added by middlemen to increase the weight so that the government scales could be fooled) and other "non vegetarian" items often alive. Women folk picked them out. \n\nThere was a lot more but these should give you an idea. This was India, and the rest of the world was moving on. Including Sri Lanka which but for the Sinhalese-Tamil problem would have gone far ahead of India. And through and because of all these and more, those of us and our parents\' generations who lived through it during the formative and productive years of our lives lost innumerable opportunities. Chamchagiri was the only way you could escape the obscure poverty that most of us had to go through because the legendary wealth of India had been drained, literally.\n\nMake no mistake about it. This was the Scamgress heyday. If you are born after 1990 when international institutions forced India to liberalise, you have *no idea* how things were. \n\nAnd the same Scamgress, the same dynasty that has ruled it was responsible and still refuses to go away.

      <li>Title::: '[OC] Analysis of Patna Sahib seat involving Ravishankar Prasad and Shatrughna Sinha based on past election results and electoral arithmetic.'<br />Body: 'Patna Sahib is not only the most important Loka Sabha constituency in Bihar but in 2019 polls it has been given extra glitter due to a direct contest between Union Minister and one of the seniormost leaders of BJP, Ravishankar Prasad, and sitting MP Shatrughan Sinha who has switched party from BJP to Congress. Patna Sahib is an urban constituency and has been very safe for BJP since delimitation.\n\nIn 2009 Shatrughan Sinha won by 1.66 lakh votes receiving more than twice the number of votes of his nearest opponent from RJD. It was the year when NDA had a near complete sweep in Bihar winning 32 out of 40 seats and victory in Patna was along the expected lines. Congress had flown in another actor from Patna, Mr Shekhar Suman, to contest against Sinha but he recieved a meagre 61,000 votes amounting to 11.1% and in process losing deposit. Sinha also won 57% of the votes cast making it clear that either he or NDA had a complete lockdown on the votes.\n\nThe 2014 LS elections provides us with a little more variation in data because JDU was not a member of the NDA and contested the elections alone. This time Cingress and RJD were contesting together. LJP contested with RJD in 2009 but NDA in 2014. Once again the results were no different. Shatrughan Sinha won 55% of the votes, more than twice the number of votes compared to his nearest competitor from RJD, and JDU candidate came distant third with 91k votes losing his deposit in the process. This time turnout went up from 33% to 45%, an improvement of 12%. However, this did not lead to big changes in the percentage of votes polled by each party. It is also clear that neither RJD nor Congress have transferrable votes. Together they won 38% in 2009 but only 25% in 2014.\n\nThis shows that either BJP or Shatrughan Sinha have a very strong hold on the city. But both of them are contesting on the opposite side this election. Question is who wins? To check if the support is for Sinha or BJP we need an election where Shatrughan Sinha is out of picture. That is exactly what we get in 2015 assembly election. This is even better considering the elections were contested between NDA and Mahagathbandhan which included JDU, RJD and Congress. This was the strongest opposition to BJP that is possible under the current electoral arithmetic bases on parties, caste or religion.\n\nIn the six consituencies that form Patna Sahib Lok Sabha consituency BJP contested 5 and won all of them. The sixth seat was contested by LJP who lost it to RJD. RJD won one out of 3 seats it contested, Congress lost 2 and JDU lost 1. This clearly shows that the support in the consituency is for BJP. Non BJP parties are pretty weak. Even NDA constituent parties other than BJP are not very strong as shown by RJD snatching that seat from BJP. A BJP candidate will win. Now we will take a look at the votes polled by each party and see how it compares with 2009 and 2014 LS elections. This will help us to find out if there is any effect of the candidate Shatrughan Sinha and hence how many votes is he likely to swing the way of Congress.\n\nBJP received 4.16 lakh votes out of 9.77 lakh votes. This amounts to 42% of the total votes cast. However if you exclude the seat contested by LJP their voteshare in the five constituencies was 50.6%. A clear majority but not as dominant as 55-57% recieved by Sinha in two previous polls. In the six seats JDU-RJD-INC trio received 3.81 lakh votes or about 39% of the votes polled. This is clearly a 4% swing in favor of Mahagathbandhan from 2014 LS elections. Votes lost by BJP were gained by the coalition. However, this is less than the 5% statewide swing against NDA.\n\nIn 2019 elections BJP is not likely to perform at the same level as in 2014 LS elections. But again they will be boosted by return of JDU to their fold and this will help them make up any loss from 2014 elections. This seat looks pretty safe for BJP. However there is a caveat. The Caste factor. Patna is an urban consituency and being the capital of the state it is a trading hub. The dominant cate in this seat is Kayastha, the community to which Mr Sinha belongs. The community prefers BJP over other parties for very obvious reasons but it is to be seen if they will chose to vote with Sinha sheerly due to name recognition. Ravi Shankar Prasad is also a Kayastha so caste in itself should not be a that big of a problem.\n\nOverall, I would rate this seat as safe BJP with a possibility of a small swing against them compared to previous elections.'<br />Author: 'Shriman_Ripley'  id: 'bibf7n'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bibf7n/oc_analysis_of_patna_sahib_seat_involving/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is the EC incompetent or biased against Modi'<br />Body: "This is a question worth asking. Is the EC incompetent or biased against Modi or even against BJP overall.\n\nI have small amount of points, some are known, some are not. This raises questions if they are neutral or biased.\n\nFirst is of course, the Modi biopic. The Modi biopic was banned around the time of elections by the EC as they said it would wrongly influence voters. Not only that, they also banned the web series. What's important is that EC has fought against the movie and the series with an questionable amount of force in the SC. This inspite of the fact that Udta Punjab if I remember correctly, was released around the Punjab elections and yet inspite of all the protests, it was  allowed to be released. Why no such influence of voter argument was considered then and why EC did not protest against Udta Punjab in the SC during the Punjab elections. Another thing to mention that Soni Razdan's film, named No Fathers in Kashmir, which had political undertones, was allowed to be released. Why no influence of voter in that movie.\n\nTo take this further, at least two TV shows were sent notices by EC for mentioning or even referring to one or two schemes of Modi government like swatch bharat. How or why can an news anchor talk or criticize a government scheme but a TV show cannot even mention them if they are part of the script. I can understand reality news vs scripted show but if that is so then why comedians on internet are not sent notices for the same. One more thing I would like to mention is that no such restrictions existed and if they did then implemented during 2014 elections - shows were openly made to influence voter opinion. What made them change their stance. This happened before SC getting angry at them for being ineffective.\n\nComing to SC calling them ineffective. Since then, EC has taken actions against many netas from different parties. In those cases, it only banned netas for 48 to 72 hours from rallying. However, in a specific case, what made EC file an FIR against Gambhir, a new person to politics, for holding a rally without permission. Why does EC think a politician's comments - read Azam's comments on Prada - which can be considered as sexual harrassment under Section 354A of IPC deserves only a ban from campaigning but Gambhir of BJP not taking permission or forgetting to take permission for raply deserves a FIR. Is a woman's privacy, her sexual rights, her dignity, that too of a woman who is a politician who comes under EC's laws and as being an politician is a representative of many woman of this country, less important for EC than permission to hold a rally.\n\nComing back to effectiveness of EC. Why does EC prevents religion based politics, yet it allowed RaGa to do and capture his temple run with cameras during state elections, thereby using religion undertones as an way to capture votes and influence the voter.\n\nEC prevents religion based politics, yet it allowed caste based politics. Why one is considered bad and one is considered fine.\n\nWhy Mayawati is allowed to insult Modi's caste but no notice has been sent to her. Insulting someone by cast is an punishable offence. Yet Mayawati is allowed to insult Modi by his caste and yet EC does nothing.\n\nTalking about EC's lack of actions. From last 5 years, EC and it's CEO has been called names, abused, called Modi's sidekick and many such things by the opposition leaders. They have also made unproven, wild, unsubstantiated allegations against the EVMs. All this has done is it has insulted the whole idea of unbiased and free elections of this country which are considered as paramount event in the country's democracy. It has also influenced public opinion on the effectiveness, use and integrity of the EC and voting of this country. It has further decreased the public's trust in the EC and the elections of this country. Trust without which no voter will go out to vote. EC is an constitutional authority, however it has allowed opposition to one influence voters by fake allegations against EC and EVMs thereby insulting the constitutional authority of this country. All this yet EC has not taken a single action against them.\n\nThen comes some local issue related to my city Mumbai. Recently in an interview to Rajdeep Sardesai, RJ Malishka admitted that she was chosen / hired by EC as an ambassador to promote elections in the city and inspire voters to vote in this elections. What Malishka also admitted that she was a RaGa fan and she loved the on-stage interview she took of RaGa in a collage of Pune some days ago. Did EC hire her after knowing that she was probably hired by a political party to do it's party president's interview, something that can amount to conflict of interest. Or did Malishka do an interview inspite of already being the EC's ambassador thereby taking his interview while being appointed by EC and trying to influence the voter. This raises the question of neutrality of EC's workers or ambassadors.\n\nTalking about Mumbai again, there have been two big things related to this city. In the 2014 elections, a lot of new voters had registered. However, all the names, new and previous ones, from areas well known to be pro-BJP and pro-Modi were massively wiped out from the voters list. It happened right under EC's nose. It was well documented in the local newspapers. It happened on such a scale that it could be considered an election crime or even a scam. Yet, 5 years went by, EC did nothing about it. While I am not aware if EC promised to look into it, yet no known probe was done for it even on a small scale and if it was done, why no action was taken about it and what happened to those lists. Many of those voters have had to re-register themselves this elections.\n\nAnother questionable thing this elections in the Mumbai is its timings. The elections in Mumbai are on Monday 29th April. In an city which has one, high amount of working and salaried as well as business class, a lot of whom which are Modi supporters, there cannot be more wrong date for voting. There are holidays on Saturday the 27th, Sunday the 28th, Monday the 29th the voting day and 1st May which is celebrated as Maharastra day in the state of Maharashtra. This means, majority of the city public, a lot of them supporters of the ruling BJP, would be out of the city on outstation places for a few days, especially during the voting phase of the city and thereby not be able to vote. Did EC knew about this and did it purposely set these dates or did it simply not care about it.\n\n\nThe only place where EC and the government stand side by side is on the issue of EVMs and the idea that fair elections should be conducted, something which that opposition has not left alone and has exploited.\n\nAll these questions are not allegations, but questions which ask whether EC is really outright incompetent it just plain anti-Modi or anti-BJP in their work and actions by them."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'bi77ts'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bi77ts/is_the_ec_incompetent_or_biased_against_modi/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'WHY did the 2012 Delhi gang rape receive SO MUCH international coverage? EXPLAINED!'<br />Body: 'As explained in my previous post, a woman is raped every **6.2 minutes** in America. In Britain, **half the women** surveyed claim to have suffered sexual assault or rape at least once in their lives. Similar stats are seen all across the English speaking colonialist "Anglosphere". \n\nThe coverage of the 2012 Delhi gang rape was so *peculiar* in it\'s persistence - a drawn out, weeks-long media campaign, with a film coming at the end. Simply put, it was a colossal hit job on India\'s ruling government, and India as a country. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapes happen all across the world - and at a greater rate in the West itself - so why pick **this** one in particular and highlight it as such an ENORMOUS issue? Why so much coverage?\n\nHere is my explanation for why it received the amount of coverage it did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn early 2012, India\'s government did two things that pissed off the British IMMENSELY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.\n\nIndia refused to give Britain a fighter jet contract worth £12 billion pounds. The contract went to the French. This was a HUGE loss for British manufacturing. \n\nFor those unaware, Britain is a predominantly service based economy. They don\'t make much of anything anymore. \n\nWhat they do make however, is fighter jets. Their biggest and most prized project, was the Eurofighter Typhoon. \n\nThen British PM, David Cameron, took a massive delegation to India and lobbied HARD for the Eurofighter deal. He failed.\n\nThe consequences were significant:\n\nJob losses followed - as many as 5000 per unofficial reports - and worst of all, Cameron\'s government took a HAMMERING from opposition MPs, who claimed he wasn\'t doing enough to protect British jobs and industry. \n\nThe French, having "won" the contract, celebrated and mocked Britain\'s "destroyed" manufacturing industry. \n\nCameron, and Britain, were humiliated and the media was outraged. \n\nMore British businesses would fail in India, leading British media to ask: **What does India want**? [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9064112/What-does-India-want-from-Britain.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9064112/What-does-India-want-from-Britain.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. \n\nFiring criticisms of "ingratitude" at its "former colony", Britain\'s media repeatedly pointed out the "Aid" (read: bribes) given to the Indian government. WE GAVE YOU SO MUCH AID!! AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY US?\n\nIndia defended its decision.\n\nThen Finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, claimed the "aid" from Britain was peanuts. \n\nMore importantly, the Indian government, in a leaked memo - went on to dismiss the need for aid - **for reasons that EVERY indian can relate to**: it\'s portrayal of India. \n\nHere\'s a quote from the foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, *"we are not to avail of any DFID (British) assistance because of negative publicity of Indian poverty by the DFID".* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBritain justified it\'s aid by claiming that it wasn\'t merely a "bribe" to win figher jet contract, but a necessity for "alleviating poverty and addressing social issues".\n\nBut at this point, nobody was believing Britain. Their reputation was in the gutter. \n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOW could the British government bounce back from this? HOW could they prevent another humiliation? HOW could they protect Britain\'s economic interests in India? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBritain had to change tactics - and it needed to have a stronger political presence in India. "Aid" efforts were re-directed. From now on, Britain wouldn\'t give "aid" to governments or political parties. \n\nIt would start a group of NGOs - smaller, independent organizations that could mobilize masses and engage in strategic litigation when necessary. \n\nBut NGOs can\'t exist for no reason. They need to justify their existence by having a social cause to fight for. Indians were no longer interested in being told take "aid" for just being "poor". Britain needed a new pretext to start NGOs, a new cause. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater that year, a girl was raped on a bus in Delhi. \n\nBritain struck gold. They found a cause. Women\'s rights. Rape. Raperaperaperaperaperaperape. You don\'t want our aid? Well, we\'ll just label you all as rapists and weaken your government on the pretext of fighting for "women\'s rights". Then we\'ll see if you\'re able to make any strong, bi-partisan decisions. \n\nAnd so, we had non-stop coverage of the Delhi gang rape by the BBC. Britains "allies" joined in, and it became international news. For weeks. An angry Britain had retaliated, and retaliated HARD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here\'s the good news. Could India ever have a strong government again? Yes they could. And they got one in 2014. This new government began raiding each and every British NGO through its 5 years in office. Today, Britain\'s "aid" to India is literally peanuts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich "social issue" will the western world use next? Your guess is as good as mine. But this is what India is up against.'<br />Author: 'twatavious'  id: 'bhiw8u'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bhiw8u/why_did_the_2012_delhi_gang_rape_receive_so_much/</li>

Occasionally, a case [involving](http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/16/kobe-bryant-rape-eagle-colorado-ray-lewis/) a [celebrity](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/05/opinion/granderson-rihanna-brown/index.html) or [lurid details](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2232923/Rihannas-battered-face-featured-Chris-Brown-concert-posters-singer-targeted-anti-domestic-violence-campaign.html)  in a particular case get a lot of attention in the media, but such  cases are treated as anomalies, while the abundance of incidental news  **items about violence against women in this country, in other countries,  on every continent including** [**Antarctica**](http://www.wisenet-australia.org/issue64/Women%20in%20ANARE.htm)**, constitute a kind of background wallpaper for the news.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have an abundance of rape and violence against women in this  country and on this Earth, though it’s almost never treated as a civil  rights or human rights issue, or a crisis, or even a pattern. **Violence  doesn’t have a race, a class, a religion or a nationality, but it does  have a gender.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those are all exceptional crimes, but we could also talk about quotidian assaults, because though a rape is [reported](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/50-facts-rape_b_2019338.html) only every 6.2 minutes in this country, the estimated total is perhaps [five times as high](http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/amroul20122.pdf).  **Which means that there may be very nearly a rape a minute in the United  States. It all adds up to tens of millions of rape victims.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://www.thenation.com/article/rape-minute-thousand-corpses-year/](https://www.thenation.com/article/rape-minute-thousand-corpses-year/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to admit, this was pretty eye opening. A woman is raped every 6.2 minutes in America. It\'s unbelievable. And these are the reported ones. It\'s incredible. Objectively speaking, America is rape capital of the world:\n\n[**https://i.imgur.com/nK1Pt7c.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/nK1Pt7c.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe larger discussion to be had is over the politicization of rape. Does politicizing rape as a region or nation specific problem actually address the issue of rape? \n\nMany - especially our secularist friends in india - would argue that America and the WEST - treats women "better" than India. \n\nBut while this line of argument could be used to win a political debate, does it actually address the issue faced by women all across the world? To this, i ask:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould the issue of rape be related to a civilization\'s societal values? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe west is a judeo-christian society. Judeo-christian scripture and it\'s corresponding values refuse to view women as equals, and actively support the use of rape: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rape-culture-god-and-the-bible\\_b\\_2473284](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rape-culture-god-and-the-bible_b_2473284)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDharma, from my knowledge, has a better moral positioning - as women, like all living beings, are deified and the dharmic existence requires a respect for nature. Correct me if i\'m wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if the solution to rape isn\'t western governance or western values - as women continue to be raped every 6.2 minutes there - could dharma provide the solution? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the world had more dharmic people than judeo-christian-islamic believers, would there be fewer rapes?

The announcement of the results of the Intermediate exams (Class 11 and Class 12 under the state board, overseen by the state government) in Telangana last Thursday has led to utter chaos.\n\n &gt; What are the issues?\n\n &gt; As soon as the results were announced, the first issue that came to light was that many bright students who did well in the first year failed in the second year. Most of them were shocked as they were awarded zero, one or two marks.\n\n &gt; One of the biggest blunders involved G Navya, a student from Mancherial district, who was shocked to see zero marks on her Telugu paper. She was one of the district toppers with 98 marks in the same subject in the first year. When a leading Telugu daily carried her story, the BIE officials swung into action and after re-verification gave her 99 marks. But not everyone's grievances were addressed so quickly.\n\n &gt; Some students who appeared for their exam were also marked as 'absent' or 'fail' in their final results.\n\n &gt; Many of the students who have gathered at the TSBIE headquarters say that they unable to apply for re-evaluation because the TSBIE website is not functioning. The board, meanwhile, is barring students from entering their office, and insists that online application is the only way.\n\n---------\n\n- [16 have ended their life, show some concern: High Court.

Janardhan Reddy and Intermediate Board Secretary Ashok. The Bench said their submissions were lethargic and bureaucratic. \n\n &gt; “Prima facie there are lacunae on the part of the Intermediate Board, which conceded that there were some mistakes in the declaration of results,” the Bench noted.\n\n &gt; It made it clear that every student has a right to know the assessment of his/her performance in the exams. The future of the students depends on their respective scores in Inter exams. Hence, the authorities should work hard to re-evaluate the answer sheets at the earliest, the Bench said. “When the judges can work till 3 a.m., why not the officials,” asked the ACJ.\n\n--------\n- [20 Commit Suicide in Telangana After Intermediate Results, KCR Waives Off Re-evaluation Fee.](https://www.news18.com/news/politics/kcr-pulls-up-education-minister-over-intermediate-suicides-waives-off-re-evaluation-fee-2116045.html) \n\n- [Protests over Telangana intermediate results continue: Students, guardians demand re-evaluation, suspension of board secretary](https://www.firstpost.com/india/protests-over-telangana-intermediate-results-continue-students-guardians-demand-re-evaluation-suspension-of-board-secretary-6513361.html)\n\n- [Section 144 imposed at Charminar](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/250419/section-144-imposed-at-charminar.html)\n\n- [Student suicides in Telangana: Spurred by broken system, sustained by govt apathy.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/student-suicides-telangana-spurred-broken-system-sustained-govt-apathy-100607)\n\n- [Telangana intermediate results row: Norms flouted to award contract to technical firm?

The answer is because of humans emotional attachment to the animal. Many people keep dogs and cats as pets and adore them. This emotional attachment results in an outpouring of sentiment against the practice. You may or may not agree that the reason is right but you can understand and even empathise with the point of view of these people.\n\nNow coming to cows historically there has been similar attachment with cows. You can still see the sentiment alive in rural areas and urban India is mostly detached from it. Things even get more complicated when you realise that Hindus not only worship cows but revere and respect it. You may again be an atheist or a person from another religion and mock this practice as dogma. Every religion is based on dogma but cow worshiping isn\'t just dogma. Cows are worshipped in Hinduism not because of just some blind belief that they are holy though it is part of it. Cows are worshipped because they give more than they take. For years rural life has been dependent on cows for 3 Fs, food, fuel and fertilizer making rural life a whole lot of sustainable. I still remember when ever I used to visit my nanaka and my Nani used to live in a kaccha house at that time. The walls and floor were coated with cow dung and she use to regularly recoat it. She used to cook for me using cow dung as a fuel the food grown by using cow dung as a fertilizer. All along with that ghee and paneer made from the milk of cow. Can you imagine how much of life was dependent on cows in rural areas? Cow worshipping goes beyond dogma, it truly is appreciation of an animal for all its done for us. It gives gives and gives.\n\nThough times have change and we should change our lifestyle with us but why shouldn\'t we still not venerate the cow is beyond me. It\'s true that we urban people have not grown up with such situation and we don\'t know the value of cow as an animal but does that give us the right to dismiss these as mere dogma. We have no right to mock them for।loving cows just because we had the good fortune of not living in such a situation. This is creeping elitism and should be called out whenever possible.\n\nAnd still the religious significance cannot be understated too. I feel reading the comments of both left and right wing people a sense of shame that comes being attached to the tag \'cow worshipers\'. I don\'t understand why this is there, it\'s part of Hinduism whether you like it or not. Why is there shame about it? Why do you think it is inferior to worship cows that has sustained our civilization for thousands of years and it\'s superior to worship an imaginary guy in the sky. I myself am an Hindu Agnostic, I don\'t know if there is a god up there but I am more than happy to worship cow, something that nourishes us and I am proud to do so. And if you are confident in your faith and position you should be also defend it.\n\nNext issue is that of cow lynching. I agree completely people shouldn\'t take law into their own hands and killing people is wrong. No way around it, what is wrong is wrong. But looking at it as an evidence of Hindu fundamentalism is wrong too. Cow lynching isn\'t  result of hindutva taking hold as left have you believe it\'s। a result of years of systematic oppression and discrimination against Hindus which has been institutionalised. I have already elaborated how much cows are revered in India, and how central it is to our view of religion, but the repeated failure of state and central government to protect cows has resulted in this violence. Rather than what you believe smuggling cows from parts of Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and UP is a major thing. The meat mafia in India itself is worth a $5 billion industry. Yes you read that right $5 billion. And the repeated failure of successive governments to defend the religious rights of Hindus are in front of you. Still even after repeated complaints by Hindus against this no concrete action has been taken by so called secular government. The same government that are quick to ban books and cartoons that insult Islam are dead silent about Hindu complaints. I don\'t believe this is secularism. It\'s a mockery of secularism. Even more sad is the fact that despite being an important issue many left wing urbans are quick to dismiss and mock it, on the other side many right wing urbans are unwilling and ashamed to raise this issue. \n\nAnd then it becomes an issue of Hindu fundamentalism. The media is quick to paint this as Hindu Vs Muslim issue without giving a closer look. I agree that death of any person is unfortunate and shouldn\'t take palace but the way media handles these issues sickens me to the core. Only when the victims of lynching are Muslims then it gets coverage and there is just a passing mention of Hindus being killed in such lynching. Do Hindu lives don\'t matter at all? Is that low value of life of a Hindu? And then they say "Is India becoming more intolerant?",  no you moron this means the situation is so bad that people feel more compelled to take action.\n\nThose intellectuals left or right who swear by the constitution balantly ignore the clause in state directives to call for cow protection. State directives are the clauses which the makers of constitution believed would make a more just society. So why ignore this cow issue? What are you ashamed of discussing it with people? Not considering this an issue is not only elitist thinking but an ignorance of religious sentiments of majority of Indian people.'<br />Author: 'srthk'  id: 'bgqdb9'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bgqdb9/in_defence_of_cows/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Shame of Bengal'<br />Body: '# [The Shame of Bengal](https://theemissary.co/the-shame-of-bengal/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe region of Bengal has been at one of the most forward thinking areas of the Indian subcontinent. It gave birth to various ***philosophers, reformers, and revolutionaries*** during the British Raj as well as the Indian Independence movement. But things started shifting as Bengal suffered heavily from British imperialism and subsequently partition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBengal was separated by a bloody partition into West Bengal (India) and East Pakistan. In 1971, a civil war broke out between West Pakistan and East Pakistan. West Bengal was swarmed with refugees causing India to intervene and ***decisively defeat Pakistan and liberate East Pakistan*** \\- birthing the new nation of Bangladesh.\n\n### Red Terror\n\nBut for this story, we will focus on West Bengal. While Bangladesh was being born, West Bengal fell into the control of communists. These communists enacted policies that would ***exacerbate the damages of the British colonialism,*** which destroyed Bengal. Even as recent as 2007, [11% of families in West Bengal faced starvation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/left-rules-west-bengal-for-34-years-and-ruins-the-state/articleshow/8382473.cms?from=mdr) \\- a grim callback to the Churchill engineered Bengal Famine. In addition to economic policies, the communists would make it a point to destroy as much of West Bengal\'s Hindu heritage as possible. Media and academia were the chosen mediums. \n\nFor them, ***Communism had become the one true religion, and Marx was the one true God.*** \n\nCommunist rule in West Bengal took a page out of the manual of communist dictatorship. Communist cadres would brutally oppress the populace with violence reminiscent of their beloved flag. Loyalists would be rewarded with "redistributed" land and wealth, while ***dissenters would meet the hammer and sickle.*** Spies were recruited to keep localities in check and booth capturing was common place come election time. Does any of this ***sound familiar?***\n\n### The Bengali Tigress\n\nMamata Banerjee grew up in this environment and faced it head on. Her skull was cracked open protesting against the CPM, and she earned a reputation as a "street fighter" in Bengal. She would end up leading the Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) to topple the 35 year reign of the communists in 2011. Mamata attained victory with a "fight fire with fire" type of mentality. However, she would soon ***burn with the same flames that she sought to extinguish.***\n\nDuring her earlier rebellious years, Mamata fought tooth and nail against communist policies such as allowing Bangladeshi illegal immigration, appeasement politics, and the base brutality of the communists. With her rise, she would soon whole heartedly embrace these tactics to establish a solid vote bank among Bengali Muslims and calcify her control with violence. Luckily, she has not so much taken on the communist\'s love for far-left economic ideals that crippled West Bengal for years.\n\nHer strategy can be summarized in general by:\n\n* **Minority Appeasement**\n* **Abuse of Federalism**\n* **Control by Violence**\n\nIn many ways, Mamata has outdone the communists in their transgressions. \n\n### Some Are More Equal Than Others\n\nBengal is deep seated in the indigenous Dharmic traditions of India. Hindu Epics mention the land frequently and Buddha preached around the western half of Bengal. Great Hindu reformers such as Vivekanand, Paramhansa Yogananda, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, etc... formed the ***bedrock of the*** [***Bengali Renaissance***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Renaissance) \\- a movement that rapidly progressed Bengal culturally, artistically, and scientifically in the 19th century. Prior to that, Islamic rule had a profound effect on Bengal as many converted due to missionaries, coercion, and unfortunate violence. With the partition, old wounds were reopened, and the state was divided along religious lines.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day - the people were distinctly Bengali. Bangladeshis had been horribly discriminated against and killed during their unity with Pakistan simply because West Pakistanis viewed Bengali culture as inferior and "Hindu." Therefore unity naturally developed amongst Bengalis across the borders. Bangladeshis started to migrate to West Bengal in search of work and better opportunities. Culturally, it was easy as many of the traditions, language, and mannerisms were the same.\n\nUnfortunately, identities clash and old Hindu-Muslim tensions started to arise. \n\nNow here\'s a common theme amongst Left or "secular" parties in India that you\'ll see happen in West Bengal: \n\n1. **Consolidate a minority vote by fear-mongering and/or appeasement (Cash doles to religious places/schools/reservations)**\n2. **Divide Hindus by caste/regional/ethnic differences**\n3. **With a combined vote share of minorities + certain aggrieved Hindu castes, victory is assured**\n4. **Solidify victory by investing through appeasement/favoritism for your vote share groups**\n\nDivide and rule has been perfected in India. ***The British Raj would be proud.***\n\nBut let\'s get to the meat of the issue. Heres a list of the [minority appeasement](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/politics-of-appeasement-boomerangs-in-bengal) laid out by Mamata Banerjee:\n\n* **Cash grants to mosques, madrassas, and imams (while giving less or none to Hindu equivalents)**\n* **Blocking or delaying of Hindu festivals (the Durga Puja being the most prominent recently) to allow Islamic festivals to be celebrated**\n* **Blind eye and even accusations of encouragement of illegal Bangladeshi immigration to grow her vote bank**\n\nThis is a pure mockery of secularism. Hindus and Muslims should be treated equally by the government. Hindus and Muslims should celebrate festivals together in peace and merriment. \n\nIdeally Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, etc... should all live in harmony and togetherness with equal laws and equal treatment by the state. But minority appeasement is an institutional foundation that encourages enmity between groups. It is a ***root cause of communal tension*** and something that has been the roti and sabzi of Left parties in India. \n\nNow the last point of illegal immigration leads us to another plank of Mamata\'s strategy - Bengali Chauvinism.\n\n### Bengali Chauvinism\n\nMamata Banerjee has cleverly made an undercurrent of hyper-Bengali pride attached to herself. She projects herself has a protector of Bengali interests versus the "fascist" central Indian state that seeks to undermine and dilute Bengali culture. \n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with being proud of one\'s region/state in India, it is a frequent strategy of regional leaders to stoke antipathy towards foreigners in their state. The combination of regional pride + socialist measures has proved a powerful bulwark against large central parties like the BJP and Congress.\n\nMamata emphasizes Bengali-ness over everything else in her blind eye towards Bangladeshi immigration. She holds West Bengal as a ***bastion of "secularism"*** even though it has seen [frequent communal incidents](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/communal-violence-cases-up-in-bengal-home-ministry/article23385683.ece) during her rule.\n\nBut beyond this regional pride, lies something more sinister - ***a brazen abuse of federalism.***\n\nIndia\'s federalism is arguably one of the most balanced systems. State governments can refuse central programs and have large amounts of autonomy. However Mamata has crossed the lines of this autonomy recently.\n\nWhile the central government has sought to curb illegal immigration, Mamata has encouraged it. She has even refused citizenship registries to track these illegals and deemed it as an attack on Bengali pride. Her attacks have extended to other states such a Assam and Tripura where illegal Bangladeshi immigration has changed the traditionally tribal demographics of the state. Mamata has criticized both of these states for trying to maintain their fragile traditions and culture against a ***broken faucet of immigration*** from Bangladesh.\n\nWhen the BJP tried to launch political campaigns in Bengal, Mamata Banerjee blocked their "rath yatra" and even helicopter transport for the Uttar Pradesh CM. Imagine a Republican governor blocking Democratic campaigning in the USA and the subsequent and rightful outrage to follow it.\n\nEven worse was when the central government sent agents to investigate the Saradha scam of West Bengal. Mamata brazenly used her state forces to block CBI agents from investigating and obtaining documents related to her TMC cohorts. The CBI deemed this as a [***"constitutional anarchy"*** ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/saradha-chit-fund-scamconstitutional-anarchy-in-bengal-cbi-tells-sc/articleshow/68640058.cms)and gross abuse of power. Again, Mamata Banerjee sought the refuge of federalism and Bengali pride. \n\nBut of course, this brutish use of state machinery to fulfill political aims doesn\'t just end at the offices; it occurs right at the doorstep of many Bengalis - ***through violence.***\n\n### Trial By One Way Combat\n\nI criticize the Western media\'s coverage of India frequently. But this may be the trend that disgusts me the most. Outlets such as the BBC, Washington Post, New York Times, etc... have maintained more or less ***pin-drop silence over the outright and brutal violence*** that Mamata Banerjee has unleashed on West Bengal.\n\nEven worse, this is all part of a broad trend of violence amongst left/secular parties in India as [Left-Wing Terror is the leading cause](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9d36SIUwAMxvSJ.jpg) of terrorism in India. \n\nIn the first [few phases of the Indian Elections,](https://swarajyamag.com/insta/west-bengal-panchayat-polls-protesters-block-road-in-south-24-paraganas-after-tmc-activists-capture-booth) the TMC has lynched BJP workers, stopped Hindus from casting votes, and captured polling booths to make sure the citizens vote for TMC. This is all part of a congruent mentality that has gripped Bengal since the communist era. Mamata is carrying on the tradition.\n\nHer rule in Bengal has seen scores of BJP workers and associates murdered, raped, and assaulted with virtual silence from the international mainstream media. Images and videos of TMC violence have leaked onto social media during her rule to showcase the brutality that [BJP party members face regularly.](https://swarajyamag.com/insta/west-bengal-a-month-after-two-bjp-workers-were-found-hanging-another-party-worker-found-dead)\n\nHow can India call itself the world\'s largest democracy when such thuggery is abundant in its 4th largest state? How can the media be silent on this ***outlandish mockery of democracy?*** Even central institutions such as the Election Commission of India have been twiddling their thumbs on the rampant abuses of polling while reducing their duty to banning movies and censuring communal remarks post facto.\n\nNon-TMC parties face an uphill battle in West Bengal. State machinery and media apathy provide large obstacles in the mission of democracy.

DEPONENT\n\nAFFIDAVIT\n\nI, Utsav Singh Bains, the Deponent, do hereby solemnly state and affirm as under:\n\n1. That I am a practicing advocate at the Supreme Court of India and being familiar with the facts and circumstances of the case, I am competent to swear this Affidavit.\n2. That, the Deponent wishes to bring to notice of the Hon’ble Court a serious matter of a conspiracy to make the Chief Justice of India resign by framing him in a false case of sexual harassment.\n3. That at around 5 pm on 4thApril 2019, an unknown person came to meet the Deponent at his office. \n4. That, the person named himself Ajay and claimed to be a relative of a lady who has since become a complainant against the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India (CJI).\n5. That, the person said that he wanted the Deponent to pro-bono represent the said complainant who had made allegations of sexual harassment against the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India. The said Ajay told the Deponent that he approached the Deponent as the Deponent has appeared for sexual assault survivors on a pro-bono basis in the past and that he had seen the Deponent appear on television during many television debates regarding sexual abuse of children and women.\n6. That, the said Ajay narrated in Hindi language that the said complainant was working as a staff member of the Hon’ble CJI and alleged that the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India had sexually assaulted her at his residence. \n7. That, the said Ajay further claimed that the Hon’ble CJI had persecuted the said complainant and her family. The said Ajay wanted the Deponent to pro-bono represent the said complainant as her lawyer and organize a press conference at the Press Club of India to make those allegations public. \n8. That, the person then praised the Deponent’s pro-bono work as a lawyer for the survivors of sexual assault in high-profile cases.\n9. That the Deponent was shocked to hear the allegations and was willing to represent the said complainant but when the said Ajay further narrated the entire sequence of events and facts of the case, the Deponent was not convinced and found several loopholes in the said Ajay’s version of events.\n10. That, when the Deponent asked the said Ajay to arrange a meeting with the said complainant, the said Ajay offered to organize a Vakalatnama and affidavit signed by the said complainant. However, the said Ajay was neither prepared to bring the complainant to the office of the Deponent nor to connect her to the Deponent to answer material questions.\n11. That, when the Deponent asked the said Ajay as to what was his relationship with the said complainant, the said Ajay gave evasive and vague responses.\n12. That, the interaction between the Deponent and the said Ajay made it clear to the said Ajay that the Deponent was not interested to represent the said complainant without directly meeting with her as the Deponent was not convinced and found several loopholes in the said Ajay’s version of events. It was then that the said Ajay changed his track suddenly and from a request for a pro-bono representation, directly offered the Deponent a bribe of Rs 50 lakh to represent the said complainant and also to organize a press conference.\n13. That, when the Deponent outright refused the said bribe of Rs 50 lakh offered by the said Ajay to frame the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, the said Ajay then increased the sum to Rs 1.5 crore to the Deponent following which the Deponent asked him to immediately leave his office.\n14. That, the Deponent then met various reliable persons to enquire about the allegations, who gave the Deponent credible information on the condition of anonymity. That, these are listed herein-below.\n15. That, the Deponent was informed by reliable sources that certain ‘Fixers’, who claim to be engaged in illegally managing Judgements in exchange for cash are behind this plot as the Hon’ble CJI has taken decisive action to crack down on such fixers.\n16. That, in the beginning of the Deponent’s informal enquiry, every source the Deponent met had only the knowledge of a conspiracy against the Hon’ble CJI but not the names of the persons involved in hatching and executing the said conspiracy.\n17. That on 19thApril, 2019, a very reliable person, strictly on the condition of anonymity and in good faith, informed the Deponent about a corporate figure who tried to approach a Hon’ble Supreme Court judge to get a favourable order in a high-profile case listed before this Hon’ble Court but was unsuccessful and then the said corporate figure attempted to get the case transferred from the court of that Hon’ble Supreme Court judge but did not succeed and thus ganged up with an alleged fixer by the name of Romesh Sharma and his aides to frame the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India in a false case of sexual harassment to pressurize him to resign. \n18. That the person further informed the Deponent that after targeting the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, the Hon’ble Supreme Court judge mentioned above is the next target of this gang of Fixers and the above mentioned Corporate figure and will be soon framed in a controversy to force him to resign as well because the above mentioned Corporate figure incurred huge losses due to the Judgement passed by the above mentioned Hon’ble Supreme Court judge.\n19. That, the source told the Deponent that Romesh Sharma also ganged up with disgruntled employees and former employees of the Supreme Court, who actively conspired to frame the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India in the sexual harassment complaint.\n20. That it is pertinent to mention here that the Deponent is privy to certain events involving the said corporate figure and will submit in a sealed cover the events and list of the involved persons to this Hon’ble Court should it so direct him. \n21. That the deponent was further informed by the person about the failed attempts of Jet Airways owner Naresh Goyal to bribe the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India through the said fixer Romesh Sharma to give a favorable order to Jet Airways and to order the Government to waive off its losses.\n22. That, the same source stated that the said fixer Romesh Sharma was introduced to Naresh Goyal by 1993 Bombay Bomb Blast Mastermind and United Nations Security Council designated Terrorist Dawood Ibrahim. \n23. That the source showed the Deponent credible and incriminating reports by Indian Intelligence agencies proving that Dawood Ibrahim had invested money in Jet Airways and that the Delhi based Romesh Sharma was a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim.\n24. That, It is also pertinent to mention here, that the Deponent further enquired into the claims and found the story to be true and secret documents of Intelligence agencies in custody of some Delhi-based journalists, which clearly establish that Dawood Ibrahim had invested huge sum of money in the Jet Airways.\n25. That, the Deponent was further informed that the said fixer Romesh Sharma was running a ‘Cash for Judgement’ racket in cahoots with businessmen and politicians and had exercised considerable influence for years, which ultimately was brought to an end by the present Chief Justice of India when he took over the office and took decisive actions against such Fixers. \n26. That furthermore the reliable source informed the Deponent that Romesh Sharma had hatched this conspiracy along with other Fixers like him and he was the Delhi Kingpin of the ‘Cash for Judgement Fixers Club’.\n27. That, the Deponent was informed that the said fixer Romesh Sharma wanted the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India to resign as he was facing huge losses worth hundreds of crores since he was unable to get favorable orders for the highest bidder.\n28. That, on 19 April 2019, when the Deponent was informed by a reliable source about the links of Romesh Sharma with Dawood Ibrahim and Naresh Goyal and the above mentioned Corporate Figure, the Deponent realized that the conspiracy was of a very serious nature and felt it is his duty as an Officer of the Court under the Advocates Act to inform the Hon’ble CJI of the conspiracy.\n29. That, the Deponent upon learning about the said links of the said fixer Romesh Sharma with Naresh Goyal and Dawood Ibrahim and the above mentioned Corporate Figure and understanding the larger conspiracy to frame the Hon’ble CJI, immediately rushed to the residence of the Chief Justice of India, and reached outside the Hon’ble CJI’s residence around 7 pm on 19thApril, 2019. The Deponent did not know any other avenue of approaching the Hon’ble CJI nor who else to approach considering the sensitivity of the matter.\n30. That, the Deponent requested the staff of the Hon’ble CJI for an audience with the Hon’ble CJI but they told the Deponent that the Hon’ble CJI was not at his residence.\n31. That, the Deponent later during the same evening contacted a Supreme Court reporter and asked him to get a message sent to Hon’ble CJI or arrange a meeting and asked him to meet him the next day. \n32. That on the next day, viz 20thApril 2019, the Deponent read media reports about the allegations made against the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India.\n33. That, the Deponent has filed this affidavit in the capacity of being an Officer of the Court under the Advocates Act as well as a conscientious citizen of the country.\n34. That, the Deponent will not share any names of the sources mentioned herein under any circumstances as these were Privileged Communications under the Advocates Act.\n35. That, the Deponent is aware that his life will come under imminent danger after filing of this affidavit due to the established connections of Romesh Sharma and Naresh Goyal with Dawood Ibrahim.\n36. That the Deponent has been informed that he might be killed in a planned road accident or poisoned by untraceable poison or killed in a way that the murder will look like a plain accident or be framed in a false case of Rape etcetera to tarnish his image by those who will be hurt by the Deponent for speaking the truth and exposing them. \n37. That the Deponent is filing this affidavit in the larger interest of the Judiciary and for its independence. \n38. That the Deponent will find it an honor to suffer any consequences in the larger interest of the Judiciary’s independence but will not disclose the names of the true patriots who have shared the information in good faith and under strict confidence on promise of confidentiality.\n39. That the chain of events and the information learnt by the Deponent has led the Deponent to believe that the independence of the Judiciary is today under a very serious attack and that the sexual harassment complaint is a organized conspiracy against the Chief Justice of India to force him to resign and thereby threaten every Judge with dire consequences for being free and fearless in dispensing Justice while pronouncing Judgements against the rich and powerful in the country. \n40. That the Deponent affirms that the Deponent has no personal, pecuniary or professional interest in this matter whatsoever.\n\n41. That the Deponent has limited resources and has conducted whatsoever enquiry that was possible as an Officer of the Court under the Advocates Act and states that no relevant facts in his knowledge have been withheld except the information mentioned in para 17 hereinabove which will be submitted in a sealed cover If so directed by this Hon’ble Court.\n\n42. That the Deponent has through this affidavit passed on whatever information was made available to him from various reliable sources so as to provide a larger picture to this Hon’ble Court.\n\n43. That the Deponent has tried to the best of his ability to verify the said information made available to him by the various sources mentioned herinabove.\n\n44. That the Deponent merely wishes that all of the information should come to the knowledge of this Hon’ble Court so that it can have the same probed and the independence of the Judiciary be protected under all circumstances.\n\n45. That the matter is of a sensitive nature and cannot be probed by any subordinate agency without direct judicial supervision since it concerns the independence of the Judiciary and directly relates to a conspiracy to undermine the topmost office in the Indian judiciary.\n\n46. That keeping this in mind, the deponent did not approach any investigating agency with these details but has approached this Hon’ble Court in good faith so that it may be probed without fear, favour or pressure of any kind.\n\n47. That, an Independent Judicial Enquiry is the need of the hour in this case.\n\nDEPONENT\n\nVERIFICATION:\nI, the above named Deponent, do hereby verify that the contents of the above Affidavit comprising in Para No 1 to 47, are true and correct to my knowledge, thatno part of it is false and that nothing material has been concealed therefrom.\n\nVerified at New Delhi on this 22nd dayof April 2019.\n\n\nDEPONENT”'<br />Author: 'MediumAdhesiveness5'  id: 'bg5bke'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bg5bke/affidavit_of_one_utsav_bhains_who_claims_he_was/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bengal and Bangladesh - A Cultural Connection'<br />Body: "**Namaste IndiaSpeaks**\n\nI have noticed several community members are quite worked up over Bengal (West Bengal)'s romance with Bangladesh and Islam. Often we see posts that trash Mamata, TMC and in general the bengali muslim community.\n\nI am sure you've wondered, like myself, as to why this is happening. Apart from the superficial things we read in the news, not much is known to most of us.\n\n------------------\n\nI happen to interact with a lot (like a real lot) of Bangaladeshis in Australia and some of them are relatively close. Ofcourse, all of them are, by virtue of origin, Muslim. \n\n#Identity:\n\nThe thing is, for the bengali on both sides of the border, it is more a **Bengali** identity rather than a religious one per se. \n\n* Bangladesh and Bengal share a lot of ethnic identity - like they like each other's Musicians, artists and writers. \n\n* Bangladeshis dance to Indian as well as their own musical numbers, and vice versa.\n\n* Shopping, like for marriages, are much cheaper in India for a Bangladeshi, than in their own country. (Which also means, Indian Bengal gets a lot of business from Bangladeshi travelers)\n\n* It takes about 4 weeks to get an Indian Visa, and the most visited destination is Kolkata for shopping and other events.\n\n* A lot of Bengali awards - be it for music, art or literature are given for **Good Bengali works**, irrespective of nationality. \n\n* I have several Bengali friends or classmates who have come to Kolkata to receive awards and travel north of India as tourists. Awards are given as early as High school levels. \n\n* These awards and accolades are for promoting the Bengali identity. \n\n* There is significant goodwill towards India due to '71, but more so with Bengal for Bengali. Well, since Muslim Bangladesh fought Muslim Pakistan for freedom just to assert their bengali identity. Now, their only civilizational brother (so to speak) in the entire world is Bengal. \n\n* Bangladesh does expose itself greatly into other aspects of Indian culture - like Bollywood, South Indian Cinema, sports, etc - but for the Bangaladeshi - the path to India always goes through Kolkata and the Bengali heartlands.\n\n* IMO, the closest thing one can compare to the thirst of their (both Bengal + Bangladesh)'s bengali identity is the Tamil in TN or Punjabi in Punjab, but just a little less noisy and nuanced. \n\n* If one were to observe between the lines, their assertion for that identity is as much passionate as the above two others, if not more. You must realize that Bengali is one of the highest spoken languages in the region after Hindi (much ahead of Punjabi or Tamil). \n\n* Their tryst for identity is relative quite, and yet much more crazy.\n\n#Politics: \n\n* This is one of the reasons, perhaps, entities like CPI(m) was so successful in Bengal - among other stuff, it overlooked religious aspects\n\n* Muslims will remain a votebank for a long time in India, and anyone who wants to win an election most easily needs to best secure the united voter - and in Bengal, getting the Muslim Bengali voter is easiest by currying favor and 'uniting' muslims culturally from both sides of the border.\n\n* Muslims have a double Identity attachment, One of Culture, and second of Religion (again culture). \n\n* Giving more concessions to Bangaladeshi Muslims, will win favor of Indian Muslims as it would be seen as their **Bengali** + **Muslim** brothers are being favored. \n\n* This and most other things you are already aware of, ration card, Madrassa funding from Saudi, etc. \n\n* Hindus still cling more to the Bengali identity rather than the Religious one - as that is still the only uniting factor (there are not many Hindus left in Bangaldesh anyway)\n\n* The current Bangladeshi PM is Pro India, and less religious than the predecessor.\n\n* This is also to a reasonable extent true for Assam, Meghalaya where Bengali is the one of the next most widely spoken language.\n\n#Take Away and Conclusions:\n\n* If one were to win hearts in Bengal - it is best to go the culture route rather than the religious one. \n\n* There will be less takers for a Hindu / hindi Identity in Bengal if it is severed from the Bengali identity. \n\n* On the other hand, any campaign that is soaked in Bangali identity would see less opposition from both sides of the border. \n\n* The connection of Bengal and Bangladesh due to cultural identity is more of mutual respect and admiration, as well as recognition.\n\n* The Indian (Bengali) politicians leaning on Bangladeshi people of fame or their Muslims is shooting two birds with one stone. \n\n* One thing that I see BJP (/ RSS) and Congress falter in bengal is because they overtly try to take Delhi to Bengal. \n\nYou don't.\n\nIf one celebrates Bengali in Bengal the right way, only then will Delhi ascend."<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'bg4ovz'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bg4ovz/bengal_and_bangladesh_a_cultural_connection/</li>

First some definitions \n\n* Extremism - Advocating extreme views for a doctrine \n* Fundamentalist - Advocating for literal or strict interpretation of scriptures \n* Radicalism - Advocating for views that are very different from the norm \n\nThe Quran , Hadiths and Sira form the trinity that are at the foundation of Islam . Using sira and hadiths , tafsirs have been made that explain the context of quran verses . \n\nIslamic tenets which originate from these foundational scriptures , \\*\\*orders the subjugation of kaffirs and allows them either become Dhimmi or corpse\\*\\* , this is supported by many verses , hadiths etc .   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo whenever we see a Islamic attack , I think it would be wrong to classify the terrorists as  radicals because they are following their doctrine obediently , and not breaking away from the doctrine . Thus Jihadis should be considered as "Islamic fundamentalist"\n\n Rather it would be interesting to note that \\*\\*peaceful Muslims would be considered as radicals\\*\\* from the point of view of Islam and Quran does call out such  muslims as munafiqun ( hypocrites ) who should be punished with death by  believers .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now thinking about it the attacker of Christ Church Mosque shooting , can\'t be considered as christian terrorist because he acted on his  idea of resistance against islam .

      <li>Title::: "FSM_vs_Cthulhu's Manifesto for IndiaSpeaks Council"<br />Body: 'Namaskar IndiaSpeaks! \n\nI am your candidate **fsm_vs_cthulhu**.\n\nMany of you will know me from here, and other sister-subs, and from the old days in the trenches of Rwandia. \n\nFor those that don\'t: Socially, I\'m a classical liberal forced to turn conservative by toxic pseudolibs, economically centrist-RoC (Right of Center), with a very strong Nationalist streak. I\'m a staunch Atheist, and a viraat Hindu/Dharmic. I am not Secular.\n\nI am also the hardworking resident tard-wrangler. Taking down trolls is a sport of sorts.\n\nHere\'s my manifesto for you lovely people of IndiSpeaks:\n\n* #Paki Trolls          \nIf you vote for me, I will ensure that any troll that\'s found to be a Larpistani (Paki troll) will get banned right away. This is IndiaSpeaks, not PakiPropagandaSpeaks\n\n* #Relaxing "not related to India"          \nI will lobby for maintaining low restrictions on "not related to India" removals and locking of posts, because user voting should decide what gets promoted or demoted in the sub. Many things are tangentially very relevant to India, and of deep interest to us. \n\n* #Unlocking popular posts         \nI will also make sure that any locked post that reaches ISpeaks frontpage will **have** to be unlocked, regardless of titling or whatever minor rules violations.\n\n* #Right-Wing and Centrist voices.         \nI will strongly support you guys. Since we are mostly refugees from the national sub, where else do we have to go? You can always come to me with any concerns you may have, and I will make sure that we find a good solution for them.\n\n* #On free speech:        \nI do not consider the regular abuses that are used in casual speech in India to be worthy of any kind of reprimand, removal, or ban. It\'s silly. Most of us are adults here. This is the internet. Having a bit of a thick skin is required. As for those people that become exceptionally vulgar, personal, and emotional - those comments should be removed.\n\n* #I will fight against the nuking of entire comment threads.            \nThis crap about *"both parties are equally responsible"* is a gross miscarriage of justice. It\'s like the idiotic policies that punish both, the Bully and the Victim. The primary aggressor (who engages in rule-breaking behavior) should be the only person who gets his comment removed, and any following warnings and punishments. Reactions to that behavior will be left untouched (the thread will collapse automatically, from the removed comment, onward).\n\n* #Regular trolls           \nIt\'s a difficult choice, because they prevent this sub from becoming a circlejerk. I believe in healthy debate, and some of them raise good points, and challenge us to do better, and to provide better arguments. I will vote against a rwandia-style \'purge\' of people from other perspectives. Users that regularly derail threads with irrelevant nonsense will be flaired as "Bait". I will, of course, continue to hunt them and frustrate them. \n\n* #Nationalism and Unity\nI believe strongly in national unity. I loathe petty regionalism, and language spats. I will take a VERY strong stance against the enemies within that seek to fracture us. I know how easy it is to slide down that slope, going from defending your people from generalizations, to making vile generalizations about others in retaliation. I have been goaded into doing it myself on occasion. It is terrible, and that will END. That means South vs North, Bihari vs Tamizhian, \'BIMARU\' vs Dravidian, Dalit vs Brahmin, Kerala vs Delhi, Hindi vs Kannada, all that racist stupid bullshit will be strongly punished (again, only the instigators/baiters). If the participants in any debate about regional differences and linguistics cannot remain objective and dispassionate, and discuss purely on the basis of merit, fact, and evidence, then they should refrain from participating. **ABSOLUTELY NO** making sweeping generalizations about things people had no choice in - their **place of birth, caste, mothertongue, complexion, wealth/poverty**. \n\n* #Maps and territorial integrity             \nI will remove any maps of India that violate our map laws, and that do not respect the territorial integrity of India. It is illegal and provides grounds for the entire sub to be blocked by the govt, and for people to be arrested. And it feeds the Chinese/Paki propaganda machine, which I will not allow. \n\n* #Ally of Bharatiya Josh Party             \nWe have formed NDA (National Dharmic Alliance). A pre-poll alliance. Users are advised to vote tactically.\n\n#My pledge: I will not allow this sub to turn into Rand!a2.0\n\nPlease vote.

      <li>Title::: 'Hi there, I have seen so many post bashing swara bhaskar,kunal, druv rathee etc. So I wanted to bring your attention to a very important point.'<br />Body: 'All these are well planned marketing and PR tactics. Did you know who tf swara bhaskar is before she started to tweet extreme left wing tweets? Nope. They thrive on attention, heck it\'s their source of income because they are public figures. And thanks to all those who take the bait, she is getting popular by every passing day. Which is a big win for her and the PR team behind it. So if you truly want to beat them, just stop giving them attention. Its as simple as that. Remember no publicity is bad publicity. Also, the more you quote thier name, they get more attention not just from the public but also from search engines and social media platforms. There is an algorithm that calculates the number of mentions and based on that, they consider that topic or person popular. Which means they get higher ranking on search engines as well as more appearance in people\'s news feed with the sentence "Popular in your area or something" I don\'t remember the exact sentence, but I think you got my point. \n\nComing to Facebook, because it\'s the biggest social media platform, it has become pay to play (a long ago) for business. Even if you have liked any page (meme, celebrity, whatever), it will not appear on your news feed unless you are engaging with that page very frequently or is very popular. So because many people take the bait and go to that page to "bash them" , it means (from the Facebook algorithm\' s perspective) that you are interested in that page and it starts to appear more frequently on your news feed. So by mentioning the name of persons you hate on any platform, even on Reddit, you actually help them.  I know many of you already know this but just wanted to inform those who don\'t all these.

      <li>Title::: 'My thoughts on The Tashkent Files....'<br />Body: 'Since there seems to be a unilateral boycott by "professional" reviewers on this topic, I thought i might share some of my views on this film.\n\nSince i am not adept with words like professional reviewers, let me get straight to the point.\n\n**The Premise**\n\nThe film sets out to investigate the events surrounding Lal Bahadur Shastriji\'s mysterious death, following the signing of Tashkent agreement. The film presents documentary evidences, real life testimonies and some events that were conveniently ignored following the death of Shastriji. The writers have tried to establish that the circumstances following Shastriji\'s death were circumspect and a large scale cover-up followed by the establishment to suppress the events surrounding the death. It also tries to weave a conspiracy theory as to who might have benefitted from the death.\n\n**The Style**\n\nMy first impressions, in the first 15 mins, were that the movie is not shot in typical bollywood style. The cinematography and the script seems to be more appropriate for a Web series than for a full 70 mm theater screen. Still by the time the story progresses, you seem to ignore these minor infractions.\n\nAlso the screenplay, is not that of a typical investigative thriller, but more like the ones set in 12 Angry Men. So you might want to experience this just for the sake of how the screenplay is set.\n\n**The BAD** \n\n* The lack of facts. The movie revolves around just 3-4 crucial facts to build up a case that there was foul play surrounding the events. But it does not invest enough screen time to justify as to how these facts are relevant to the case. Which is why i think the writers could have done justice to the subject in hand if they made this as a web-series rather than 2 hour movie. But those are just my opinions.\n\n* Towards the start of second half, the movie aimlessly veers in to the territory of Anti establishment, Anti Lutyens propoganda, Socalist-Capitalist dichotomy, Communal and anti-marxist hagiography. All of this could have been ignored and the writers could have stuck to justify the point above. However, the people around me nodded their heads when this point came about, making me think that this was by design. So yeah kudos to the writers. \n\n* Towards the end, the lead character is termed as anti national. The justification for which is flimsy at the best.\n\n* the writers assume LBS was a great PM, without sufficiently establishing why he was great. To me the writers could have spent some time building up his character rather than some fleeting references.\n\n**The GOOD**\n\n* Acting by the lead lady, Mithun and Naseerudin Shah is terrific. Mithun and Naseer play their roles as *proxy* Vajpayee and Chidambaram very convincingly.\n\n* the Writers have somehow managed to weave a propaganda and conspiracy theory brilliantly amidst facts. By the time you leave the theater, you are almost convinced with that there was some wrongdoing\n\n**The Best**\n\nTo me personally, the film highlights some aspects of our modern history that were carefully hidden behind propaganda. Things like how 42nd amendment mutilated the constitution, how India was up for sale in cold war. How we never had a semblance of independent foreign policy, despite being a part of Non aligned movement. \n\nI personally think people need to know about this stuff, and i applaud the makers for the courage to show these aspects.\n\nPS - Despite having had its shows reduced, the film was running full house in the theater i went to see. The crowd was mostly 30+ with mostly leaning towards the elderly. At the end, the movie got STANDING OVATION from some. Most of the crowd seemed convinced with the writers arguments. My wife, who is as apolitical as it gets, was as enthused as if one came after seeing a NOLAN movie. She even recommended this movie to her Congress leaning parents ..

Of course, the tragedy from Sri Lanka continues to develop, but the rest of the world has not been quiet either. To get the conversation started, here are some stories:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Imran Khan reshuffles cabinet amidst IMF negotiations](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/460137-whos-who-in-imran-khans-cabinet-after-reshuffle)\n\nPakistan PM Imran Khan reshuffled his cabinet, with some new and a lot of old faces (including many from Musharraf\'s techno-military government). But Asad Umar, the now ousted Finance Minister who was overseeing Pakistan\'s negotiations with the IMF for a bailout, has been replaced for no apparent reason. This puts into question those negotiations: Umar has been insisting that they will conclude a bailout this month, but other reports say that the IMF wants to look at the details of CPEC. Meanwhile, a Minister of State has been assigned to the States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON) Ministry, which was ironically [abolished](https://www.dawn.com/news/1477277) by Khan in Sept 2018!\n\n2. [Jokowi projected to win second term in Indonesia](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/indonesia-elections-what-a-jokowi-win-means-for-economic-reforms.html)\n\nIndonesian President  Joko Widodo (fondly called Jokowi) is all set to win a second term in South-East Asia\'s most populous country, according to unofficial estimates. However, while his party is also projected to win the largest share of seats in Parliament, it may fall short of a majority, even with its coalition partners, which will constrain the new President\'s ability to enact economic reforms. \n\n3. [Protests in Bangladesh over 18-year old girl\'s murder](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/woman-s-brutal-killing-bangladesh-triggers-protests-n996696)\n\nProtests broke out in Bangladesh after an 18-year old girl, Nusrat Jahan Rafi, was burned to death after claiming sexual harassment at the hands of the principal of the madarsa (Islamic school) that she studied in. The girl and her family have allegedly been receiving death threats to drop the charges, and even the police have been going soft on the case. However, her murder at the hands of five unidentified, burkha-clad people, has set off a storm, with Prime Minister Hasina herself promising to bring the perpetrators to justice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from world:\n\n1. [Sudan\'s dictator ousted from office](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47852496)\n\nProtesters, led by professionals such as doctors and lawyers, ousted Sudan\'s dictator of 30 years, Omar al-Bashir following a year of economic hardship magnified by the loss of the country\'s oil fields to South Sudan in 2011. Bashir was replaced by a "transitional" military council, but protesters have surrounded the Defence Ministry as well, determined to establish civilian rule in a country that has almost always been led by dictators. Meanwhile, the Bashir is expected to go on trial after huge amounts of money were found from his home. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for the genocide in Darfur as well.\n\n2. [Journalist\'s death angers Britain](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/4/19/headlines/journalist_lyra_mckee_shot_dead_amid_northern_ireland_riots)\n\nInvestigative journalist Lyra McKee, 29, was shot dead in Belfast amidst riots. Northern Ireland is a part of the UK and, like the rest of the Kingdom, is also set to leave the EU whenever that actually happens. However, the province is hotly divided on the question of seceding from the UK to join the rest of Ireland, a situation that routinely leads to violent protests and even rioting. With the danger of a hard border between the UK and Ireland growing ever more real, new militant groups are springing up, one of which was possibly behind this murder. The police are treating it as a terrorist incident.\n\n3. [Trump vetoes Yemen War resolution](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/politics/trump-vetoes-yemen-war-powers-resolution/index.html)\n\nUsing only his second veto of his presidency, US President Donald Trump vetoed a joint congressional resolution that would\'ve ended the US\'s role in providing support and weapons to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition that is at war with rebels in Yemen. There are no US armed personnel on the ground in the war, which is led by a former Pakistani army chief. The resolution saw several legislators from Trump\'s Republic party breaking with him to insist that the US should be out of the war that has led to mass starvation and disease, and which is seen to be strengthening Al Qaeda in the region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Operation Magic\n\nSince the invention of radio-wave transmission, governments all over the world have use wireless communication to pass on messages. The nature of this technology is such that anyone with a receiver and knowledge of the right frequency can listen in on what is being said - even your enemies. No wonder then, since time immemorial, people have sought to hide their messages, either by preventing enemies from getting a hold of it, or making it impossible to understand for anyone but the intended recipient. \n\nDuring WW2, the Imperial Japanese Navy, like all other participants in the war, used radio communication to send its plans to its ship commanders. These transmissions were encoded, with the Japenese using a modified Enigma machine (code-named Purple) obtained from their ally, Nazi Germany. At the time, the US was not a part of the war, but nonetheless listened in on Japan while also enforcing a blockade of Japan in aid of the British. But as the war in Europe and Asia progressed, the Americans started making an effort to break the Japanese codes - Operation Magic was born, to be led by the US Army\'s Signals Intelligence Section (SIS) and the Navy\'s  Communication Special Unit (CSU).\n\nThe task was painstaking, with intelligence becoming outdated by the time it was deciphered. Perhaps the most stunning example of this was the fact that the US was unable to intercept Japanese plans for a naval buildup west of Hawaii, and the eventual bombing of Pearl Harbour (this was made worse by the fact that late intelligence about Pearl Harbour was simply ignored!). But once the US joined the war in 1941, they received assistance from the infamous cryptographers from the UK\'s Bletchley Park (the most famous of whom was Alan Turing, although he did not go the US himself), who themselves had broken Germany\'s Enigma. \n\nBy the time the Pacific War had heated up, the US was fully able to decipher Japanese transmissions and, what\'s more, they were also able to decipher transmissions between Tokyo and Berlin, aiding the war in Europe too. All the Japanese operational plans were known to the Americans in plain sight, making Operation Magic a runaway success matched only by their counterparts in the UK. Since then, the US has worked stridently to maintain its leadership in what is now called Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). The US has what is believed to be the world\'s most powerful SIGINT agency - the National Security Agency (NSA), which was the natural offspring of Operation Magic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories caught your attention?

Non-state actors could target minorities just to shift blame on the parties, groups and even the religion of the majority. \n\nAnyway, my thoughts and prayers for the victims in Sri Lanka.

      <li>Title::: 'Blasphemy laws in India'<br />Body: 'National Laws on Blasphemy: India \nAs a home to numerous religious and ethnic groups, India has a number of laws against hate speech that fall under the “reasonable restrictions” to freedom of expression permitted in the Indian Constitution. Specifically, Sections 124A, 153A, 153B, 292, 293, and 295A of the Indian Penal Code prohibit any words or representations that insult any individual’s or group’s religious beliefs, or that are meant to incite enmity against a particular religion. The punishment for hate speech is a fine, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. Members of all of India’s faith groups can and do utilize anti-hate speech legislation when their religious sensibilities are hurt. Recent arrests include newspaper editors for articles criticizing the public nudity of certain Jain monks and arguing for the right to critique any religion, the latter of which angered Muslims; unprosecuted complaints have been filed by Buddhists against an actress who posed nude against a Buddha statue, and by Hindus against an athlete who ate beef during a cricket match. \n\nFrom &lt;https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/national-laws-on-blasphemy-india&gt; \n\nSection 124A in The Indian Penal Code\n101 [124A.

Playing into this threat, “blasphemy” laws exist and are being increasingly used and cited.\nSection 295 of the Indian Penal Code criminalises insult to religion; it allows up to three years imprisonment and fines for “whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of citizens of India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of a class.”\nIn addition, in 2011 the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued new rules requiring operators of social media networks to screen and remove blasphemous content within 36 hours of receiving a complaint.\nIn January\xa02015, the well-received and record-breaking high-grossing Bollywood film PK\xa0satirised problems with religion through the eyes of an alien in human form.\xa0It was\xa0criticised by Hindu nationalists who disliked its satire on “godmen” and called for\xa0a ban on the film and a the arrest of its star Aamir Khan and the filmmakers.\nDirector and writer\xa0Rajkumar Hirani responded\xa0by explaining,\xa0“In fact, with PK, I am saying that we are humans first and not Hindus or Muslims. Everyone should have the freedom to live and get settled with whoever they want to”.\nIn April 2012, the Catholic Church filed a complaint under Section 295 of the country’s penal code against Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association. Edamaruku had reportedly exposed a supposed “miracle” by revealing that a weeping Jesus on the cross was actually the result of a leaky drain. The local police requested Edamaruku turn himself in and face the charges. He now lives in exile in Finland.\nOn August 20, 2013, leading anti-superstition campaigner Narendra Dabholkar was shot and killed by two men on a motorbike. The murder came just days after the state government pledged to re-introduce an anti-superstition bill, aimed at making it an offence to exploit or defraud people with ‘magical’ rituals, charms and cures. This bill was closely associated with Dabholkar’s work, and was opposed by many rightwing and Hindu nationalist groups who labelled it “anti-Hindu”.\n\nFrom &lt;https://end-blasphemy-laws.org/countries/asia-central-southern-and-south-eastern/india/&gt; \n\nIn the more recent news people like Yogi Adityanath and Sadvi Pragya have critizied those who do not follow the principles of hindutva to the point of down right attacking them claming them to be anti religion and anti national. Which would mean that any one who critics the Polarizing hindutva ideology is a anti-national even tho in reality the principles of Hindutva in all aspects against the long standing tradition of Indian culture. It was rightly said by Dr. Shashi Tharoor in his book "why I am a Hindu" states that India is not in its ecence a secular [implying the separation of religion from public matters] but a pluralist nation in its functioning, that is to say that that the Indian society as a whole and the government has a active role in the religious functioning of the society, equally for each religious sect. in simple terms the government of India grands national holidays on all religious festivals for all the recognized religions, instead of giving no holidays for any religious festival. He in his book has very clearly defined the distinction between Hindutva and Hinduism, an who miss guided the right wing is unable to differentiate between the obsolete and legally problematic idea of Cultural nationalism, believing Indian culture is solely hindu, and ignoring the fact that the nationalism which is best suited for every one is territorial Nationalism, which allowed every India regardless of all secondary identifiers of his individual identity, to pledge his or her allegiance to the nation and the values enshrined in the constitution while being able to critic others for their fallacies and praise them for their good deeds with out this loyalty to a cause be questioned. But we follow the procedure of the right wingers Tharoor should be an anti national who doesn\'t understand the values of the country. \nThe actions and statement of the right wingers, who claim to up holed the ancient roots of India, violet the above mentioned sections in so many ways. This dose not apply just to the politician of stage but the large masses of people who support such people, and are the ground work of the polarizing  tactics which are aimed at the policy of divide and rule. It is not the center actively supports it, but it dose turn a blind eye to such problems in many cases. There are many postes and memes on the internet which violates the above mentioned Penal code sections, and yet they are ignored as they do not create drastic social upheavals. Yet these circulated in enough number to start a slow buildup in the momentum towards t a society moving towards polarizing ideas, and these masses change the out look of the society and ultimately end up in a group large enough to vote people like the Yogi and potential the Sadhvi into power. The consequences of this is already seen in the state of UP. I ma not saying that the Yadav government was any better in improving the life\'s of the people, but the BJP has changed the out look and from of the political momentum. Never has a  religious figure come to the power of a elected office in India, and it would be foolish to assume that the ideals of tolerance and equality would be met  as expected, which no hit to ward favoritism towards the religion of the elected official. \nThe vague definition of Defamation and insult has given rise to the more frequent invocation of the above mentioned section of the India Penal Code, when ever the majorities views are challenged, and when the same is done to the minorities their voices are suppressed as the people in power openly criticize the victims them self\'s, or just turn a blind eye. There are many places due to this, majorly in North India where a cow has more support and protection than a Human who followed a different faith from the mainstream majority. And in many cases where there have been a probe into  these matters there is little attention payed to why the people become so fanatic to kill some one over their beliefs, and rather focused on forensics to confirm where the meat was of that of a cow or not. Implying that if the meat was that of a cow, the lynch mob did the right thing? Ludicrous!!\n\nI Personaly think that blasphemy should not be a crime at all as it is a strong infringement of freedom of speech. I find it unfair that may religions can put up posters and legally have the right to promote their religion. But as and Athies if is were to put a banner starting \'god I\'d not real stop wasting time and money behind imagenay entities\' I am sure I would offend enough people to get me charged with a lot of things, and my banner will be brought down and most likely there would be a mob man hunting me, because they just love their scape goats.'<br />Author: 'KaranParindraDesai'  id: 'bffbij'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/bffbij/blasphemy_laws_in_india/</li>

Ms are not and their fertility rates are high and wherever they are approaching 25–40% population, it's a red flag.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also societal unrest is correlated to excess number of young males (18–24 yr) and max point will be reached in this period.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And finally, all of these are part of greater cycles that govern changes in nature of memeplexes, cultures and tribes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There's a 80–100 yr generational cycle. (1947,1857,1760s,1670s, 1560s- 1580s — probe these dates and you'll find major crises events leading to changes in structure of civic authority)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3 of these generational cycles form a 200–250 yr cycle of empire, where the defining memeplex of the known world undergoes change.

It\'s not very often that the Qatari state\'s moutpiece gets a chance to hit 2 birds with one stone: evil America and evil India. Good job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut does this story add up? For me, it\'s not very convincing. \n\n1.\n\nThe driver claims he crossed the border through mexico. "*Then my agent brought me to Mexico, saying there was another option. In Mexico, he told me that I had to cross the border*". \n\nI have travelled through Mexico. If you\'re an Indian citizen, you need a transit visa just to change flights at the airport. In order to leave the airport, you need a tourist visa and further clearance to travel around Mexico. Without those visas and the necessary clearance, you\'re put in quarantine, you will be subject to deportation.\n\nIf you don\'t believe me, call the Mexican embassy, they\'ll be happy to confirm this. \n\nSo sob-story-singh needed to have papers just to get out of the airport in Mexico city, let alone "reach the border". Did he have them? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso...not that it matters...but Mexico is a nice country. Why not drive trucks there? Lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. \n\n *"Maybe once every 4 or 5 years I will visit India."*  \n\nSince when does the Indian government allow asylees to re-enter the country? Not to my knowledge. There\'s asylees in Canada who haven\'t seen their loved ones in more than 20+ years. Indian government hasn\'t changed its stance, as far as i am aware. \n\nIf you somehow "won" your American citizenship after successfully proving your case for asylum, the Indian embassy won\'t clear your visa/OCI application. At least not without an explanation for why you were seeking asylum in the first place. Most of these asylees never come back to India. \n\nAgain, if you don\'t believe me, you can confirm with any Indian embassy overseas or the Ministry of external affairs in India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. \n\nFinally, the usual garbage:\n\n *Sikhs have faced a lot of violence in India from the government. Many  times I speak with truck drivers who tell me about their family\'s  situation back in Punjab. Their brother or father may have been killed  by police and so they came to America through asylum because they are  scared for their life. Because of what has happened, many Sikhs want to  leave India and find a community or place where they are safe.*  \n\nObviously this is complete nonsense, because Sikhs are among the most prosperous religious groups in India. This isn\'t me being defensive, by the way - it\'s understood by foreign governments as well, and probably why most of these asylum cases are never successful. What\'s the success rate for these asylum applications?\n\nAs far as i know, the only successful asylees of sikh origin will be the ones from Afghanistan. For obvious reasons.

      <li>Title::: 'How the Anglo-American empire continues colonialism in a post WW2 era - MUST READ'<br />Body: " \n\n&gt;Last  December, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo made a speech before the  German Marshall Fund in which he spoke of the “Liberal International  Order.” A couple of years earlier, the New York Council on Foreign  Relations published a [blog post](https://www.cfr.org/blog/world-order-what-exactly-are-rules)  in which they set out to define something called the “international  rules-based order.” Apparently, these various Orders are threatened by  the emergence of new powers that are, frankly, just a little too  Asiatic. And evidently that is why we still have NATO, which was formed  to protect us from an East Bloc which went out of business 30 years ago.  But where did these Orders come from?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Did  you ever wonder what happened to the British Empire? Did it just  quietly go out of business after World War II? No, actually. It was  privatized, in the final chapter of a process which began in 1600 with  the charter of the British East India Company. Today, it is comprised of  a hybrid mix of raw materials, finance and media cartels, plus an  assortment of NGOs, NATO, and the institutions of the Bretton Woods  system (the latter started with good intentions, which were quickly  subverted.) The rest of it was renamed the Commonwealth, and then, of  course, you have the United States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People who  grew up in North America have spent their lives bathed in soothing  propaganda about the British Empire; they will tend to regard it as  benevolent, civilized, and genteel, if a bit snooty. Sir Winston  Churchill is seen as a plucky, resourceful, grandfatherly type who  rallied the Anglo-Saxon morale during the darkest hours of the Second  World War, and deserves personal credit for the defeat of Hitler (the  Russians could not possibly have done that.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  reality is somewhat different. The British ruled the largest and most  successful empire in world history with an iron fist. They had evolved a  methodology for keeping it under control, and their methods often  rivaled those of Hitler’s Third Reich in the calculated application of  brutality and terror.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dr. Shashi Tharoor, an Indian parliamentarian and a former Under-Secretary General of the United Nations, [holds Sir Winston Churchill personally responsible](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/world-history/winston-churchill-adolf-hitler-no-better-shashi-tharoor-indian-politician-post-colonialist-author-a7641681.html)  for the deaths of 4.3 million of the 35 million Indians killed by the  British during their long rule in that nation. Churchill was quoted as  saying, “I hate the Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly  religion.” Churchill was favorably disposed toward fascism, but saw the  Third Reich as unwelcome competition.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Following  World War Two, Britannia was no longer able to rule the waves. They  still needed the military muscle to punish nations that opposed their  policies, and for that, they turned to the United States. But Franklin  Delano Roosevelt did not share Churchill’s yearning to restore the  Empire. He told an apoplectic Churchill to his face: “I can’t believe  that we can fight a war against fascist slavery, and at the same time  not work to free people all over the world from a backward colonial  policy.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fortunately  for Churchill, Roosevelt died in 1945, and his successor, Harry Truman,  was an altogether different kettle of fish. On March 5, 1946, Churchill  traveled with Truman to the small town of Fulton, Missouri, where he  delivered a famous speech that introduced the use of the term “Iron  Curtain” into the popular lexicon, and was instrumental in launching the  Cold War. The Soviet Union changed rather abruptly from being America’s  key ally in World War Two, to being the principal enemy in the new war.  Great Britain, on the other hand, was now joined at the hip to the US,  in what was called the “Special Relationship.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Spy agencies  such as the CIA and MI6 were intimately interconnected, as were foreign  policy think tanks like the Royal Institute for International Affairs  (Chatham House) and the New York Council on Foreign Relations. American  news media increasingly took their cues from their British counterparts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  IMF was formed at the 1945 Bretton Woods Conference which set up the  framework for the postwar monetary system. That conference was the scene  of a conflict between Franklin Roosevelt’s man, Harry Dexter White, and  the British Empire’s man, Lord John Maynard Keynes. The familiar bone  of contention was whether the Bretton Woods institutions would be set up  in such a way as to liberate the developing world from colonialism, or  perpetuate it. As discussed earlier, following the death of FDR, the  British won the argument, and the Bretton Woods institutions became the  new, technocratic, supranational expression of the Empire. Former  Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere would one day ask, “Who elected the  IMF to be the ministry of finance for every country in the world?”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The IMF’s  policy was that developing nations must maintain a “balance of payments  equilibrium,” which meant that they were not permitted to run deficits.  This had the effect of trapping the Third World into a loan-sharking  relationship with the international financial institutions; they were  prohibited from making the long-term investments in the construction of  infrastructure and a manufacturing base that would make them  economically viable, so they were constantly under pressure to sell off  their national patrimony in order to maintain interest payments. The  culmination of the IMF’s policies was “debt for equity swaps,” where the  nation’s creditors would, in effect, “foreclose” and seize raw  materials in lieu of interest payments. This is the real debt trap diplomacy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  IMF would arrange for debts to be refinanced, but with strings attached  (this was the notorious policy called “IMF Conditionalities”.) For  example, the IMF would demand austerity, the reduction of living  standards in order to divert funds to debt payment. This meant the  dismantling of the “social safety net,” an end to food subsidies,  looting of pension funds, and cancellation of infrastructure projects.  Economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote that the IMF’s “usual prescription is  ‘budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own  belts.’” The IMF demanded that state-owned enterprises be privatized,  and any import-export restrictions designed to protect nascent  industries must be eliminated. The IMF policies were simply a new  version of colonialism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The IMF was  part of a cabal of supranational institutions who worked with private  banks and, later on, hedge funds, to plunder first the fledgling nations  of Africa, South America and South Asia, then the former Communist Bloc  nations after Communism’s demise at the end of the 1980s. Next on the  “kill list” were the more vulnerable European nations such as Greece.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So-called  “developing nations” that attempt to defy the IMF and stubbornly try to  develop must be punished with “regime change.” Inevitably, they will be  found guilty of either human rights violations or corruption, and a  plague of NGOs will be unleashed upon them as a harbinger of military  aggression. Particular ferocity is directed toward former British  colonies that refuse to toe the line.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The British  and their American henchmen are ardent believers in the doctrine of  Geopolitics, which conceives of the world as a zero-sum game where one  nation cannot grow stronger without finding ways to make the others  weaker. This was holy writ to the emerging [neoconservative](https://medium.com/@marisol.nostromo/what-are-the-neocons-really-19247b03a436)  movement, the most fanatical gang of Anglophiles known to man.  Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, neocons argued that no  competing superpower or constellation of powers must be permitted to  emerge.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With  Margaret Thatcher flying across the Atlantic to “stiffen the resolve” of  George H.W. Bush for the first Iraq War, and later Tony Blair  performing the same service for Bush Jr. using his “dodgy dossier,” the  British focused on the Mideast and guided the Americans into an orgy of  “regime change” wars there. The targets were chosen not because of oil  wealth, as some naive populists are inclined to believe, but because the  Brits and their neocon acolytes hoped to ignite a chain reaction of  instability all along the borders of Russia, India and China. This was  the “Bernard Lewis plan,” named for a famed British spook/academic who  settled in at Princeton University back in 1974, and began whispering in  the ears of American policy-makers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But  that plan has failed, thus far. Russia, China and India have all  survived and are working together in various ways to create an alternate  system to the British-designed “Liberal World Order.” Their system,  centered around the Belt and Road Initiative, looks to a world of  nations interconnected by and collaborating on a grid of technologically  progressive rail, highway and telecommunications infrastructure,  bringing real development for the first time to the former colonial  nations. Meanwhile, the “Atlanticist” countries are poised on the brink  of bankruptcy due to their preference for a “casino economy.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  British House of Lords recently issued a dire forecast, saying that if  Trump is re-elected to a second term, that could spell doom for the  “special relationship”. There is a special section of the report devoted  to the threat posed by the Belt and Road Initiative. The BRI, which  offers many Third World countries the only opportunity they have ever  had to achieve economic self-sufficiency, represents everything that the  Empire has historically striven to thwart.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chinese  President Xi Jinping made offers on two different occasions for the  United States to join the Belt and Road. Both times, Present Barack  Obama turned him down. President Donald Trump is pursuing a vacillating  and confused foreign policy, but when he is not finding opportunities to  recklessly confront Russia and China, he is tweeting about his  fabulously good personal relationships with Putin and Xi. If he  ultimately decides that there is a better deal to be found by joining  the Belt and Road than by clinging to the millstone of the Empire, we  might see the sun actually set on it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://medium.com/@marisol.nostromo/what-became-of-the-british-empire-3d2b4c1ffd5a](https://medium.com/@marisol.nostromo/what-became-of-the-british-empire-3d2b4c1ffd5a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou really have to wonder which side India falls on.
