      <li>Title::: 'When this Hijab debacle started, I was in favour of allowing Hijab in classrooms..'<br />Body: "It's true that many Stone Age muslims won't allow muslim girls to go to a normal school without hijab. It should be allowed on humanitarian grounds.\n\nBut the audacity of the fucking people - they compare it with turbans. They slander hindus. They compare it with janeus. They write sensationalised headlines slandering hindu gods. The worldwide symbol of oppression of women is suddenly a beacon of liberal hope in India. This country is a fucking joke. \n\nTurbans are mandatory. Turbans are for upkeep of long hair. Wasn't hijab always a choice? Until now of course, now it is mandated and written in the Quran. \n\nIf hijabs are mandatory, then forget school, we should protest against them nationwide. The whole point is that they aren't. They are a part of religious identity. If hijabs are to be allowed in schools regardless of uniform mandates, then on what basis will these institutions ever ban religious fanaticism of other sects? What stops someone from wearing a snake around their neck in the name of religious identity to school?\n\nIf the government tells you how to dress nationwide and in public, it's one thing. But this is a fucking school! With a uniform! How are they not well within their rights to ban occult clothing? \n\nAnd the misinformation is ripe on top of it - the school didn't cough up some islamophobic agenda. The school was always strict on the uniform, but the group of girls started wearing it suddenly around December - which is when they were disallowed entry. \n\nIf the Stone Age religion is so important to you, then go to countless other institutions that allow it right? Go to a madrassa, an all girls' school. Our country is one of the only ones that provide provisions for this. But no, THIS school must allow entry.\n\nAnd on what basis? Hijabs are not mandatory, they only form a part of religious identity. If they are to be allowed everywhere, then on what basis can you ever ban saffron shawl wearing hindutvavadis that you so despise? \n\nAnd what the hell does Janeu have to do with this? It's tucked away on the inside and is not visible. But no, if you ban hijabs, ban this as well - janeus, the symbol of oppression. People say this unironically. \n\nI am just beyond sick of all of this. This entire thing has really opened my eyes about how secularism has any legs only on the shoulders of hindus in this country. I am not one to condone extremism anywhere, but I swear to god we need more and more people adopting a hindu identity to make sure the hypocritical advantage this Stone Age cult gets in the name of being a minority gets exposed. I am tired of being attacked for my religious identity. I have never been a devout hindu at all, but all of this has made me lean towards becoming a devout hindu in practice for the sake of my culture.

      <li>Title::: 'A response to those who support women wearing hijab to school.'<br />Body: '1. Schools are private or government institutions, they are not public places and thus we must adhere to their laws. \n\n2. Schools and some colleges provide and mandate a school uniform. Anything other than that exact attire is unacceptable. A turban doesn\'t stop u from wearing your uniform, so does a tikal, dhaga or necklace. A hijab or burkha, whichever, completely overwrites the uniform and is seen as a security threat at many places. It\'s of if a muslim woman wears her school uniform and wear the thing whose name I\'m sorry I don\'t know over her head that matches the colour of her school uniform, like Sikhs wear turbans to match the school uniform colour. You can see this example in many western and even Muslim counties. But this agenda of pushing an entire religious attire instead of the uniform in wrong. Why do you think Hindus don\'t go to school in gerua dhoti and kurta. \n\n3. Now my most important point. *Anything that is mandatory cannot be a choice*. Muslim woman cannot wake up one day and say she\'s not gonna wear a burkha/hijab whatever it\'s called idk. They don\'t have a say, they must. Their choice is a delusion. They cannot suddenly say they want to enter a mosque for prayer. It\'s not their\'s to decide.\n\nSai Deepak J said something along the lines, "it is a secular place by nature.

      <li>Title::: 'Arguments against UNSUSTAINABLE meat consumption'<br />Body: "tl;dr - unsustainable meat consumption leads to environmental degradation, emissions, deforestation, hunger, slavery, zoonotic diseases, epidemics/pandemics, anti microbial resistance, etc.\n\nLet me start by saying that whenever one tries to have a conversation around meat consumption in India, one has to acknowledge the history of casteism. There is no denying the casteist connotations over here, and the learning for me has been it is natural for a person like me (UC Hindu) preaching vegetarianism to not be taken seriously in our nation given the history around caste and justifiably so. Hence folks like me need to check our privilege before preaching to others. I, and people like me, need to make an extra effort to make sure we aren‚Äôt weaponizing caste and definitely cannot look down on others who did not have the same privilege as us.\n\nLet me provide what I consider to be logical arguments as to why vegetarianism (VT), not even veganism(VE), is better than non-vegetarianism(NV). Because if VT &gt; NV then definitely VE is the best. Please for the sake of logic excuse my caste privilege here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA. Legal\n\nVT isn‚Äôt legally superior to NV.\n\nLegality follows practicality, morality and ethics, not the other way around.\n\nIt is illegal to smoke a joint.\n\nIt is illegal for a 24 year old to have hard liquor in Maharashtra.\n\nBut it is legal to rape your wife!\n\nIn some parts of the world it is legal for the state to execute you for drawing the wrong person!\n\nSo legal superiority counts for shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB. Moral or Ethical\n\nFirstly, I agree being a Vegetarian doesn‚Äôt mean one is ethically superior to a non-vegetarian. But in most cases VT is superior to NV, given all else is equal.\n\nLet us say 2 people belong to the same caste, creed, economic class, having the same environmental impact, using the same amount of animal products, both raised the same way, with the same food habits, same health conditions, same ability to digest meat, and are same in every other imaginable way. One of them is a meat eater, and the other isn‚Äôt, then obviously in **my view** the Vegetarian is more ethical.\n\nI absolutely understand the aforementioned scenario is never possible, and never have I said that VT is the only way to be more ethical. You may pick your own thing.\n\nAll of us have our own definition of who is important, who is in our circle, who is work preserving, who is worth fighting for, who is worth dying for.\n\nFor me personally it follows this order\n\n1. Humans I love\n2. Humans I know\n3. Children, innocents, etc within humanity\n4. Animals I love and know, cute baby animals\n5. Most of humanity(non Assholes) with a preference to people who are similar to me\n6. Other animals\n7. Reprehensible human beings\n8. Literal vermins, mosquitos\n\nI‚Äôd rather eat someone who believes Hitler/Mao were good than a puppy, kitten, calf,etc.\n\nWhen it comes to social justice we expect all of us to be on board with the fact that all humans are the same. Black people aren‚Äôt naturally slaves or white folks aren‚Äôt naturally smart. And we expect all of us to be on board with this idea regardless of what one‚Äôs personal definition is of who is a human.\n\nNow why can‚Äôt we extend the same to the animal kingdom?\n\nA couple of centuries ago race based slavery was a given just like non vegetarianism is.\n\nGood people could‚Äôve been slave owners back in the day, just as much as good people can eat non veg today.\n\nBut that doesn‚Äôt mean the act of killing a living being for food is acceptable\n\nNow let me come to why I said in **most cases** VT is superior to NV, not **all**.\n\nLet us say person A consumes the meat of an already dead animal, or for that matter humanely hunts to feed their family.\n\nWhereas person B is a VT, but who mistreats farm animals works them to death in the fields.\n\nIn **my view** unequivocally the meat eater is more ethical.\n\nI have a Sikh friend who comes from a family of meat eaters (2\\~3 times a week). He visited a slaughterhouse in his early teen years, and completely stopped eating meat afterwards.\n\nThis dude is 100% morally superior(in this regard) to me, a born VT who hasn‚Äôt even successfully quit milk! He‚Äôll retain that superiority even if he indulges in one off ceremonial meat consumption, because he has made the change despite contradictory societal expectation.\n\nBut in both these cases, all else isn‚Äôt equal. Also, morality is, according to me, more a function of the intent than an act alone. While I did say in most cases VT is superior to NV, given all else is equal, preaching VT completely depends on the intent. Attempting to claim some superiority over something one had nothing to do with is morally reprehensible. Wanting humans to show more compassion towards other living beings is pretty moral.\n\nBottom line, ones morality can‚Äôt be gauged on the basis of ones dietary preferences, but certain dietary preferences definitely are more moral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nC. Environment\n\nlivestock ‚Äî including cows, pigs, sheep and other animals ‚Äî are responsible for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions [http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/)\n\n26 percent of the Planet‚Äôs ice-free land is used for livestock grazing and nearly a third of all croplands are used for livestock feed production\n\nMore than 40% of crop yields are diverted to livestock with an average feed conversion of less than 10%. Meaning grains which could feed 4 billion people is used to get animal products which can‚Äôt even feed 400 million. While nearly a billion people go hungry around the world.\n\nPlus run offs from slaughterhouses getting absorbed by the soil or seeping Into water sources leads to massive environmental degradation.\n\nSo in a nutshell vegetarianism will help curb emissions, deforestation, hunger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD. Medical\n\nThe close proximity in which animals are kept in factory farms, slaughter houses and wet markets can lead to diseases jumping over from one host to another, which can be a cause of a future pandemic of zoonotic origin.\n\nThen there is the issue of animals being pumped with antibiotics. Excessive use can lead to anti microbial resistance among humans, which may cost us a century of advancement in Medicine (at least back to the days before penicillin)\n\n‚ÄòNow here are responses to some standard comments:\n\n1. Even plants have feelings, what about the bacteria?\n\nI agree, if my definition of living beings which matter can include non-human mammals, birds, fishes, etc. why can't someone else's include plants, micro organisms, viruses, etc.\n\nI'd imagine there would be 2 types of people in this bracket:\n\ni. Those who truly care about every being\n\nii. Those who absolutely do not care for any beings outside of the human race\n\nSome tenets of Jainism might be useful for folks in the (i) category\n\nFor the ones belonging to category (ii), please focus on the practical arguments against animal consumption like climate change, world hunger, slavery in meat packing and fisheries industry, neo-colonialism by Chinese and the Europeans, Pandemics, anti-microbial resistance, etc.\n\nAlso, this argument reeks a little of Absolutism\n\nJust because there is no way I can feed myself without causing harm so let me cause as much harm as possible!\n\nWe need to maintain a balance with our ecosystem. The problem is not meat consumption but unsustainable meat consumption.\n\nPlus there is the trophic value (i.e. Only about 10% of the nutritional value passes up the food chain). So consuming plants directly makes much more sense than things which consume plants.\n\n2. Humans are Omnivores\n\nI agree, I too have elongated canines. I am not arguing for immediate cessation of meat consumption across the world. But to use evolution in this argument, and this argument alone doesn't seem justified. What humans eat has drastically changed more than once since before the dawn of agriculture. While there is agreement on Humans being omnivores, there still is a lot of debate on the percentage of meat vs berries, plants, fruits, etc. and none of the sources I have across even state that it was mostly meat. If anything it is the other way around with meat being secondary and plant based sources being primary.\n\nAnd never in the history of humanity are we consuming as much processed food as today, animal based or plant based.\n\nSo whatever humans ate in the past, we no longer eat. If our internal organs were incompatible with a plant based diet I'd take your point.\n\n3. Tandoori Chicken is tasty\n\nYes, I know. That is precisely why I am asking you to save some for the future generations.\n\nWaise, just wanted to add that what you are eating isn't even chicken, not the same one when the recipe was first used.\n\nChickens used to live 20 years and weigh less than a kg half a century back. Now they live just for a few weeks and weigh 5 times as much!\n\nAlso, rather than going cold turkey, one can merely reduce consumption, only consume meat from sustainable sources, switch to artificial meat once it becomes commercially viable, etc.\n\n4. You are a rightoid\n\nI addressed this in the 1st para itself. I understand how a UC Hindu preaching vegetarianism in India can be seen having obvious caste undertones. This person who was born a vegetarian is preaching to our lot on changing our habits, he doesn't have to give anything up!\n\nPlus its not like vegetarians cant do better. Veganism exists. There is no point in revering cows if you use leather!\n\nPlus industrial milching of cows is worse for the environment than sustainable consumption of some meats"<br />Author: 'creganODI'  id: 'so3joa'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/so3joa/arguments_against_unsustainable_meat_consumption/</li>

People of Goa must be listening to me today. The way Sardar Patel made a strategy for Hyderabad and Junagad, if the same spirit was followed for Goa as well, then it would not have stayed under foreign rule for 15 years after India got independence. The state got liberated after 15 years of the country\'s independence,\' Modi stated.\n\nCiting media reports of that period, he noted that Nehru did not take any action against the Portuguese occupation of Goa, as he thought that it would harm his international image.\n\n\'This was his, Pandit Nehru\'s biggest fear. He thought that invading the foreign government would lead to destruction of his peace-loving global image. Let Goa suffer but my image should not get dented, he thought,\' Modi stated in the Upper House.\n\nHe further said: \'When satyagrahis were being fired upon by a foreign power, my Indian brothers and sisters were facing bullets, at that time our prime minister said that I will not send the Army. He declined to help the satyagrahis. This is the torture meted out to Goa\'s people by the Congress party. This led to 15 years more of foreign rule in Goa. Many brave souls had to lose their lives because of this.\'\n\nModi also referred to Nehru\'s speech on August 15, 1955, where he said that no army help would be sent to help the protesting satyagrahis and the matter would be resolved peacefully.\n\n\'People of my country were left helpless, this is what they did with Goa. The people of Goa cannot forget this attitude of the Congress party,\' Modi added.\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/politics/nehru-did-not-send-armed-forces-to-liberate-goa-to-protect-his-peace-loving-global-image-pm-modi\n\n#Congress fired brother of Lata Mangeshkar from All India Radio because he recited a patriotic poem of Veer Savarkar\n\n\'Her family belongs to Goa. Let me tell how they (Congress) treated her family, the country should know that. Lata Mangeshkar\'s younger brother Pandit Hridaynath Mangeshkar was fired from All India Radio. His fault was that he recited a patriotic poem of Veer Savarkar. He was fired from All India Radio in eight days, this is your freedom of expression,\' he said, attacking the Congress party.\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/politics/nehru-did-not-send-armed-forces-to-liberate-goa-to-protect-his-peace-loving-global-image-pm-modi\n\n"The Congress in a way is in the grip of urban Naxals. That is why its thought has become destructive. This has become a matter of concern for the country," he said.\n\nThe urban Naxals have completely captured the mind and thoughts of Congress and that is why they are raising the issue of rewriting of history, the Prime Minister said.\n\n#The Prime Minister also shared instances of the treatment meted out to legendary singer Kishore Kumar and poet-lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for their views against the Congress-led governments. \n\nThe prime minister also highlighted Congress‚Äô behaviour towards freedom fighter Dharampal and former leader Sitaram Kesari who was sacked from the party. \n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi then continued, ‚ÄúHridaynath ji said in an interview, which is still available, that he had told Veer Savarkar that he wished to perform the latter‚Äôs song. Savarkar replied, ‚ÄòDo you want to go to jail by singing my song?\'‚Äù So he aired his song and within eight days, he was removed from AIR.‚Äù\n\nAttacking the Congress party, PM said, ‚ÄúThis was your freedom of expression. These are the kind of instances you have presented in front of the nation.‚Äù\n\nPM Modi said, ‚ÄùThat is not all, Majrooh Sultanpuri was jailed for one year for criticising Pandit Nehru‚Äôs behaviour. Dharampal too was imprisoned.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄùPopular music star Kishore Kumar too was sidelined for not agreeing to Indira Gandhi during the Emergency and not speaking in favour of the Emergency.‚Äù\n\nPM Modi further stated, ‚ÄùWe all know what happened when even one person raised their voice against the Special Family, we all know what happened to Sitaram Kesari.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.newsbred.com/latas-brother-was-removed-from-air-for-airing-savarkars-poem-modi-on-congress/\n\n#PM Modi in Parliament:If India is not a nation, why call yourself Indian National Congress?If, going by Gandhi‚Äôs wish,there had been no Congress,there would be no stain of Emergency.Sikhs would not have been massacred.Women would not have been burnt in tandoors.\n\n‚ÄúThe Congress‚Äôs problem is it has never thought beyond its dynasty. The biggest threats to democracy are dynastic parties. And when a family becomes paramount then the first casualty is talent,‚Äù PM Modi said in Rajya Sabha, replying to a debate on government policies. \n\n‚ÄúPeople wonder what if there had been no Congress. They are stuck in India is Indira, Indira is India,‚Äù the PM said, referring to a Congress phrase for one of its iconic leaders, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. \n\nHe said Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Congress to be scrapped. ‚ÄúThis was Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs wish ‚Äì he knew what would happen if they remained and said destroy this. If Gandhi‚Äôs wishes had been followed, India would have been free from nepotism,‚Äù he remarked. \n\n‚ÄúIf, going by Gandhi‚Äôs wish, there had been no Congress, democracy would have been free of nepotism. India would have taken the swadeshi path. There would be no stain of Emergency. Corruption would not have been institutionalised for decades. There would have been no casteism or regionalism. Sikhs would not have been massacred. There would not have been an exodus from Kashmir. Women would not have been burnt in tandoors. The common man would not have had to wait so long for basic facilities,‚Äù PM Modi said.  \n\n‚ÄúI can keep counting,‚Äù he added. \n\nCongress ‚Äúis trapped in the ideology of urban naxals‚Äù. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why their mentality is destructive.

      <li>Title::: 'Issues with my landlord ever since I decided to vacate my house'<br />Body: " \n\nI am facing issues with my landlord ever since I decided to vacate my house in Bangalore. Let me summaries all the points\n\n1)After  the 1st lock down is over(Aug 2020), We came to our hometown and didn't  return back untill June 2021. Stayed till Oct 2021 and again came to  hometown. Finally decided to vacate and informed in mid of Dec that I  will vacate in first week of Jan. Vacated on Jan 3rd but paid for entire  Jan rent and power bill (not complaining here). Some  of my colleagues got decreased rent during this time period. I didn't  ask for any deduction but only asked for not to increase the rent in  Apr(that's when my agreement expires)\n\n2)In  DEC Owner said that my meter is not working and I am only getting  minimum bill. Meter will get changed in end of Dec and I will get the  previous bill also in Jan bill. Jan bill is 5500. Till date my max bill  amount per month was 800/- and in the past 17-18 months I have stayed  only for 3 months. Clearly 5500 is huge and something is wrong. Wanted  to raise a complaint with bescom but owner doesn't want me to as I have  already vacated and he will need to run around bescom office\n\n3)Didn't  give all the keys but in the agreement he mentioned all the keys. I  blindly signed it(my mistake) and now he says he has given them and  wanted me to pay for them. Deducted 15k for a 1bhk painting charges.\n\n4)Bathroom  shower mixer joint came off long time back and I tied it with a rope  and forgot about it. We both realized it on the day of vacating. It is  only an issue of the joint and if a plumber puts the seal and screws it  the tap is as good as new (remember its not broken, only a seal issue).  Owner wanted to change entire thing which costs 6000+. He didn't want to  at-least share 50-50, Finally agreed that he pays 30%.\n\n5)After  deducting last two months rent from the advance, Painting charges, he  has 41k advance with him. Gave two cheques one for 20k with Jan date and  another 21k for March date. Jan power bill and Wall mixture, plumber  charges and duplicate keys amount which is 11k goes in the March dated  cheque.\n\n6)Now I have en cashed Jan  cheque. I have two options, transfer 10k to him via NEFT and I can  encash the march cheque. Or cancel the march cheque and he will trnasfer  me the amount through NEFT. I chose second option because if I transfer  the 10k to him, he can still keep the cheque on hold. So I don't want  to lose any money further. He asked to tear the cheque, video it and  then courier the teared pieces.\n\n7)Before  tearing the cheque, I asked him to confirm when and how much he will  transfer. He confirmed to transfer the 11k by 10/Feb. I couriered and it  got delivered. Now yesterday he sent two images in whatsapp, one the  washing machine tap is fitted with the steel  washing machine adapter  with some mseal and two the plastic cap on drainage outlet near washing  machine came off.\n\n8)When I joined  the house, the washing making inlet tap is of plastic kind and the  threads we have to the nozzle where we can fit the washing machine inlet  are worn off. So plumber had fit the adapter and applied mseal, else he  told we need to chnage the tap. Since it is a minor thing I went ahead  asked him to fit that and I am not damaging anything but enhancing. And  the plastic cap on drinage outlet is like that and its common in so many  houses to have not that fixed. Even in my house we have it like that  since it is easy to clean. Soon after joining the living room tubelight  is gone, I had to chnage it. Since the owner doesn't live in the same  building what ever small repairs I got it done by myself and most of the  times I informed him before doing it but I was not able to in case of  the tap.\n\n9)Now owner says he will  transfer the amount by month end which is not what we agreed to,  otherwise I would have sent the cancelled cheque then only.\n\n10)  Now I am ready to lose the remaining amount but I am fed up with his  antics. I want to take some action. What is the best I can do, any  ideas, I want to document all our conversation and put it in twitter  tagging Banglore police to start with\n\n11)Or am I being unreasonable and unfair."<br />Author: 'BudPad'  id: 'sni6ig'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sni6ig/issues_with_my_landlord_ever_since_i_decided_to/</li>

Narasimha Rao is a US-based Astrologer.  He has a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree from IIT, Madras and\xa0 a Masters from Rice University, Houston.  He went into Research of Astrology because he had doubts about the Science.  Today, he is an acknowledged Master in Astrology. Like late Bejan Daruwala, Narasimha Rao also has become famous for his predictions.*\n*He claims to combine his knowledge of Sanskrit with Scientific temper to conduct fresh Research into the teachings of the Rishis.  Among other prophecies, Rao accurately predicted the Covid Pandemic and Donald Trump‚Äôs defeat**.\n\n*Here is the gist of his Future predictions:*\n\n\n*1). YS Jagan, CM of Andhra Pradesh, is having good Political time running for the next term also. He can be defeated the next time only if the other side is authentic and committed. Otherwise, Jagan will win another term in Office.*\n\n*2.Yogi Adityanath will sail through 2022 Vidhan Sabha Elections with comfortable margin.*\n\n*3. BJP will win 2024 National Elections, but by early 2026 Modi will hand over the Prime Ministership to Yogi Adityanath &amp; retire.*\n\n*4. The year 2030-2031 is the year in which a major World War (aka) a Mahabharat, will take place. India will be steered brilliantly by Yogi Adityanath in those troubling times.*\n\n*5. Tibet will be freed in the next 10-15 years while China will be balkanized into many parts*.\n\n*6. US is destined to go down steadily, like UK did post WW-II.*\n\n*7). For Afghanistan, the light at the end of the tunnel is far away. I see no hope for any improvement till 2042.*\n\n*8). Very bad times are coming for Pakistan from mid-2022*. *Taliban-created insurgency will trigger problems for both Pakistan and China.*\n*China is likely to see much unrest in Xinjiang Province by Uighurs, supported by Taliban.*\n\n*9). Middle East will burn. There is going to be a turmoil ripping through Major Powers in the Middle East. Iran will be the epicentre of this turmoil*.\n\n*10. The years between 2019 to 2036 are the most turbulent for the World. Look at the 20th Century; things were very bad from 1920 to 1945, (i.e) 25 years. The Great Pandemic created havoc in 1920, the Great Depressions started in 1929s, followed by World War. Same pattern will unfold in the 21st Century, but for not that much long period.*\n*Great Depressions are indeed expected after 2026, followed by a brief World War between 2030-2032, and then things will start cooling off*.\n\n*11). The population of Apostates, Atheists etc. is going to explode in every religion. While this will be good for Hinduism, it is going to be very bad for Abrahiminic faiths (Cristian), and worst for Islam*.\n\n*12. Western Civilization is basically unsustainable. It is against nature. Older civilizations like Indian, Latin American, Aboriginals of New Zealand, Australia &amp; Africa were far more in sync and compatible with environment. Western civilization cannot be sustained by nature even for a few decades from now*\n\n*13. The coming apocalypse is nothing but a ‚ÄòCourse Correction‚Äô by Nature. After this turmoil is over, the World will move towards a sustainable way of living, a Dharmic way of life, (i.e) towards Sanatan Dharm*\nüëáEditor‚Äôs note:\xa0*We believe only in fact based rationalistic approach.* *Since the astrologer is popular, we are publishing his prophesies for information so that curious people may read and verify with the facts since some of the predictions are about elections which are not far away*.\n\nhttps://www.primepost.in/modi-to-handover-reins-to-yogi-in-middle-of-next-term/\nüáÆüá≥üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üáÆüá≥\n\n\nHalf of this is obvious based on current trends...'<br />Author: 'AUMOM108'  id: 'slyige'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/slyige/totally_authentic_predictions/</li>

A little bit of info about what bhakti really is and how it ties into the Sabrimala and Rama Janmabhoomi issues'<br />Body: 'I had a friend in college who was asked by his other friends why he did pooja in front of an idol. Why do you go to Tirupati? Isn\'t god omniscient? Poor guy didn\'t know the answers and the bullies knew this.  They would ask him why he lights a deepam, and agarbatti? He used to be  depressed by the constant heckling. And because he was a person who did  rituals.  \n\nI see this heckling everywhere today and people still call Hindus idol worshipers.   \n\nIt\'s not idol worship because it\'s not an idol. It\'s a person. That\'s what bhakti means. You have personified the paramatma. And that\'s not a  temple he/she lives in. It\'s their home, it\'s a place of residence.  \n\nMost big temples will bathe their deity twice in a day. The people who  do this are caretakers of the person living inside. They change their vastras(garments), and they feed the deity thrice a day. Whatever is  leftover is shared by the visitors to this "temple". That\'s called prasadam.  \n\nOn their birthdays, the caretakers pamper the deity, he\'s given his favourite food, he\'s bathed in milk and given new clothes to wear, just like we would celebrate any birthday.  At the end of the day, curtains are drawn and the deity is assumed to  retire for the day. The deity is not disturbed until sunup. These rules are followed not because there\'s an idol there. There\'s a person living inside. \n\nEver been to Tirupati? When people  finally get a glimpse of Govinda, they shout happily his name, they are  greeting and saying hello. It\'s a person not an idol.  That\'s the beauty of bhakti. You can have any relationship with your  Ishtadevta. They can be your mentor, your father, your mother, your  husband, lover, a friend or even a son. You can assume that your "god"  is your son. Let that sink in. In some circles this is blasphemy. But not in Hinduism.  \n\n Even Shankaracharya, who revived advaita, finally composed Bhaja  Govindam. Because he knew that there are idiots who will resort to  name-calling.  Not everyone can read and decipher the Vedas. Not everyone can sit and  do multiple kriyas for hours. Not everyone has the discipline to commit  to pranayama.   \n\nThis is the reason bhakti is so popular. \n\nNow that we have established what Bhakti is, this philosophy is the reason Sri Rama owns the Ayodhya land. It\'s literally his. That is why the lawyer argued the case for "Rama lalla". The temple is a place of residence for Rama. It\'s not even a temple in the actual sense. We didn\'t fight for a place of worship. We fought for Rama\'s right to live where he deserved to live - his home. The privilege of us going there to worship him is all a byproduct and not really that critical.\n\nBhakti is the reason Sabrimala has no entry  for women. There\'s a brahmachari living in there. A brahmachari in real ashrams do not even look at women, forget interacting with them. Not because women are impure but because it is a discipline to always think of the brahman, nothing else. Biological desires are extremely strong and our history is littered with stories of rishis failing at their penance because of apsaras. Keeping this tapasya in mind, why would you send  women in? \n\nThe real problem here is that people have completely forgotten about how bhakti really works. That is why we have to resort to legal means to solve such situations. If people were really aware of what the situation entails, no woman would really enter the residence of a man who is a brahmachari. As simple as that. It\'s just common decency. If Hindus really knew what bhakti meant, no rule would be required.\n\nSpread spiritual awareness about these issues. Because the legal ones cannot encompass or resolve the system of Bhakti. Lawyers will argue for years and years and the judges will delay it until they can shirk off the responsibility to another judge. \n\nTeach people bhakti so that this widespread ignorance of these topics will fade away like mist as the sun comes up.\n\nThat\'s all. \n\nHaribol.'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'sl6on7'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sl6on7/hindus_are_not_idol_worshipers_a_little_bit_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[REPOST] How to keep a secret for 3000 years? Padmanabhaswamy temple kept $3 trillion worth of treasures safe from Islamists, British and, Communists by executing the greatest Indic heist in history of mankind.'<br />Body: '*Originally published on Indiaspeaks on 14th June. I have edited the text at some places to improve readability.*\n\n# A communist attempt by Pinaryi Vijayan government to loot Padmanabhaswamy temple to fill their party coffers - \n\nIn 2009, a rat by the name of T P Sunderrajan filed a PIL in the  district court of Tiruvananthapuram, challenging the authority of the  Travancore royal family heir over the Padmanabhaswamy temple and its  property.    \n\nSunderrajan was a man propped by the CPI-M to ascertain as to how much  wealth the temple owned. Back then, very few people knew the extent of  opulence of the temple. But some rumour must have escaped because it got  the hinduphobic CPI-M very interested in temple finances of  Padmanabhaswamy.   \n\nIn January 2011, the Kerala High Court passed an order that the temple  and its management be given to the state government run by communists.    \n\nCome May 2011, Marthanda Varma, the royal heir, challenged the verdict  in the supreme court which stayed the order. But the court also ordered the inventory of all the temple assets, especially the one in the  underground vaults.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Thus came out the extent of wealth the temple held in its vaults - \n\nThousands upon thousands of gold coins, jewels and precious stones the  size of people\'s thumbs. A life size moorti of Vishnu cast out of pure gold and embedded with diamonds and rubies and emeralds.   \n\nThere are french colonial era gold coins with Napoleon Bonaparte\'s face on them. There also hundreds of pots of gold coins from the Roman and Greek empires dating back from before the birth of Christ.   \n\nThe conservative estimate of this treasure is around $2-3 trillion,  without even taking into account the unopened vaults and approximately 3 TONNES of gold dust lying around the vaults.   \n\nHow did Sunderrajan know such a treasure is buried under the temple?   ***He\'s a former Assistant Director of Intelligence Bureau and a close  confidant of Indira Gandhi and a lifelong Congress loyalist.*** \n\nIt was in 2020 that finally the Supreme Court passed the order that the temple management belonged to the Travancore royal family and not the state government putting an end to Vijayan\'s dream of looting Bhagwan Vishnu\'s assets.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How Hindu kings sent their wealth to Bhagwan Padmanabhaswamy for safekeeping - \n\nThere are many speculations as to why the temple is so rich. One of the  expert opinions is that all the Hindu wealth from across Bharat was  relocated to Tiruvanathapuram for safekeeping. This included northern kingdoms too~~, since the southern kingdoms as south as Kerala did not interact with the Greeks.~~  \n\nIt is the accumulated wealth of the **Chelas**, **Pandyas**, the **Ay Kingdom** and finally the **Travancore Kingdom**. But we can assume that wealth from  erstwhile Northern kingdoms also found way here in the form of dana by visiting Hindu kings on a pilgrimage to pay obeisance to Padmanabhaswamy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The clandestine way the royal families kept the treasure a secret by way of renovations -  \n\nHow does one construct a complete maze of vaults underground without  people ever knowing?   The answer lies in deliberate sabotage and renovations.    \n\nThe earliest record of renovations is recorded in 1050 AD when a Venad king ordered renovation by removing the moorti of Padmanabhaswamy.   \n\nAnother extensive renovation was performed in 1461 AD and the moorti was  reinstalled.   \n\nThese "renovations" are nothing but careful and planned construction of  the underground vaults and their expansion.    \n\nIn 1689, the temple was almost destroyed in a fire. Only the moorti of  Vishnu survived.  In 1729, Thirunal Marthanda Varma, finally began rebuilding in earnest.  The construction ended in 1733.   \n\nI am speculating that it is here that all the vaults are constructed and  deemed completed. Because right after this Thirunal Marthanda Varma  announced himself as the servant of Vishnu or Padmanabha dasa,  dedicating all his wealth to Vishnu.   \n\nIn hindsight Marthanda is a visionary because the Dutch invasions and  Islamic trouble started in 1735, a mere two years after the temple was  completed.   \n\nBut the fundamental question is that how did the temple keep the  knowledge of such a treasure secret from the British and Islamist conquerors, especially the Mysore Sultanate?    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The genius strategy to fool the British in 1848 - \n\nTraditionally Travancore kings participated in the ceremony of mahadanams (great charity).    \n\nIn this ceremony the king\'s would give gold and wealth to the brahmins on their kingdom. **Each brahmin would get at least 80 grams of gold as  charity.** They did this every year, and gave away gold to thousands of  brahmins.    \n\n***But in the account books they shared with the British, they showed depleting finances.***  \n\nThis "grave financial condition" concerned the Governor general of India  and he warned the king Uttaran Tirunal in 1848 that if he continued  doing this charity, his kingdom would be acceded to Madras presidency.   \n\nThe king happily stopped the mahadanam ceremony to the happiness of the  British who were finally satisfied that the kingdom would not bankrupt  itself.  \n\n***Thus by smart accounting and charity, the king easily made idiots of the British and kept them in the dark about the treasure.***   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Trouncing Tipu Sultan in battlefield and keeping the East India  Company away with diplomacy in 1789 -  \n\nThe first real threat by way of force after Travancore was formed came  in the form of Tipu Sultan.   Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma was the son of Marthanda Varma, the king  who established the Travancore royal family and declared the family as Padmanabhaswamy dasas(servants of Vishnu).   \n\nHe made sure to keep the British calm by diplomacy, recognising that he  could not have a war on two fronts with such a treasure under his  safekeep. When Tipu Sultan attacked with his son, Karthika Varma defeated him, and routed his Islamic ego.   \n\nThe defeat was a significant one because there were thousands of Hindu refugees who had migrated to Tiruvanathapuram to escape the Islamic atrocities by Tipu Sultan.   \n\nTipu had demanded that the refugees be returned to him, but **Varma refused and went to war for the Hindu refugees and won this ending any  possibility of Islamic attack and upholding Hindu dharma.**   \n\nThus by keeping people in the dark, the Travancore royal family and their descendants have kept the treasure away from malicious agents and agencies.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this will not end here. The Communists and the Imperialist Congress  forces want the temple treasure to be taken out and kept in a museum.  Many voices also want to use the treasure to erase the debt by allowing  government control over it. We know how much of it will be left when the  Commies will go through it, looting god knows how much.   \n\nThe royal family is right - the treasure belongs to Bhagwan Padmanabhaswamy and Him only. They are just the caretakers. And what  marvelous caretakers to protect Bhagwan\'s treasure for over 3 millennia!  No such feat of secrecy has been accomplished ever in the history of  mankind. \n\nTo know what would have happened to the treasure just look at  the Mayan, Aztec and Egyptian treasures. But the wolves are circling even now. \n\nThis temple is a classic case why  we need to make provisions to free temples from ever coming under  government control.   \n\nWe need to make sure that it remains Bhagwan\'s forever.  \n\n***Aum Padmanabhaya Namah!***    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. -  A little about the Travancore royal family tradition of Muramakkathayam  or the matrilineal succession -  \n\nIn the Travancore royal family, the women has more power than the men.  The king was not the son of the previous king. To be the king he had to  be born to the sister of the king. Thus the nephew would inherit the  title of king.  If the king would beget only sons, a girl child would be adopted and  then a son, who is not of king\'s blood would become the successor. Show this to the people who attack Hinduism for being patriarchal. The  richest religious institution in the WHOLE WORLD was and still is  managed by the authority of women. And this is not the sole example either. There were many such kingdoms across India that practised matrilineal succession - most notably the Garo and Khasi and some families in Karnataka.\n\nThat\'s  it.    \n\nNamaste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources -  \n\nA complete legal explanation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple case by J Sai  Deepak -  [https://youtu.be/g2B30mZmgwM](https://youtu.be/g2B30mZmgwM)\n\n\n\nOwnership of the temple -  \n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/20110718-who-owns-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-in-kerala-746812-2011-07-09](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/20110718-who-owns-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-in-kerala-746812-2011-07-09)\n\n   \n\nHow Travancore rulers fooled the British by the display of mahadanams  under the section "cessation of mahadanams" - \n\n [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travancore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travancore)\n\n   \n\n RBI wants to take the treasure -  \n\n[https://m.rediff.com/news/interview/temple-may-have-to-pledge-treasure-to-rbi/20200725.htm](https://m.rediff.com/news/interview/temple-may-have-to-pledge-treasure-to-rbi/20200725.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShashi Tharoor speaks for temple independence from government saying the  treasure belongs to Vishnu.

This was in the economic survey section.\n\nFound this article:\n\n[https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Bulletin/PDFs/74250.pdf](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Bulletin/PDFs/74250.pdf)\n\nBasically, it comprises of trade in services, namely, travel, software services and business and professional services.\n\nDespite the pandemic, the invisibles were higher in the first half of 2021-22 surpassing pre COVID-19 levels.\n\n**Capital Account vs Current Account**\n\nLet‚Äôs understand what is capital account.\n\nCapital Account is to track the net balance of international partners whereas current account is to track actual transactions.\n\nThe current account is important as it shows the country‚Äôs net income over a period of time. However this has become deficit for some time.\n\nTherefore the PLI schemes for 14 sectors which have been approved are a good relief as it can boost the current account and bring India back to surplus.\n\nCurious enough I decided to look at the data for the past few years and this has been shocking.\n\n[https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS?locations=IN](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS?locations=IN)\n\nThe current account has been deficit during UPA rule.\n\nThe current account comprises of :\n\nMerchandise Trade (goods and commodities that are bought from or sold to other countries)\n\nServices\n\nIncome Receipts\n\nUnilateral Transfers.\n\n**Why Current Account has not improved?**\n\nMany have emphasized on India setting up semiconductor industry which is true.\n\nIf we look at Table 2 in page 96, you would notice that India had to import $15.3 billion of electronic components, $10.4 billion of computer hardware and peripherals. We can translate this import amount into export. \n\nIf you look at Airbus manufacturing, all of its parts are imported but are assembled at Germany mainly. This is called strategy.\n\nIt is good to know that Tata intends to set up semi conductor factory. Tata has TCS which exports software services and provides IT consultancy. So does Mahindra.\n\nI feel that we need to support Modi Government‚Äôs vision of Aatmannirbhar Bharat and Make in India initiative. \n\n**Challenges**\n\nMany of the state governments are not on the same page of the central government.\n\n1) Land Acquisition\n\nWe need to provide land for businesses to quickly set up manufacturing plants to kickstart the process\n\n2) Red Tape\n\nMy family friend told me that red tapes have significantly reduced. It is good to see Piyush Goyal Ministry doing the following:\n\n**Solution**\n\nSetting up the National Single Open Portal helps to accelerate the process of starting up the business. ([https://www.nsws.gov.in/](https://www.nsws.gov.in/))\n\nHowever, there are 14 states participating. We need to encourage more states to be onboard.\n\nSecondly, we need to sign more FTAs with countries. The first one that was signed was in 2005 mooted by Shri Atalji and that country is none other than Singapore. You can refer to Singapore-India CECA. \n\nSingapore is also the highest FDI contributor to India. Therefore, there is an advantage to sign FTAs with other countries.\n\nIf India signs FTA successfully with EU, this is the biggest step they will take so far. We will be able to have our current account back to surplus and have more investments.\n\n[https://goachronicle.com/india-has-launched-fta-talks-with-uae-australia-eu-canada-gcc-keen-says-piyush-goyal/](https://goachronicle.com/india-has-launched-fta-talks-with-uae-australia-eu-canada-gcc-keen-says-piyush-goyal/)'<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'skz7ej'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/skz7ej/simple_analysis_of_economy_survey_part_2/</li>

Only when we have strong local level government from Panchayats to wards, then only we can think of development . For decriminalising we have to demand for accountability in electoral funding as well as participation of general public in electoral funding.

The National Investigation Agency had recently booked three people in a fake passport case under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Former operatives based out of Denmark and Switzerland were trying to withdraw money to fund the activities of the now defunct outfit. Sources tell OneIndia that in the past couple of years, these former operatives had funded webinars to speak about the importance of the revival of the LTTE. The targeted public are in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu and these NGOs arranging these webinars had tried to convince the people that the rise of the LTTE is directly linked to Tamil nationalism.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;During the probe the agencies learnt that the money lying in the accounts linked to the LTTE went into several crores of Rupees. It remain untouched for long, but now attempts are being made to withdraw the same and use it for the revival of the outfit.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; **The case came to light following the arrest of a Sri Lankan national, Letchumanan Mary Franciska (50) from the Chennai Airport. The police said that the arrest was made as she was holding a fake Indian passport.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The lady had entered India in December 2019 on a tourist visa which was valid for one year. Citing the outbreak of COVID-19 she stayed back in India. She then took a house on rent at the Shakthi Colony in Anna Nagar. She got a rental agreement made and hid her nationality, which she went to use to get an LPG connection in her name.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Using the LPG connection, she got herself an Indian passport and a voter ID as well. She was arrested based on a tip-off when she was trying to fly into Bengaluru. **The case was transferred to the NIA when the probe against her revealed that she was in touch with the then active cadres of the LTTE.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The case was handed over to the NIA taking into consideration the larger conspiracy and the international ramifications as well. **Along with her four other persons, Kenniston Fernando, K Baskaran, Johnson Samuel and L Sellamuthu came under the scanner of the NIA.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The development came in the wake of another arrest that took place last October. On Sabsena, a former Intelligence officer of the LTTE was arrested inn connection with an arms smuggling racket**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Officials tell OneIndia that these persons were playing an active role in trying to revive the activities of the LTTE. The NIA in its FIR said that the accused persons had withdrawn money from the Indian Overseas Bank\'s Mumbai Fort branch. The money was being withdrawn to revive and further the activities of the LTTE.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; **An Intelligence Bureau official said that since the fall of the LTTE in Sri Lanka, the outfit had gone quiet. However over the past two to three years there have been signals of them trying to make a revival. They are trying to make out their case in Tamil Nadu and spread their message especially under the youth. The LTTE feels that they will be able to get the desired traction in Tamil Nadu which they may use to relaunch their outfit in Sri Lanka.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Earlier this month, the CB-CID, Tamil Nadu recovered a country made pistol used by a Sri Lankan don, Angoda Lock from Madurai. Lokka died of a cardiac arrest in July 2020. The CB-CID said that the pistol with five rounds was buried by a Madurai lawyer, whose father was an LTTE sympathiser. The agency said that there was a nexus between Lokka and Sabesan who was arrested for his involvement in smuggling drugs and arms from Pakistan.  \n\n\nRead more at: [https://www.oneindia.com/india/ngos-trying-to-revive-ltte-linking-it-to-tamil-nationalism-3366286.html](https://www.oneindia.com/india/ngos-trying-to-revive-ltte-linking-it-to-tamil-nationalism-3366286.html)\n\n[https://www.pgurus.com/nia-q-branch-of-tn-police-on-high-alert-as-probe-reveals-regrouping-of-ltte/](https://www.pgurus.com/nia-q-branch-of-tn-police-on-high-alert-as-probe-reveals-regrouping-of-ltte/)'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'sjkl2l'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sjkl2l/rahul_gandhi_yesterdayindia_is_described_in_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'On the naming of places and things after Europeans'<br />Body: 'A couple of days ago a newly discovered frog in Panama has been named after the "climate activist" Greta Thunberg. This has been [widely applauded](https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/scientists-name-new-species-of-rainfrog-after-greta-thunberg-7722489/) by liberals, environmentalists[ both in India](https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/new-species-of-rainfrog-discovered-in-panama-named-after-greta-thunberg-4661387.html) and around the world. \n\nThis got me thinking of how the European colonial practice of naming places and things still continues today. \n\nDo you recall the attempts to rename Indian places to their original names and how that was resisted by our "left" and liberals as "saffronization"? \n\nIn many ways we Indians remain perhaps one of the most colonized of people today as movements to address these lingering effects of colonization are addressed around the world. \n\nMost the attempts to address these issues is paradoxically coming from the west, mostly US for native American names of places and to some degree from Africa and Australia. Indian elites nostalgically rue that they have to say Mumbai instead of Bombay or Chennai instead of Madras.\n\nThere seems little understanding in our country, which suffered colonization and destruction of indigenous places and names from not only Europeans but also Turko-mongols and assorted invaders.  \n\nThe process of naming and labelling has been an important feature of the exploration and exploitation of land and territories by man. It became central to the appropriation of place and the imposition of European and imperial culture during colonisation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nFor example the labelling of Australia as *Terra Nullius* (uninhabited land) by the British authorities suggested that the land belonged to no one and that Britain was entitled to it all, especially as it was not exploited by Indigenous people in a European way since the latter did not use the land for agricultural and industrial development. The legal doctrine of Terra Nullius consequently justified Britain‚Äôs appropriation of place and Eurocentric approach of naming and renaming at a time when the Western world endeavoured to conquer what was thought to be untamed and uninhabited territories, for the grandeur of empires and to ‚Äúcivilize the savage.‚Äù Thus, after the arrival of the first British fleet on Australian shores, the newly discovered continent took various names and labels: ‚ÄúTerra Australis,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew Holland,‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat South Land,‚Äù ‚Äúthe colony‚Äù and ‚Äúpenal settlement,‚Äù for political and geographical designs. Paul Carter in his celebrated work The Road to Botany Bay insists that names invent the spatial and conceptual co-ordinates within which history occurs, that they bring history into being and embody the existential necessity a traveller feels to invent a place they can inhabit.\n\nIndigenous people in Canada are working to restore their place names and revitalize their languages after colonial policies and law sought to eradicate them. During the last several centuries, huge swaths of Indigenous lands were remapped and renamed by colonial powers, usually by white men. More often than not, places were named according to the whims of surveyors, cartographers, and politicians of the day. This is in stark contrast to the deeply meaningful, personal, and often spiritual naming practices of Indigenous peoples.\nWith the erasure and replacement of much of the vast catalogue of Indigenous toponyms, only a small fraction of Indigenous place names are today found on ‚Äúofficial‚Äù maps and signs.\n\nOf course, renaming has been a critical part of settler colonialism generally, which is  predicated on the erasure of Indigenous peoples, including their languages, cultures and social structures ‚Äî any and all evidence of Indigenous peoples‚Äô living presence. Thus, reverting to Indigenous place names in relation to oral histories, Indigenous laws, and languages is part of the process of reclaiming Indigenous knowledge and territories. In this piece we offer several examples of Indigenous nations who are actively reclaiming jurisdiction to their lands, and provide recommendations for how federal and provincial/territorial governments can help to undo some of these past harms and injustices.\n\nSome links for further reading: \n\nhttps://www.publicsource.org/why-indigenous-place-names-matter/\n\nhttps://www.10000birds.com/rename-all-birds-named-after-white-people.htm\n\nhttps://yellowheadinstitute.org/2019/10/08/reclaiming-indigenous-place-names/'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'sjhty2'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sjhty2/on_the_naming_of_places_and_things_after_europeans/</li>

( Ex : USA based companies- 20% , Germany based companies- 15% , British based companies- 30% Indian companies -10% etc ). Use this metrics to decide on the rankings of the institutions.\n\n2: Make the actual cost of training the student known to them and ask them to pay it back with interest to the institute, to be used for research purposes. This cost should include the running cost, historical costs used to set the institute up, and the brand value cost of the institute.\n\n3: Make the foreign companies that come for placements to the college, pay a percentage of the offer to them as a cost of hiring the best. Limit the percentage of foreign offers to a set percentage ( example: pay 50% of CTC to institute, can hire max 40% students for foreign companies)'<br />Author: 'SidMyn03'  id: 'sjbo8w'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sjbo8w/are_govt_owned_education_institutions_only/</li>

And if your punch was lethal, you get jailed. \n\nAlso, your reaction will only be considered self defence if you don\'t have the time to call the popo boys. So you can never attack first, you just have to wait for someone to stab you before you stab the attacker back. \n\nThe entire self defence laws/rights are based on probability as in you maybe given an exception if the judges feels cute.\n\nFyi, you will be charged with murder and arrested regardless because popo Boise filed fir and you would have to apply for bail if you want to come out of jail.

Please read in case you are even *considering* investing.'<br />Body: 'First off, [anyone interested in this NEEDS to watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g). Warning - it\'s LONG. 2hr18mins long. **But that\'s good** because it\'s a comprehensive video that you can watch to understand EVERYTHING you need to know about Cryptos, NFTs, DAOs, etc., that the promoters of these systems will *NOT* tell you about.\n\nI\'ve been following crypto and NFTs pretty much since their inception. For a while I too was enamoured (although cautiously skeptical), and at one point I was seriously looking at investing in a mining rig. And yes, mining can certainly be profitable if you\'re willing to make the initial investment (quite a steep one). But there are a lot of issues with the *other* aspects of crypto and NFTs.\n\nHere\'s my tip - \n\nSTEP BACK FROM THE HYPE. Avoid getting sucked into "in-groups" that will try to shut down critical thought and questions. I\'ve been a silent (skeptical) member/observer of several crypto subs and the amount of fake-hype is unreal. You have to realize that these people have a massive financial stake in this now, and in order for them to cash out, they need *others* to cash-in and buy what they have.\n\nIf you \'invested\' in beanie babies, or a thousand "energy crystals", you too would go around trying to convince the general public that these things are a *fantastic* business investment, and that you\'re making BANK by trading in them. The reality is, it\'s a gamble, and like all gambling, the house always wins.\n\nI was about to post this a few days ago, but after the "30% tax on crypto" in today\'s budget, and how some people are crying about it, this has become more relevant than ever.\n\nDON\'T FOLLOW THE HYPE.\n\n#WATCH THE VIDEO \n\nI can assure you it\'s fast paced and entertaining enough for even low-attention span folks.

However, the Economic Survey 2022 has a Table which shows why FM had to push a budget centering around infrastructure, education, industry, innovation.\n\n[Economic Survey 2022 Pg 201 \\(227 of 442\\)](https://preview.redd.it/flextelzo7f81.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8860b2e85cf8ed9c79c56ed07abe3b258f9cd69a)\n\n# Sustainable Development Goal 9\n\n[https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9)\n\nYou may refer to the link above. \n\nMany states have failed and India has just passed the SDG goals. The budget was made to accommodate such expenditures so that there is a push for infrastructure and states should work hand in hand with the Center to push India to greater heights.\n\nOf course, lot of issues arise from land acquisitions to political issues. It\'s welcoming to see the government invest in infrastructure. \n\nIndia needs to uplift more people from pandemic effect. Hopefully, the infrastructures will be ready by 2023 so that the next budget can lower the income tax slab.\n\n# Sustainable Development Goal 13\n\n[https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)\n\nThe Budget centered around climate action actually. \n\nIT is welcoming to see Government talking about this. Green bonds are indeed a welcome and shows India\'s seriousness to Climate Action. \n\nOne of the impact from this will be human health.\n\nThe mental health programme could be parked under SDG 3 and this one. But this is a good move to encourage clean energy and incorporate good planning with climate action thinking strategy. One way is to use ropeways in hill stations. Another is to incorporate public transport network when planning new cities.\n\n# Sustainable Development Goal 4\n\n[https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4)\n\nFM Nirmala stated that our school children have lost 2 years of schooling. (Page 12 of budget speech)\n\nShe mentioned many incentives. One such initiative is Digital Ecosystem for Skilling and Livelihood to promote online learning. This is to ensure the skills of the workforce gets constantly upgraded. One such country, Singapore uses SkillsFuture. ([https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/index.html](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/index.html)) If people continously upgrade their skills, then I am sure that more companies will be able to hire them. Moreover with new trends it\'s good to upskill regularly.\n\nAnother emphasis is on digital education. PM Modi had launched Digital India which is coming to fruition. \n\nHopefully the SDG ranking will improve eventually.\n\n# Sustainable Development Goal 2\n\n[https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2)\n\nThe SDG demands many.\n\nLet me pull out the key gist:\n\n&gt; 2(a) Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries \n\n"To reduce our dependence on import of oilseeds, a rationalised and comprehensive scheme to increase domestic production of oilseeds will be implemented.  "\n\n "For delivery of digital and hi-tech services to farmers with involvement of public sector research and extension institutions along with private agri-tech players and stakeholders of agri-value chain, a scheme in PPP mode will be launched. "\n\n" Use of ‚ÄòKisan Drones‚Äô will be promoted for crop assessment, digitization of land records, spraying of insecticides, and nutrients. "\n\n" States will be encouraged to revise syllabi of agricultural universities to meet the needs of natural, zero-budget and organic farming, modern-day agriculture, value addition and management. "\n\n" A fund with blended capital, raised under the co-investment model, will be facilitated through NABARD. This is to finance startups for agriculture &amp; rural enterprise, relevant for farm produce value chain. The activities for these startups will include, inter alia, support for FPOs, machinery for farmers on rental basis at farm level, and technology including IT-based support."\n\n[https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget\\_Speech.pdf](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_Speech.pdf)\n\nIt seems that this was made to ensure India doesnt fail the SDG goals and ensures it sticks to the guidelines issued by the United Nations.\n\nComment if you think it\'s right.'<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'shtre4'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/shtre4/budget_2022_analysis/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Maulana Abul Kalam,India's 1st education Min &amp; rest of Indian Muslim luminaries-backed by Congress leaders like Gandhi began Khilafat in 1919 to restore Ottoman Caliphate,3 yrs after Caliphate committed Armenian genocide-1.2million Armenians killed in death marches &amp; women/kids converted to Islam"<br />Body: 'The Armenian genocide was the systematic destruction of the Armenian people and identity in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Spearheaded by the ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), it was implemented primarily through the mass murder of around one million Armenians during death marches to the Syrian Desert and the forced Islamization of Armenian women and children.\n\nPrior to World War I, Armenians were concentrated in eastern Anatolia and occupied a protected, but subordinate, place in Ottoman society. Large-scale massacres of Armenians occurred in the 1890s and 1909. During their invasion of Russian and Persian territory in 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians. Ottoman leaders took isolated indications of Armenian resistance as evidence of a widespread rebellion, even though no such rebellion existed. Mass deportation was intended to permanently forestall the possibility of Armenian autonomy or independence.\n\nOn 24 April 1915, the Ottoman authorities arrested and deported hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and leaders from Constantinople. At the orders of Talaat Pasha, an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million Armenian women, children, and elderly or infirm people were sent on death marches to the Syrian Desert in 1915 and 1916. Driven forward by paramilitary escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to robbery, rape, and massacres. In the Syrian Desert, the survivors were dispersed into concentration camps. In 1916 another wave of massacres was ordered, leaving about 200,000 deportees alive by the end of 1916. Around 100,000 to 200,000 Armenian women and children were forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim households. Massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian survivors were carried out by the Turkish nationalist movement during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I.\n\nThe Armenian genocide resulted in the destruction of more than two millennia of Armenian civilization in eastern Anatolia.\n\nDeath marches\n\nAlthough the majority of able-bodied Armenian men had been conscripted into the army, others deserted, paid the exemption tax, or fell outside the age range of conscription. Unlike the earlier massacres of Ottoman Armenians, in 1915 Armenians were not usually killed in their villages, to avoid destruction of property or unauthorized looting. Instead, the men were usually separated from the rest of the deportees during the first few days and executed. Few resisted, believing it would put their families in greater danger.[161] Boys above the age of twelve (sometimes fifteen) were treated as adult men.[172] Execution sites were chosen for proximity to major roads and for rugged terrain, lakes, wells, or cisterns to facilitate the concealment or disposal of corpses.[171][173][174] The convoys would stop at a nearby transit camp, where the escorts would demand a ransom from the Armenians. Those unable to pay were murdered.[161] Units of the Special Organization, often wearing gendarme uniforms, were stationed at the killing sites, while escorting gendarmes often did not participate in killing.[174]\n\nAt least 150,000 Armenians passed through Erzindjan from June 1915, where a series of transit camps were set up to control the flow of victims to the killing site at the nearby Kemah gorge.[175] Thousands of Armenians were killed near Lake Hazar, pushed by paramilitaries off the cliffs.[171] More than 500,000 Armenians passed through the Firincilar plain south of Malatya, one of the deadliest areas during the genocide. Arriving convoys, having passed through the plain to approach the Kahta highlands, would have found gorges already filled with corpses from previous convoys.[173][176] Many others were held in tributary valleys of the Tigris, Euphrates, or Murat and systematically executed by the Special Organization.[177] Armenian men were often drowned by being tied together back-to-back before being thrown in the water, a method that was not used on women.[178]\n\nAuthorities viewed disposal of bodies through rivers as a cheap and efficient method, but it caused widespread pollution downstream. So many bodies floated down the Tigris and Euphrates that they sometimes blocked the rivers and needed to be cleared with explosives. Other rotting corpses became stuck to the riverbanks, while some traveled as far as the Persian Gulf. The rivers remained polluted long after the massacres, causing epidemics downstream.[179] Tens of thousands of Armenians died along the roads and their bodies were buried hastily or, more often, simply left beside the roads. The Ottoman government ordered the corpses to be cleared as soon as possible both to prevent photographic documentation and disease epidemics, but these orders were not uniformly followed.[180][181]\n\nWomen and children, who made up the great majority of deportees, were usually not executed immediately, but subjected to hard marches through mountainous terrain without food and water. Those who could not keep up were left to die or shot.[182] During 1915, some were forced to walk as far as 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) in the summer heat.[143] Some deportees from western Anatolia were allowed to travel by rail.[155] There was a distinction between the convoys from eastern Anatolia, which were eliminated almost in their entirety, and those from farther west, which made up most of those surviving to reach Syria.[183] For example, around 99% of Armenians deported from Erzerum did not reach their destination.[151]\n\nIslamization\n\nIslamization of Armenians was carried out as a systematic state policy involving the bureaucracy, police, judiciary, and clergy and was a major structural component of the genocide.[184][185] An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Armenians were Islamized,[186] and it is estimated that in the early 21st century as many as 2 million Turkish citizens may have at least one Armenian grandparent.[187] Some Armenians were allowed to convert to Islam and evade deportation, but where their numbers exceeded the five to ten percent threshold, or where there was a risk of their being able to preserve their nationality and culture, the regime insisted on their physical destruction.[188] Talaat Pasha personally authorized conversion of Armenians and carefully tracked the loyalty of converted Armenians until the end of the war.[189] Although the first and most important step was conversion to Islam, the process also required the eradication of Armenian names, language, and culture, and for women, immediate marriage to a Muslim man.[190] Although Islamization was the most feasible opportunity for survival, it also transgressed Armenian moral and social norms.[191]\n\nThe CUP allowed Armenian women to marry into Muslim households, as these women had to convert to Islam and would lose their Armenian identity.[173] Young women and girls were often appropriated as house servants or sex slaves. Some boys were abducted to work as forced laborers for individual Muslims.[173][192] Some children were forcibly seized, but others were sold or given up by their parents to save their lives.[193][194] Special state-run orphanages were also set up with strict procedures intending to deprive their charges of an Armenian identity.[195] Most Armenian children who survived the genocide endured exploitation, hard labor without pay, forced conversion to Islam, and physical and sexual abuse.[192] While Armenian women captured during the journey ended up in Turkish or Kurdish households, those who were Islamized during the second phase of the genocide found themselves in an Arab or Bedouin environment.[196]\n\nThe rape, sexual abuse, and prostitution of Armenian women were all very common. Military commanders told their men to "do to them whatever you wish".[197] Although Armenian women tried to avoid sexual violence, suicide was often the only alternative.[198] Deportees were displayed naked in Damascus and sold as sex slaves in some areas, constituting an important source of income for accompanying gendarmes.[199] Some were sold in Arabian slave markets to Muslim Hajj pilgrims and ended up as far away as Tunisia or Algeria\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide\n\nThe Khilafat movement or the Caliphate movement, also known as the Indian Muslim movement (1919‚Äì24), was a pan-Islamist political protest campaign launched by Muslims of British India led by Shaukat Ali, Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan,[1][2] and Abul Kalam Azad[3] to restore the caliph of the Ottoman Caliphate, who was considered the leader of the Muslims, as an effective political authority. It was a protest against the sanctions placed on the caliph and the Ottoman Empire after the First World War by the Treaty of S√®vres.[4][5]\n\nAlthough political activities and popular outcry on behalf of the caliphate emerged across the Muslim world, the most prominent activities took place in India. A prominent Oxford educated Muslim journalist, Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar had spent four years in prison for advocating resistance to the colonial government and support for the caliphate.\n\nMohammad Ali and his brother Maulana Shaukat Ali joined with other Muslim leaders such as Pir Ghulam Mujaddid Sarhandi, Sheikh Shaukat Ali Siddiqui, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Raees-Ul-Muhajireen Barrister Jan Muhammad Junejo, Hasrat Mohani, Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, Mohammad Farooq Chishti, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Dr. Hakim Ajmal Khan to form the All India Khilafat Committee. The organisation was based in Lucknow, India at Hathe Shaukat Ali, the compound of Landlord Shaukat Ali Siddiqui. They aimed to build political unity amongst Muslims and use their influence to protect the caliphate. In 1920, they published the Khilafat Manifesto, which called upon the British to protect the caliphate and for Indian Muslims to unite and hold the British accountable for this purpose.[12] The Khilafat Committee in Bengal included Mohmmad Akram Khan, Manruzzaman Islamabadi, Mujibur Rahman Khan and Chittaranjan Das.[13]\n\nIn 1920 an alliance was made between Khilafat leaders and the Indian National Congress, the largest political party in India and of the nationalist movement.[14] Congress leader Mohandas Gandhi and the Khilafat leaders promised to work and fight together for the causes of Khilafat and Swaraj. Seeking to increase pressure on the colonial government, the Khilafatists became a major part of the non-cooperation movement. Some also engaged in a protest emigration from North-West Frontier Province to Afghanistan under Amanullah Khan.[15] Khilafat leaders such as Dr. Ansari, Maulana Azad and Hakim Ajmal Khan also grew personally close to Gandhi. These leaders founded the Jamia Millia Islamia in 1920 to promote independent education and social rejuvenation for Muslims.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khilafat_Movement'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'sh00mc'<br />Score:108<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sh00mc/maulana_abul_kalamindias_1st_education_min_rest/</li>

I‚Äôd be really grateful if you could read my post, even if you can‚Äôt, Inappreciate your time, and am sorry for popping up in your feed.'<br />Body: 'I‚Äôm reposting from other subreddits because I‚Äôm desperate enough to land me a job that allows me to pay for even groceries for the month:\n\n\nIs there anything you have I could do please?\n\nHi.\n\n\nI\'m from Lucknow. 19. Male. Was supposed to get into college this year but because of some rather tragic sequence of events, I couldn\'t get into (unlike what my family and myself had expected) an IIT. Neither could my family afford (i think out of prestige, more than anything else) to send me to a private college...\n\n\nI\'m authoring this post out of desperation more than anything else...desperation, frustration, self-pity, call it whatever. \n\n\n\nMy mom and I have been trudging against poverty and my father\'s alcoholism for a little over 10 years now. My mom worked odd jobs to break bread for our rather itty-bitty family. She\'s been working WITHOUT pay for almost a couple of years now ( since the start of the pandemic, really) as a teacher at a private school that is, if I daresay, run by a family of crooks. I\'ve been against her taking up this job since Day 1, but hey, what does a kid know, right?\n\n\nPlease dont take me otherwise, I\'m sure everyone\'s mom is really sweet and kind but my mom is.....I dont know how to say it other than: INNOCENTLY STUPID. She\'s way too gullible, and I couldn\'t keep track of the number of peplr who take advantage of her innocence (or stupidty, like most will put it) on a daily basis. She\'s almost 55, works over 10 hours a day FOR FREE (social service, as she keeps tellng hereelf), takes care of my grandma, of her house, teaches underprivildged kids in our neighborhood and puts up with my handicapped dad, and hid crippling alcohism...\n\nMy mom and I have been aided (both, emotionally and financially) by mom\'s sister (god bless her soulf) who\'s fairly well off but is sending her son off to college abroad on a loan, so she\'s not in a very secure financial spot right now herself, and my mom and I respect and are indebted to whatever she\'s done for us over the years, regardlesss... \nI\'ve always been a rather bright kid. My mom and honestly even myself, really expceted me to drag ourseleves out of this hell we call life, into one we\'d actually want to live in. But last year, my dad splurgled all the money my mom had saved on alcohol (and maybe some other stuff, only god knows at this point), which caused me a great deal of mental agony, as well as caused me to NOT SIT FOR COLLEGE ENTRACES. My mom supported me, let me know that she understood. And I know she does.\n\nRecently, my mom came home crying, sobbing because she\'s now been laid off from work. They laid her off and have made it pretty obvious that they\'ll not be paying her a dime. \n\nShe potrays herself as a very strong woman( and I have no doubts about it) but she\'s been secretly sobbing and whimpring for nights now in a row now... \n\nWhenever I presented myself infront of her  in doubt about our poor financial security, she used to say "God\'s looking out after us"\n\n\nI have a really severe case of stutter, that has caused me to be of rather limited ability in person, but I think I might make myself over web. As much as I really don\'t want to,  I dread the day she gives up, the day she isnt left with enough to buy rations isnt too far. I always thought id be able to fix everyhing once I get into college, but maybe i dont have the luxury of waiting that long \n\n\n\nMy mom would never want her son to beg, but I\'m forced to ask: Do any of you think you have a job I could take up? I\'m willing to do anything for any sum of money as long as its not illegal or immoral.\n\n\nThank you and may god bless us all,'<br />Author: 'ThrowAwayNinja007'  id: 'sgaqte'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sgaqte/hi_id_be_really_grateful_if_you_could_read_my/</li>

But should you Buy the Smartphone? If you have looked the device you would say why Shouldn‚Äôt I ? \n\n The fact is Micromax‚Äôs Poor After Sales Improvement and Software Updates. Before you go into the comment section to mark me as a anti-national for not supporting the Indian Compainies please take some time to read the article till end and then make your decision. \n\n## The IN Note 1 Story\n\nGood Hardware But?\n\nMicromax IN Note 1, the smartphone from the homegrown manufacturer Micromax came into limelight when it was launched back in 2020. The device was appreciated by many as it offered a good hardware at the price point of sub 12K smartphone segment.\n\nIf you remember correctly the device had got some issues like Back Panel Coming Off, Quality issues, etc. In addition there were a lot of software bugs including poor software optimsation which lead to charging issues ( would take insanely high time to charge ), camera app lags, etc.\n\nThankfully Micromax did a good job by fixing most of the issues by software updates and ensuing that the back panel doesn‚Äôt come off quicky.\n\n## Non Regular Software Updates\n\nWho likes to have Android 10 in 2022?\n\nEverything was going good, the anti China sentiment which eradicated Vivo from the Title Sponsor for IPL 2020, so was the smartphone market. Micromax sensed this opportunity and announced they are coming back into the market. And as we know their products IN Note 1 and IN 1B were highly appreciated.\n\nMicromax infact ran its own forums like forums.micromaxinfo.com, Micromax In Note 1 Android 10 Kernel Source was Released and Android 11 Beta was announced for the users who opted it in March 2021.\n\nAll seemed to be good but there was a evil coming. First the Early Android 11 Update Got Delayed. Then IN Note 1 Got its last update on May 2021 and since then there has been no update.\n\n The users have been complaining of all the trust which they had shown in Micromax, was shattered with no timely updates as they had earlier promised ‚Äì The 2 Year Software Update Promise. \n\n  \n\n## After Sales Service\n\nDon‚Äôt mind being on Android 10? So this might be another issue\n\nWhile most users don‚Äôt mind which android version your smartphone is running on as long as your smartphone is running smooth. Right?\n\nBut what if I tell you Sofware isn‚Äôt that big problem as the After Sales Services? You might be thinking why do you need it in the first place if your smartphone is running fine.\n\nThe thing is a lot of users have complained that their IN Note 1 battery got swollen. Majority of the users had this problem after 5-6 months. To which Micromax has a say that they will replace all those batteries for free if you have the smartphone within 1 year. Yes, Micromax offers 1 year warranty on its accessories like battery, charger, etc.\n\nSwollen Battey Pics : [https://gag4n.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG\\_20220130\\_144353\\_878.jpg](https://gag4n.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_20220130_144353_878.jpg)\n\n \n\nOn Paper, its so soothing but in Reality‚Ä¶ most users have complained that they had to leave their smartphone with the service center guys for as long as 1 month with averaging 15 days to get their batteries replaced.\n\nNot only this there might be a case where you damage the screen due to your mistake and what will be your reaction if you hear you have to leave the phone for at least 2 weeks at the service center.\n\nIt sums up that as long as you don‚Äôt give your users a Good After Sales Service, you won‚Äôt become the brand you were before.\n\n**SUGGESTED** [Micromax : Nothing Like Anything Comeback ‚Äì Part 2 ‚Äì The Solutions and Hope](https://gag4n.com/micromax-comeback-case-study-part-2/) \n\nOriginally Posted on [Gag4n.com](https://gag4n.com/micromax-comeback-case-study-part-1/)'<br />Author: 'Gag4n'  id: 'sg8ntc'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sg8ntc/micromax_nothing_like_anything_comeback_part_1/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'After ravaging United Kingdom, the grooming epidemic has finally reached India, and we need to protect our daughters from these predators'<br />Body: '  \n\nIn 2012, a scandal rocked England to its foundations. Girls as young as 11 years old were groomed and raped. They were passed around the pedophile gangs where the gang members took their turns to rape these minor girls. It started with just one city, but as the awareness of the workings of such grooming gangs spread, multiple hotspots were reported all over England.\n\nSome of the victims were as young as 13. Most were under 15. And all were raped and gangraped multiple times.\n\n# The groomers used simple tactics that would work on any gullible underage girl going through the turbulent time of adolescence ‚Äì\n\n1. 1. A young-looking man was sent to love-trap the targeted underage girl. He was usually chosen because he was handsome and charming. \n2. 2. After the man makes the underage girl his ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù by lying to her, he then asks her if she would like to meet his friends. The location for such a meet would usually be a party with a promise of alcohol and drugs.\n3. 3. The girl would usually agree to this because there is a party and then there is alcohol too.\n4. 4. When the man would take her to this location, the girl will be plied with alcohol and then all the men would take turns to rape the underage girl, until every one is satisfied.\n5. 5. The underage girl would then be threatened to keep her mouth shut and keep coming to the location so that the grooming gang could rape them again and again.\n\nThis predatory behavior was so shocking for the local governments that they literally froze when the scandal broke out. \n\nIt was mainly because some of the girls were as young as 13 ‚Äì **barely out of puberty and they had been gangraped by over 50 men in just one year.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake a look at this headline by an English Tabloid calling the rapists ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù instead of what they truly were ‚Äì Pakistani Muslims - \n\n[They would rather let their daughters be violated than call out the rapists.](https://preview.redd.it/v3p06bt9hre81.png?width=1227&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=205ca13354db4c341486310e12f9afe834f84a6d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd turns out this was not one isolated incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after a similar child sex scandal was unearthed in **Huddersfield** where more than 120 underage girls were raped by Pakistani-origin men. **Some of the girls here were as young as 11**. Yes. Eleven.\n\nThen there was the **Halifax child sex scandal** where a whopping **25 Pakistani Origin men** were arrested for raping and gangraping underage girls ‚Äì again under 18 years of age. The mode of grooming was the same.\n\nThen there was the **Derby child sex scandal** where **8 Pakistani-origin Muslim men** were arrested and jailed for raping underage girls between 12-18 years of age.\n\nThen there was the **Keighley sex abuse scandal** where **12 Pakistani Muslim men** were arrested, convicted and jailed for grooming and raping and gangraping underage girls between 12-18 years of age.\n\nThen there was the **Oxford child sex scandal** where **22 Pakistani Origin Muslim men** were arrested and convicted for grooming and raping underage girls of 11-15 years of age.\n\nThen there was the **Rotherham child sex scandal** where a mind numbing **39 Pakistani Origin Muslim men** were convicted for grooming, raping and gangraping of underage girls from the ages of 11-18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the dust settled over the decade, **estimates pegged the number of victims to be over 6000 children**. All of whom were groomed and raped and gangraped by the vile paedophile gang.\n\nImagine this happening in a first world country, a developed and industrialised country with ‚Äústellar human rights‚Äù culture. I mean, that is why so many proclaimed women move there, because it is relatively safer for women to raise female children and as a society, the country itself is safer for women. WRONG.\n\nWith all the vigilant reporting and oiled machinery of courts not burdened with 4 crore backlog cases, even they took 11 years to acknowledge that grooming and raping of children had indeed taken place.\n\n# Even in a developed country like England, there was a lot of backtracking and apologising and gaslighting about who the culprits were. In a famous report by the Home ministry this comment was made ‚Äì\n\n&gt;**‚ÄúResearch has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white. Some studies suggest an overrepresentation of black and Asian offenders relative to the demographics of national populations. However, it is not possible to conclude that this is representative of all group-based CSE offending.‚Äù**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere‚Äôs the list of groomer pedophile rapists who were arrested in the Rochdale sex ring. Please tell me where are the white and black men in it ‚Äì \n\nShabir Ahmed, Mohammed Sajid, Kabeer Hassan, Abdul Aziz, Abdul Rauf, Adil Khan, Mohammed Amin, Abdul Qayyum, Afraz Ahmed, Choudhry Ikhalaq Hussain, Rehan Ali, Kutab Miah, Mohammed Dauood, Abid Khan, Mohammed Zahid, Mahfuz Rahman, Mohammed Ishaque, Gul Zaman, Irshad Wani, Shohaib Shabbir, Joshim Miah, Ittefaq Yousaf, Mohammed Sadeer, Ashafaq Yousaf, Mohammed Miah.\n\nWhere are the whites and blacks in this list of groomers and rapists, I ask you.\n\nCan you imagine that. After every rapist of the grooming gang was found out to be a Pakistani Origin Muslim, they gave this statement, effectively creating culprits out of thin air and shifting the blame from the Pakistanis to the white and black people of England. Shameful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut even this tactic is not really that novel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Because at home in India, we have the same kind of people who are busy denying that the grooming problem exists rather than name and shame the groomers themselves - \n\nIn India, the tactics of such grooming gangs change a little bit. Here, the objective itself is not exclusively sexual exploitation. Here the reasons for grooming cuts through religion, changing demography and embarrassing the Hindu community as an achievement.\n\nBut we have not been as efficient as England in catching the culprits simply because they seem to have learned from the England fiasco, and gaslight more efficiently here. The ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù, which is basically another word for grooming in India is waved away as a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù. Most young people believe this too.\n\nAnd why wouldn‚Äôt they? **If the Home Office of United Kingdom can be arm twisted to state that there was no religious commonality in the grooming rapists, the common people in India are fair game for such gaslighting tactics.** Apparently it does not matter to common Indians or the British government that children as young as ELEVEN are being gangraped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# But we are going to highlight the cases of grooming in India. I have prepared a list of them below. Please go through them and see the truth for yourself ‚Äì\n\n**17 underage Hindu girls were sexually abused and exploited** by a gang of Muslim men in Tonk Rajasthan.

But when the girl and her family found out, they informed the police. **Malik used the name Rahul to love trap the girl.** \n\nOutcome of the case ‚Äì Filed a case against the accused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoib Pathan from Vadodara Gujarat groomed a Hindu woman and **promised her that after marriage she would be allowed to practice Hinduism.** But after marriage the woman was abused when she did her rituals and Moib‚Äôs brother Mohsin would come home and molest her. She fled and informed the police after she was **beaten black and blue because she named her son Shiva**. They put immense pressure on her to convert.\n\nOutcome of the case ‚Äì All males from the Pathan family are arrested and jailed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn another horror story, a Christian Dalit woman was groomed by **Samir Qureshi posing as Sam Martin** from Vadodara. He used the fake identity to lure her into marriage and then all hell broke loose.

All the accused family has been arrested and jailed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA **married man named Imran Ansari groomed and kidnapped** a 19 year old woman on the pretext of marriage by stating a false name.

Many Christian girls are groomed and exploited in the exact same way. Many bishops have come out publicly and spoken against the menace.\n\nBut the surprising thing is, just like in United Kingdom, there are malicious agents trying to suppress this scandal and calling it a conspiracy of sorts.\n\nIn a way they are as much responsible for the rapes as the rapists. Because they are misleading the people by tagging these cases as conspiracy.\n\nWe need to bring a nationwide law against this menace sweeping the society.\n\nOtherwise thousands of underage girls and women will be exploited and raped and groomed by these filthy people.\n\nThat‚Äôs it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources -\n\nNashim Ahmed grooms, rapes and blackmails a girl from Jabalpur Madhya

In this thread, I am happy to inaugurate a new series of Geopolitical History - do share any feedback! Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Tensions rise in Europe over Ukraine](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/putin-now-has-full-range-of-ukraine-options-including-full-scale-invasion-says-us-defence-secretary-41290205.html)\n\nEurope appears to be on the brink of yet another war, as Russian troops have amassed not just on Ukraine\'s eastern border, but also its norther border with Belarus, an ally and pseudo-puppet state of Russia. And despite Ukraine not being a member of NATO, NATO members are beginning to mobilize troops and equipment eastward into Poland and the Baltic states as a warning to Russia. In a stunning allegation, US President Joe Biden claimed that Russia may invade Ukraine in February. A key holdout remains Germany, which is almost entirely dependent on Russia for natural gas supplies, and is keeping a low profile. The Nordstream 2 pipeline from Russia has a CAATSA sanctions waiver from the US, and Germany is trying hard to keep that waiver.\n\n2. [Boris Johnson in difficult spot over parties](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-boris-johnson-health-europe-london-c7df4e92018ddf509137535b612a70f5)\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson, who has a reputation for being a party animal, is under investigation for allegedly flouting COVID restrictions in 2020 and 2021 by participating in parties at 10 Downing Street, the official seat of the UK PMO. These include a series of  ‚Äúbring your own booze‚Äù office parties, birthday celebrations and ‚Äúwine time Fridays.‚Äù This has led to many of Johnson\'s own party MP\'s calling for him to resign in Parliament, which he has so far refused to do. During the same period, police in the UK handed out thousands of fines (each several thousand pounds) to private parties for flouting norms.\n\n3. [New revelations about Pegasus revealed](https://news.yahoo.com/learned-pegasus-smartphone-cracker-133036366.html)\n\nThe *New York Times* released a year-long investigation into Israeli cybersecurity software Pegasus, which was revealed earlier to be a potent snooping device used by many countries all over the world. Developed by private company NSO, Israel\'s government keeps a tight leash on its use, and it has been revealed to have been used by the Israeli government as a geopolitical tool. The Abraham Accords, which led to diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab countries, have been revealed to have been signed on the condition of Israel renewing the software license of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The FBI bought the software but has so far not used it for domestic snooping in the US. The CIA purchased a license for the government of Djibouti, which houses both Chinese and American military bases. The Indian govt is learned to have purchased the software as part of a larger arms deal, which made Israel the country\'s second-largest arms supplier after Russia.\n\n4. [China set to host Winter Olympics](https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics-opening-ceremony-china-guest-list-194946953.html)\n\nA decade and a half after China splashed on to the world stage by hosting the Summer Olympics, the winter version of the international sporting event is set to be held in Beijing, a city that does not have permanent snow. The games will be held instead only on artificial snow. The US and much of the West have led a diplomatic boycott of the games, meaning that no diplomatic delegates will participate in the opening or closing ceremonies. Nonetheless, the opening ceremony guest list is packed, with Russian President Putin being the personal guest of CCP dictator Xi Jinping. Other guests include the leaders of Singapore and Cambodia from ASEAN, the Central Asian "stans," major Gulf countries, and just a handful of smaller European countries. China has been testing almost the entire city every day for the Omicron variant, and has brushed off accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang as it hosts the event.\n\n5. [EU fights China at the WTO over Taiwan spat](https://apnews.com/article/business-china-beijing-global-trade-taiwan-4f242182421d1fc864ee751d158c046c)\n\nA dispute between Communist China and EU member Lithuania is going to the WTO. The dispute is around the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the country, which serves as a de facto embassy for Taiwan in many countries (including one in New Delhi). This is because most countries follow the One China policy and do not have de jure diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and hence no formal embassies. The dispute is over Lithuania allowing the TECRO office to use the name "Taiwan" instead of "Taipei," which seems insignificant but has angered the CCP. Beijing has since used trade as a weapon, cutting off a lot of exports from Lithuania for conjured up, non-trade reasons, in violation of its WTO obligations. The EU has now taken the issue to the WTO, warning China not to weaponize trade to coerce one of its member states. China has shot back that all EU countries should respect China\'s territorial integrity. Australia is also learned to have joined the dispute, having been subject to China\'s trade weaponization recently as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Children of Sykes-Picot Part 1: Background\n\n*This is a new series discussing the history of the countries in the Middle East that were born of the Sykes-Picot pact.*\n\nThe Arab World - stretching from the shores of Morocco in the west to the borders of Iran in the east, and with a sizable diaspora in the rest of the world - plays an outsized role in the modern world. It is the source of a large share of the world\'s crude oil, home to one of the wealthiest cities (Dubai), encompasses the descendants of ancient civilizations (Egypt and Mesopotamia to name just two), and is the home of holy sites for Muslims around the world. If the Arab World were a single country, the dream of Arab nationalists, it would surely be a great power. And yet, it is split up into dozens of countries, some plagued by poverty, others by excessive wealth, almost none of them a democracy, and almost all in some state of conflict. How did this come to pass? In this new series, *The Children of Sykes-Picot*, I will take you through the modern history of the richest and most volatile part of the Arab world - the Middle East.\n\nBut let\'s take a momentary step back. Who are Arabs, exactly? They are an ethnic group characterized by the language they speak - Arabic, a Semitic language (Hebrew is another famous language in the same family). While the spoken form has many dialects, some of them unintelligible to each other, the written form is virtually uniform. Arabs as a people have been referenced from literature dating back to the 9th Century BCE, originating in what is today Syria and parts of the northern Arabian peninsula. They were dispersed into many tribes, mostly living in the desert. However, it was the Prophet Muhammad who rose to unite Arabs into a single nation - a seminal moment in the history of the world, when a hitherto desert people expanded outward, spreading their language, culture, and new religion to the rich lands of Persia, India, Egypt, Africa, and Europe, more often than not by conquest. \n\nBut even as the borders of the empire continued to ebb and flow under a series of caliphates, the heartland of the Arab world - Egypt, the Levant (around modern Syria, Palestine, and Jordan), and the Arabian Peninsula - maintained relative peace. Trade brought great prosperity - by being the intermediaries between India and China to the east and (Byzantine) Rome and other European empires to the west, Arab merchants prospered and enriched the empire. There, money flowed freely for the translation of the great books of knowledge from the east, most famously of course, the decimal system of numbers from India. At the crossroads of the world, the Arab empire was a great power. And as all great empires do, it too fell.\n\nAs the Islamic empire grew to encompass vast non-Arabic people, the Arabs themselves were soon overshadowed by the richest and most prosperous part of the empire, Persia. Then, in the 11th century AD, To the northeast of the empire, in what is today Mongolia, a Perso-Turkic warlord named Seljuk conquered Central Asia and Persia, and then continued further east into Baghdad and finally Anatolia (modern Western Turkey), where his army was halted by the Roman (Byzantine) Empire and the Crusades from Europe. They finally settled down to form the Seljuk Empire, in control of Arab lands in Asia, but in a state of perpetual war with Rome. The coming of the Mongols destroyed this tense status quo, breaking up the Seljuk Empire into many small kingdoms ("Beyliks"), often led by former generals who survived the Mongol massacres. One of these was Osman I, who eventually reunified the Beyliks and annexed Arab lands to form the Ottoman Empire (Ottoman is a Latinized form of Osman, which itself is a Turkified form of the Arabic Uthman). The Ottoman Empire continued to expand, conquering the Balkans and eventually defeating and annexing Europe\'s richest and best-defended city, Constantinople (modern Istanbul), bringing an end to the Roman Empire. \n\nIn the great wars of expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the Arabs played dual roles: both as soldiers of the emperor, as well as a people perpetually suspected of treason. The Ottoman Emperor, who was also Caliph of the Muslims, aimed to Turkify all the people in his lands, and that was a problem for Arabs. The official administration was in Turkish (albeit written in the Perso-Arabic script, Nastaliq), as was all education. Elite culture was Turkish and Persian, with Arabic culture shorn as being that of peasants and the illiterate. The only semblance of Arabic left was in the Quran as well as control over the mosques in Mecca and Medina, in the western part of the Arabian peninsula along the Red Sea called Hejaz. Worse, the Ottomans proved to be rather tolerant, allowing many Jews and Christians to continue to practice their faith, even decriminalizing homosexuality for a few years in a fit of reforms! These groups eventually became more educated and prosperous as compared to the Arabs, creating strong resentment. \n\nIn short, by the end of the 19th century, the Arabs were a weak and conquered people - their empire having grown so big and so fast that they became a colony of their former colonies, with only Islam providing a tenuous bond. Anger and resentment festered, and pan-Arab nationalism began to rise, hoping to create an Arab homeland. Most uprisings were crushed. At the dawn of World War I in Europe, only one Arab had any significant say in the Ottoman Empire: Sharif Hussein bin Ali, the custodian of the two holy mosques, based in the city of Mecca in the Hejaz region. Belonging to the House of Hashim (their lineage being traced to the grandfather of the prophet), today called Hashemites, he played a decisive role in the creation of the modern Middle East. In the next few months, we will see how each of the countries in the region were formed after the Ottoman defeat in WW1, and how they reached the position that they are in today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have an interesting story from the world of geopolitics to share?

      <li>Title::: 'why the f***k do they lie ?'<br />Body: "first they said let's build this nation by shoving the horrible medieval turk time under the carpet, making up shit stories like ganga-jamuni (which happens to be name of a bhaang, no joke, check Shabdasagara)\n\n2010s were a landslide meltdown of this consensus. Ok, fine, I think most sane Hondus are over it. [some wankers might still be stuck there bt who cares, fck em]\n\nComing to 2010s and RSS, which has own version of lying to masses. They too cook up stories, but of the other kind. I am gonna throw the R word (raita) here to avoid triggering RSS people, but these guys have spawned perhaps equal and in fact much more despicable lies. That is of mainstreaming batshit ideas which may have destructive effect in the future.\n\nLet me list out some of their fcked up lies..and these chutiyas fiddle with religion ffs, which at least the earlier consensus didn't, bcz they were undisclosed adversaries.\n\n1. All Indians share the same DNA.. not only this is pathetically wrong, they even claim that it has remained unchanged for some gaziliion years. \n\n2. Aryabhatta was a dalit.\n\n3. Valmiki was a dalit\n\n4. Veda Vyasa was a dalit.. this dalit thing is funny bcz the historicity of guys above is fairly obscure, we dont even know the exact historicity of 2 of them. Also we should know that usage of dalit word as a community identifier is fairly recent. All in all, in effect, Veda Vyasa and dalit are anachronic. Its like saying Veda Vyasa was a liberal democrat, looking at his political views, expressed in his dialogue in Bharata. Makes zilch sense. \n\n5. Varna is karma, karma is varna and other such elaborate non sense, which makes no sense traditionally and even practical experience. Now, we may know internally, that this is being done to bolster Hindu Unity, by cooking up fake antecedants. But I dont see how this helps, the so called disadvantaged communities have real identities, at least some of them even today want to wear it with dignity, which they should as they were professionals in crafts that were once niche, they were part of a glorious civilization. \nRather than encouraging them to carry their past with dignity, they invent new ones, WHILE simultaneously encouraging castes to be termed officially Backward, as in the reservation politiks. Can you see the unresolvable paradox that has been sown ?\n\n7. Twisting ancestry historical icons like Raja Bhoja etc. for petty political gains. This is the same trope I said above, fcking up with history for Hindu Unity. \n\n8. Not to miss is the absolute nationalization of relatively lesser known icons like Phules, Periyar and Ambedkar, at least 2 of them could be inferred as British stooges and all 3 had directly cursed Hindu ideals. [ inb4 some chutiya Ranganathan fan comes and shits that how genius Ambedkar invented Reimannian Geometry by his left hand while sleeping ]\n\n9. RW encourages people to be incessantly insecure about their religious future, meanwhile peddling same DNA theories. Now, this may be a quintessential feminine move, of beauty seducing the beast, but ffs whats the grand plan here, are they thinking of seducing them ALL ?\n\nNow, don't assume that I am misreading RSS here.. NO, boring detail that I have been following their top intellectual brass since the time maybe you were a lib***u. RSS core intellectual brass actually THINKS Dara Shikoh was a missed shot, and we were on verge of seducing the beast. The Birbal Kool Aid. \n\nNow what is wrong with the Birbal Kool Aid ?\n\n&gt;Birbal Kool Aid requires toning down the dogmas in your religion, and inventing universalities, where they may be none. There were have been 4 waves of such universality assertions in Indian civilization, one was at the Shankaracharya. 2nd time of Beerbal, 3rd at the time of Orientalism prime, 4th during Hippie era. \nThe cost of such universal assertions is that one exposes its own culture to contradictions, and in case of the last 2 specially, our own people fell for the meme more than the others. \n\n**Thanks to such universality assertions, world is now filled with midwit Indians writing paragraphs on what Hinduism is, while never really being one.**\n\n&gt;RW has raised an army of Hinduism explainers, all of whom could be mockingly termed as Hindic Presenticus as opposed to Hindic Nominalis and Hindic Classical.\n\nHindic Classical being a Hindu who has always been one, doesnt write long paragraphs on what it is, its hermeneutics, its exegesis, skoda laura.. He is more devoted to prime subjects of his life, his devatas etc.\n\nHindic Nominalis is Hindu who is carrying a Hindu identity, falls for Enlightenment era memes all the time. Is carrying dichotomies of the world with him, demorcracy vs monarchy, liberalism vs conservatism, x vs y.. basically a complete wanker. Waits for the next Devdutt Pattnaik book.\n\nHindic Presenticus is the pain.. Oh god.. yours truly has been one. Its like my early life was HIndic Classical and youth was Presenticus and later youth is being spent in analysing wtf I was doing..\n\nThis applies to a lot of guys here.. so hear.. if you are still not triggered and left already. \n\nHindic Presenticus is the Hindu, who wants to be a Hindu, but because of living in an modern/post modern world, can't rid himself off the grindset and memes of the day. This conflict makes him an unabashed but compromised spokesperson of Hindu principles. Most of his time is spent forcefitting modern concepts into the framework of Hinduism.. and English language is the unknown carrier. His inability to comprehend, and connect with the past, makes him imagine past in often convenient ways.. as a result, he is able to present Hinduism not as it is.. but as something that seems goood. \n\nThe major threat with presenticus is that he is the guy who is trying to fight the quicksand, he is the quintessential child of Orientalism. That he sees Indian past as mystery only, not as inheritance. He sees his own society as object of bureaucratic reform, not as groups of families held by the same gods they revere.\n\nAnd yes, Hindic Presenticus is the one, who would replace all he with she because he adapts the most. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nokie"<br />Author: 'ardraputra'  id: 'sfm2ks'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sfm2ks/why_the_fk_do_they_lie/</li>

Over the past many months, I have observed that a lot of ‚Äòanti-women‚Äô posts (inappropriate memes and random text posts) get a fair bit of engagement (at least 4-5 comments) and rarely do these posts get called out. \n\nFor instance, today‚Äôs top post (with over 400 upvotes as of now) is a meme denigrating people for fighting for causes such as workplace rights, the gender pay gap, etc. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but this made me so uncomfortable for a number of reasons. \n\nAre you only supposed to fight for the worst issues if there are several present? Workplace harassment and discrimination, wage gap, toxic attitudes are REAL issues that women face. Solely because someone may have it worse, it doesn‚Äôt mean that these issues become invalid. It‚Äôs like telling someone they can‚Äôt cry if they break their hand because there are people with cancer. \nThe same people who ridicule people for fighting against trafficking, grooming, abuse etc., (oh what will sheltered Lavanya from Delhi with her four Porsches know about trafficking) are the same who gatekeep which causes need to fought for. Who are you to decide? People usually tend to fight for issues that affect them to some degree personally. \n\nThe truth (as bitter as it is, evidenced by few of the replies on today‚Äôs post) remains that India isn‚Äôt as great as it COULD be for women. I do not consider myself a ‚Äòradical feminist‚Äô by any means and have always advocated for gender-neutral laws. I also don‚Äôt subscribe to cancel culture and remember telling my friends during the whole Me Too era to not make snap judgements based on one side of things. Despite all of that, the post really rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nInsidious oppression is being afraid to step out late at night, being unable to find a groom because your parents can‚Äôt afford dowry, your family spending more on your brother‚Äôs education than your own, people insinuating that you got your promotion because you‚Äôre pretty and must have slept with your boss, etc. You don‚Äôt have to be trafficked, abused and raped for it to be considered oppression. \n\nI am not an activist for women‚Äôs causes, but this subreddit always seemed like a balanced, sensible place (compared to the other India centric subreddits) so the anti-women rhetoric I come across every now and then is disappointing.'<br />Author: 'jagadodharana'  id: 'sfd9gn'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sfd9gn/bring_on_the_downvotes_but_i_feel_like_this/</li>

The climate is great, the roads are clean, the housing is clean, the women are beautiful and comfortably hang out till 2-3am in the night. This is one of my top picks. However social life wise the city is very boring and flat. There are clubs/pubs/restos etc but recreationwise the amount of people pursuing hobbies,sports,culture etc is very less and coming from Mumbai the social life here feels very boring. The city feels more of a retirement place than a very happening place. Not sure if I would want to live here forever\n\nBangalore: I loved the climate of Bangalore when I lived there. The only place in the country where the climate was better than Pune. The social life here is great. Quite a few meetups/house parties too. Very happening and Mumbaiesque. However in the one week that I was here, I legit got stuck in traffic so many times. Like taking 30 minutes to travel 1km. Not only the traffic but the way the city is designed is a mess. Like an urban dystopia waiting to happen. Everything is cramped. Not bad as Mumbai but can be just as bad in the future. I did not get to experience the dating life here so I am curious how open-minded this city is compared to Mumbai/Pune. I am curious how the high prevalence of IT (usually majority men) skews the dating. I wonder if men heavily outnumber the women here and if the mindset of the women is as open as it is in Maharashtra\n\nGoa: Probably the most open-minded place in India. I havent lived in the city but have visited North &amp; South Goa multiple instances. Loved the open-minded in culture and that people can do whatever they want, wear whatever they want etc. Ton of beautiful landscapes within Goa too, something which is a bit of a miss in other cities. However I don't know what living here would be like. From what I've heard the locals are quite xenophobic. I don't know what the dating/social life here is like. I dislike the monsoon and humidity strongly here.\n\nChandigarh: Loved the infrastructure of this city and the civic sense. Loved the greenery. While the weather is on the harsher side, its still doable for me. People are so good-looking here! However again, the social life here feels very boring and flat. Feels like a retirement city. Also from what I've heard from the friends there, it seems casual dating or even dating is not so well accepted here yet. People are still warming up to it. Please correct me if I am wrong and let me know how open-minded the people are here\n\nIndore: Freaking loved the roads and cleanliness here, although the traffic sense was quite bad. Good climate and love the sweet hindi spoken here but I am clueless about the dating scene and social life here. Based on my instincts either doesn't seem very open. Please tell me more about Indore\n\nNote: I do not want to live outside India. I do not want to live in Kolkata, Mumbai or Delhi. I've lived in these cities and while the social life/dating life is great in both the cities and a lot of pockets of the cities are very open-minded, there are a lot of other aspects of these cities which make me hate them and unliveable. I have since shifted to Pune and really like it much more than Mumbai but the social life recreation wise is very one-dimensional and boring here compared to Mumbai and I am since then peaking over the fences all over the country to see where the grass is greener"<br />Author: 'RantsnShitpostsIndia'  id: 'se71mq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/se71mq/cities_where_dating_is_slightly_less_difficult/</li>

Signalling networks'<br />Body: '*‚ÄúLet it be known, for centuries forth: that Magadha, after her conquest of Mathura, found herself conquered by her.‚Äù*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/19/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER 3: Yavana Kanda ("The Greek Chapter")** \n\n**‚Äî3.1. Signalling networks‚Äî**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*\\[In  Sakala\\] the women, drunk and naked, laugh and dance outdoors in the  city; unadorned with garlands or unguents, they drunkenly sing various  obscene songs that are as musical as a donkey\'s bray or a camel\'s bleat.  They are without restraint in intercourse as in all other matters; in  drunken madness they call each other various endearing epithets. Making  drunk cries to their husbands, these fallen women give themselves up to  dancing without observing restrictions even on sacred days.*\n\n*What man would willingly dwell, even for a moment, among these fallen, depraved Valhikas?*\n\n*Crossing  the Sutlej, returning to my own country, I await to cast my eyes again  upon the beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing stickers  of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium  on their eyes!*\n\n‚ÄîMahabharata 8.44\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*In the 163th year of Magadha hegemony*\n\n*(329 BC)*\n\n*All human actions are transactions, including the pleasurable interactions between a man and a woman.*\n\n*When,  due to the difficulty of the task or the beholder\'s lack of  intellectual capacities, the value of a transaction becomes difficult to  judge, the beholder resorts to relying on the judgement of others. This  is how even the uneducated know to pay respects to scholars of  intellectual and masculine gait and clothing, and this is why a woman\'s  admiration of a man is based on his appraisal by others; while among  civilized women these others are her parents, among barbarians, these  are her companions of similar age.*\n\n*Such people may be  deceived easily by adopting false appearances. Thus the argument for why  a government must be wary of heretical ascetics.*\n\nWhy, one  might ask, had Professor Chanakya tasked his dearest student with the  assignment of seducing Scythian women at a feast in Pushkalavati?\n\nTypically,  the method of seduction was employed by female spies to extract  information from important men ‚Äì but the Scythians had the fatal habit  of disclosing secrets to women to impress them ‚Äì apart from women who  themselves held political power. Minor leaks and rumours were thus  widely circulated in gossip, but the wives and mistresses of men of true  importance were somewhat more cautious about whom they chose to share  their husbands\' secrets with, and thus extracting these secrets required  more effort.\n\nWhile men tended to reveal secrets in order to lay  with a woman, the Professor had explained, women tended to reveal  secrets after laying with a man ‚Äì for they regarded their own affections  as trust, and to reveal secrets then felt no different to them from  revealing secrets to their husbands.\n\nOf all the tasks that  Chanakya had ever assigned him, none had made Chandragupta ‚Äì no,  Shashigupta ‚Äì quite as nervous as this one. He had faltered in the past ‚Äì  not realizing that unlike civilized women, Bactrian women were not  charmed by teaching them facts of geometry and grammar.\n\n*You are the prot√©g√© of the greatest living mind in the world,* he reminded himself.\n\n*You are a man of civilization, amongst lowly barbarians.* \n\n*You are the future emperor of the world* (a tinge of guilt hit him then, for he wasn\'t sure what Chanakya\'s plans were with Pabbata) *‚Äì  these women would regard it an honour to have ever received your  attention; such will fill your harem; how silly would your current  nervousness appear then?*\n\nSteeling himself, Shashigupta strode  his way into the midst of a group of drunken women, outstretched his  right arm to hold out one of the red Bactrian fruits, and announced:\n\n*"TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE!"*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Zeus  is said to have invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis all the  gods except Eris (the goddess of discord). When she came later and was  not admitted to the banquet, she threw an apple through the door,  inscribed: To the Fairest One.*\n\n‚ÄîPseudo-Hyginus, Fabulae 92 (The Judgement of Paris)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and thirty six years ago.*\n\n*(465 BC)*\n\n*That morning in the city altar of Ayodhya, a sheep was sacrificed.* \n\n*Emperor Ajatashatru received the news that the city\'s king had been deposed by its Prime Minister, a certain Purushaprabhu.* \n\n*"What  is the message that they are sending us?" Prince Udayin thought aloud.  "That they celebrate the destruction of their sheep-like administration,  and welcome our rule? Or that their sheep of a king has been  eliminated, and their new administration will be more effective in  countering us?"*\n\n*Ajatashatru was annoyed by the question.*\n\n*"It  is irrelevant, my son," he replied. "What it means is that their new  administration is just as sheep-like and foolish as the previous. For if  they were truly wolves, if they were truly my worthy enemies ‚Äì or  allies ‚Äì they would not bother sending me any sort of message ‚Äì much  less a cryptic, poetic and meaningless one. The purpose of the ritual is  not to send me any message of meaning, it is to IMPRESS me."*\n\n*"And even in that purpose, they have failed," Udayin commented.*\n\n*Yet,  Ajatashatru could not quite shake off the fear that he was, for the  first time, fighting a mind equal to his own ‚Äì not only in sheer  intellect, but also in cunning and ambition.* \n\n*Upon  conquering Vaishali, Ajatashatru had set his eyes on the patchwork of an  empire that was Ayodhya\'s ‚Äì he had first urged the tribes of the  Dandaka forest, lead by Vidarbha, to rebel against South Kosala, the  state established by Prince Rama so many centuries ago. Shortly  thereafter, Princess Rukmini of Vidarbha ‚Äì who had been betrothed to  Ajatashatru ‚Äì had been mysteriously kidnapped, with clearly fabricated  incriminating evidence of an inside-job by her father. This had left  Ajatashatru with two options: to forgive the Vidarbhas and appear weak  to his own followers, or to sabotage his alliance with them.*\n\n*But  Ajatashatru was not a fool who merely responded to circumstances ‚Äì he  was creative, he was intelligent, and he played on his own terms. Thus,  he had sent spies to find the true culprits, and to locate Princess  Rukmini ‚Äì and had found her in Ayodhya with the son of Prime Minister  Purushaprabhu. But rather than taking the obvious bait ‚Äì of accusing  Purushaprabhu, having him dismissed from employment and giving the  Brahmins cause to rebel against the king and install an administration  in Ayodhya less sympathetic to Magadha ‚Äì he had chosen to instead plant  false evidence incriminating the King of Ujjain, a faraway and  irrelevant country, in Rukmini\'s abduction.*\n\n*However, it  appeared that whoever he was playing the game against had anticipated  this, and planning yet another step in advance, had caused a regime  change in Ujjain ‚Äì placing on its throne an indignant, ambitious hothead  by the name of Pradyota, who was so enraged by the accusation against  him that he marched his army to Magadha and seized large treasures, then  returned to invade and conquer Vidarbha. It had not done Ajatashatru  well to earn the ire of Pradyota, who had now apparently become a rival  empire-builder of his own, and had began to compete with him for the  alliance of Ayodhya.*\n\n*At last, after seven long years,  Ajatashatru had taken Kashi with his own forces ‚Äì and enslaving its  population to fill his army once more, declared war on the centre of  civilization itself: on the city of Ayodhya.* \n\n*Through his  march through their country, his army had been harassed by thieves,  skirmishers, poisoning attempts and seers and spies sent to demoralize  the superstitious members of his army. And after spending three years  capturing strategic forts and defeating armies sent to intercept him,  three years of dealing with unending guerrilla warfare ‚Äì he had finally  reached the frontiers of the city of Ayodhya itself, ready to cross its  uncrossable moat, to penetrate its impregnable bounds, to scale its  unscalable walls and conquer the invincible city.*\n\n*The  resistance put up by the city was unlike anything that Ajatashatru had  seen in any fort he had captured previously ‚Äì and unlike anything he had  expected from an enemy.*\n\n*For every attack, the city  launched a most creative and unusual defence or counter-attack ‚Äì they  had captured some of his mechanics to learn the secret of the catapult,  and created, in response, a more powerful bow ‚Äì the crossbow ‚Äì based on  the identical technology and mounted it on their walls to harass the  invading army. When Ajatashatru battered their walls with his catapults,  they reinforced it with rawhides and metal fibres to soften his blows;  when he attempted to burn their fortifications by launching jugs of oil  and fire-arrows at them, they repurposed their oil cauldrons ‚Äì which  were designed to be used against siege towers ‚Äì to hurl water down the  walls and extinguish the fires; when the Magadhas took advantage of  lowered visibility from the smoke and steam to charge the doors with  armoured elephants equipped with battering rams, the defenders located  them with sound. The Magadhas sowed confusion by beating drums, but even  when they made a hole in the wall at last, the insides were defended ‚Äì  not by archers as Ajatashatru had anticipated, but by fiery traps that  instantly killed the invaders; when Ajatashatru sent in soldiers in wet  clothing to avoid the flames, the fiery traps were supplemented by spike  traps.*\n\n*The Emperor of the Magadhas was impressed.*\n\n*"Are we doomed?" asked his foolish son.*\n\n*Ajatashatru  laughed. "Our goal is not to win a battle, silly boy. Our goal is the  extermination of the Ayodhyans ‚Äì and there are many means to accomplish  this. We employ this method because it is the most fun."*\n\n*All  across civilized world ‚Äì from the University at Taxila to the Port at  Anga, from the snowy mountains in the North to the ordinary ones in the  South, in royal courts and in the Annual Debates in Yajnavalkya\'s  honour, in the camps of the defenders and the attackers alike, a  mysterious name formed on the lips of men.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Air, water, earth, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and ego together constitute the nature created by me.*\n\n‚Äîquoted to Krishna, Bhagavad Gita 7.4\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and thirty two years ago.*\n\n*(461 BC)*\n\n*After four full years of siege, Ayodhya fell.*\n\n*More  holes were made in the walls of Ayodhya; more sections became  controlled by the invaders as defending them all became a war on too  many fronts.*\n\n*Pradyota, whose assistance had been  requested by Ayodhya, found himself embroiled in a civil war against a  rebellious Vidarbha. When the rebellion had finally been suppressed, the  Magadhas put ruin to the roads from his country, stalling him.*\n\n*The  Ayodhyan army continued to put a fierce resistance to Ajatashatru even  upon the breach of their walls ‚Äì almost as if their goal was not victory  itself, but merely to destroy as much of the Magadhan army as possible.  As if they wished for the destruction of their own army, only so that  it did not become Magadha\'s when they were inevitably defeated.*\n\n*"Your arrogance will be your downfall!" cried Purushaprabhu as he was tortured before the city\'s central shrine.*\n\n*"Arrogance,  arrogance! ‚Äì the three worlds chant without end: arrogance!"  Ajatashatru laughed heartily, "I\'ve become a monster, and I love it!  Why? Because I\'ve become the greatest of them ‚Äì all your tales, all your  plays will be edited in due time to make arrogance the antagonist\'s  greatest weakness. All your villains will be moulded on me, and my  personality, due to my wickedness. I love it!"*\n\n*Ordinarily,  Ajatashatru would have dismissed Ayodhya\'s actions as an irrational  display of false bravery ‚Äì but having experienced his enemy\'s genius for  himself, he could not quite help but consider that their actions were  motivated by strategy: that the enemy lied beyond Ayodhya, and was  seeking not merely to save Ayodhya, but something far greater.*\n\n*A cold, calculating intellect much like his own.* \n\n*He mouthed two syllables.*\n\n*"Krishna."*'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'sdxzpv'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sdxzpv/the_great_empire_ch_3_yavana_kanda_31_signalling/</li>

Multiple cases reported during DMK rule 2006-11.In Feb 2009,12-year-old Ranjita, committed suicide after she was forced to read Bible verses.'<br />Body: 'In the period of 2006-2011, when the DMK was in power in Tamil Nadu and UPA was in power in the Centre, multiple cases of children committing suicide in Christian-mission run schools got reported in the local news in Tamil Nadu.\n\nForced Religious Conversion Kills A Child In Tamil Nadu, Again \nIn November 2006, there was the suicide of Omallur Sukanya. Sukanya was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the Fatima School campus, a school run by Catholic missionaries. When a minister from the then ruling DMK requested the diocese to transfer the staff because of public anger, the Salem Bishop replied that being a minority institution, they do not have to agree to that demand.\n\nThe Thuglak reported on 25 July 2007 that forensic evidence suggested that the girl had been sexually abused.\n\nIn February 2009, a 12-year-old girl, Ranjita, committed suicide after she was forced to read Bible verses and was humiliated for not reading them properly. The talisman she was wearing, which was tied to her in a Hindu temple, was removed forcefully. Though the official reason cited for her suicide was that she had got low marks, many of her friends had pointed to the psychological harassment heaped on her in school.\n\nAgain, in 2009, in Chennai alone, there were two prominent reports of girls committing suicide in Christian mission-run schools. In Chennai, in the Ambattur Immanuel Methodist school, a ninth standard girl, Ramya, committed suicide after she was humiliated by the class teacher for turning up in traditional attire. She was compared to a glamorous actress who had committed suicide.\n\nNow with the suicide of the girl in Tanjore and her clear statement blaming the school official for psychological torment and pressure to change her religion, one wonders if the pro-Christian and anti-Hindu ideology of the Dravidianist polity has anything to do with such emboldened behaviour.\n\nHistorically, Paramacharya Swami Sahajananda, the great Hindu spiritual monk of Tamil Nadu, who had fought for social justice of the marginalised communities, had recorded how he was asked to convert to Christianity in the school he studied and when he refused, his father, who was poor, was forced to pay all the fees that the student had incurred. This led to the discontinuation of the education of Swami Sahajananda as a child and his parents becoming indentured labourers.\n\nGoodness knows how many more Lavanyas are suffering in present-day Tamil Nadu.\n\nNext year, when we remember Fateh Singh and Zoravar Singh, the Balidanis for Dharma on the day of Veer Bal Diwas, let us also remember children like Lavanya and Ranjita and Sukanya and Ramya...\n\nThey are the reminder to Hindu society that we have collectively and individually failed to protect our daughters from the predatory proselytising cult. And let us earnestly hope and work so that this harassment of the children of Dharma stops.\n\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/ideas/forced-religious-conversion-kills-a-child-in-tamil-nadu-again'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 's9x1nc'<br />Score:89<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s9x1nc/lavanya_is_not_the_first_child_to_have_committed/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Nothing happens by the will of Allah (GOD)'<br />Body: 'Disclaimer: I have no intentions to defame or question ALLAH(I am not an atheist and I firmly believe in ALLAH). The whole purpose of this blog will be to demonstrate you how the world and people around you from generations have brainwashed you. And you ofc you haven\'t questioned anything on these subjects till now!\n\nWell so before straight away jumping to the main topic of this blog let me take you through the small roads which I went through before driving this conclusion.\n\n\n\n**Read the blog very patiently and slowly in all your senses!**\n\n\n\nSo of course I am not a scholar or something who has done research in this field.\n\nSo my points might be wrong(ofc). So before getting triggered by any of my statements just keep in mind that any of my statements are just only and only mine and it is not harming any sort of your belief, your religion, or ALLAH.\n\nSo be patient and calm while reading out the points.\n\n\n\nSo let\'s start the journey,\n\nMy father is very fond of a Turkish TV Series named **ERTUGRUL**. And if you are not aware of what this series is all about so let me tell you that the show is based on 13th-century Turkish ruler ETUGRUL GHAZI.             \n\n\n\nIt\'s just constantly portrayed in the show that Ertugrul wants to expand ISLAM and for which if anyone will come in his path will be slaughtered to death. Which to me seems no more than the terrorist ideology of most of the terrorist groups (like ISIS). Well so once I asked my father Why did you applaud Ertugrul so much why you support him when he kills 1000s (literally each episode displays the killing of 1000 of soldiers)to which my father replies that " _Zalim ka yahi ant hota hai_ " which means " _That\'s what a fate of tyrant is_ ".\n\nWell at that point I thought ok maybe my father is right. But I never knew that his answer will arise 100s more questions inside me.\n\nThe first question which straight away came to my mind was if he is a zalim who is torturing and killing innocents WHY ALLAH IS ALLOWING HIM TO DO SO. Why ALLAH is not punishing him at that instant only?\n\nWhy Allah is just watching his innocent ummat to suffer from pain, misery, and sorrow?\n\nNo just imagine yourself in that situation where someone from your innocent family member(be it your mother, father, brother, or sister) gets slaughtered by this tyrant. Wouldn\'t you question anyone WHY GOD DID THIS TO YOU?\n\nSo I asked this question straight away to my father that if he is a zalim why ALLAH itself not stopping him. And if ALLAH is not stopping him and thus allowing him to live then who tf is this Ertugrul to take away his life? (Giving and taking life should only and only be the right of ALLAH)\n\nTo which my father politely replies that everything that happens is a willingness of ALLAH itself.\n\nErtugrul is just a medium.It\'s all the wish of ALLAH Subhanahu wa ta\'ala.\n\nWell, here one will think that yeah that\'s what a happy ending is it was the will of ALLAH and so this zalim got killed by Ertugrul.\n\nBut still, if you even go one centimeter deep in this philosophy you will eventually start seeing the flaws it has! By the time it should be very clear that this philosophy(the philosophy that GOD HAS ALREADY PRE-WRITTEN EVERYTHING &amp; whatever happens is only the will of ALLAH) has obviously many defects in it.\n\nBut if you aren\'t able to think that way(which probably most the people will be coz you have been mentally washed of by 1000s of people from ages so far and so you never ever thought it the other way!) I will make you understand it!\n\n**So firstly let\'s accept that this philosophy which people have told us for years is true!**\n\n_In a small town of Jammu&amp;Kashmir, a 6-year-old small cute girl was gang-raped by 4 people, and not only that but they eventually murdered her by burning her alive!\nSo why will ever ALLAH pre-write these things against a just small girl who is not zalim(obv) or threat to the world? She must not even have imagined what\'s right what\'s wrong and what\'s going on!\nWell, some of the people will say maybe the girl was a non-muslim (probably Hindu) NOO she was a Muslim girl named Asifa gang-raped by 4 pandits of her own town. I know it is tough to imagine the situation but just for a second imagine that she was your own small sister wouldn\'t you have questioned?_\n\nWell, some of you might have definitely thought that maybe the girl might not be good from inside. She must be an "evil soul" and must have been a danger to society! and so ALLAH decided to take away her life in THIS WAY! Well, I agree.\n\n\n\n_But what about a girl who is just born and is just 8 months old. Chalna to dur ki baat woh masoom to abhi bolna bhi nhi seekhi hai! Will ALLAH ever write her destiny that THIS 2 YOUNG MEN WILL RAPE HER TILL SHE DIES! Yeah!! that\'s what happened to her if you read the news! Will you again not question?_\n\nI am again saying it\'s never ALLAH to be questioned it\'s always the people to be questioned who told you the wrong things!\n\n_Well, even Jesus(which we all call isa masi)questioned these things! When he was crucified hanged beaten and was left with no hope.\nBlood running down all his body, nails and swords all under his stomach and intestines\nHe questioned the GOD that WHY ME? WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS TO ME? You can watch more in this [video](https://youtu.be/ewP82yBE1ks)_\n\nLet me give you Another example to understand that nothing happens in this world by the will of Allah!\n\n_"_Allah ki marzi hogi to selection zaroor hoga_"    &amp;  " _Allah ki marzi nhi rahi hogi islie iska selection nhi ho paya!_" is not true at all! Allah won\'t influence the test and the competition at all!\n\nAgar is bachhe ki khud ki marzi hogi to zaroor selection hoga aur agar iski marzi nhi hai to Allah ki marzi jaisi koi chiz exist hi nhi karti hai!\n\nNo just think for yourself what people say is ki "_dua karo iska selection ho jae_"\nI mean why tf Allah is gonna do the injustice?  Just because isne dua aakar mangi thi islie iska selection karwa deta hu aur ye bachha jo do saal se mehnat kar raha hai poori sincerity se wo jae tel lene ?\n\nI mean think for yourself why will Allah be partial with the few and do the selection on the basis ki kisne zyada achhe se minnate ya dua aakar mangi thi. Yaar ye kaise samjhauüòë\n\nAchha aisa socho ki 1% hi selection ratio hai ek exam me to Allah paak kabhi bhi aisa kyu chahe ge ki iske ghar dia jala deta hu kyuki isne to har din aakr dua mangi thi preparation thodi kam reh gai bas aur kya iska karwa deta hu jaldi se\n\nAur competition ka matlab hi yehi hota hai ki agar tumhare ghar me dia jalega to padosi ke ghar me andhera aana tay hai!\n\nWhy will Allah ever want ki kiske ghar me andhera aana hai on the basis of ki kisne mere saamne zyada sir jhukaya ?_\n\nAllah isn\'t an arrogant and egoistic personality at all(which people has constantly portrayed him!)\n\n\n\n\nSo the above examples were very easy according to me to understand the flaws that philosophy has but let me take you a little deeper into the point and I will make you realize how the philosophy in itself is a paradox(philosophy contradicts itself as well!)\n\nSo the point started that Ertugrul killed the man because it was the will of ALLAH.\n\nMeaning whatsoever was happening was the will of ALLAH ----&gt; meaning that whatsoever zulm that tyrant was doing was also a will of ALLAH itself! So why will ALLAH kill him when he was only doing the things which ALLAH wrote for him to do?\n\nWell so now driving my exact opinion aka conclusion \u200bon what must have been existed and how people fabricated that statement to "_jo bhi hota hai ALLAH ki marzi se hota hai_"\n\n\n\nAllah hasn\'t had any influence on our world since the time he created it. He left us to do things on our own and everything to understand by observing things. He gave us all the things and left us to understand them from our brain which he gave! According to me, this life we have on earth is just for the sake of our tests on how we will perform by observing things. And so he won\'t influence any of our decisions etc. Everything will be kept a note of and will be questioned to us afterlife(our result day) why we did so and so. \n\nOnly one thing which has one possibility to be true mustbe that God has seen the future and is aware of everything that\'s gonna happen, How the world\'s gonna end! (with only and only our decision which we take!)He is not gonna interfere in between and whatsoever people say that this earthquake has happened because "ALLAH ka azaab aaya hai" isn\'t true at all! It\'s just our test which is going on for millions of years and god is just silently watching everything. He won\'t influence anything at all!\n\nWell, that\'s what my point was. Thanks for reading it out. I have literally so many points which I can state to prove how other things such as dua,bakrid, Quran, namaz,haj etc. all things have been fabricated by the people and is not an actual creation of ALLAH. But will stop here because if I start to speak more I am sure you will start hating me more üòÇ.

It is, but this is not what I wanted to talk about, this was just me defining my identity because it\'s essential to talk about it since it is the very basis of the experience I\'m about to shed a light on.\n\nFrom the last 19 years of my life, from what I\'ve experienced while being in this South Delhi upper class life, here\'s why I would stop worrying about the rich teenage snobs of the country leaving for US colleges en masse-\n\nI have rich friends, a plenty of rich friends, and I\'m talking about the "I come to school in a bentley" kind rich, "dad\'s net worth just tripled to 200cr" kind rich and here\'s what I\'ve observed while going through both the college admission processes, for India and for the US, as a 19M who aced all the AP exams that I took, got a 1590 on the SAT with absolutely no prep, having done several highly regarded internships in the US and playing a sport competitively at the inter-state level and well, a medal on a really prestigious government Olympian and yet....I CHOSE to stay in India, go through the whole competitive exam process and instead trying to make it here when it\'d been much much more convenient for me in the US or somewhere in Europe, and while most of my friends just kept ranting about how there was no future here and left after paying hefty to us colleges for even as low stuff as a liberal arts degree, and well their daddies paying in crores just to ensure them an entry, here\'s why as a country we shouldn\'t exactly worry about their departure-\n\n1. Indians living here don\'t understand the US very well, the first assumption that we make when we see NRIs making it big there, we start stereotyping them as some sort of geniuses in their field who the Indian system failed and so they had to choose another system to showcase their "talents", that\'s simply not the case for most of them, anyone who has the genius potential to make it huge will make it regardless, it\'s not as if they strangle you on purpose here in India, it\'s just that a lot of the struggle gets bypassed in the US that we haven\'t achieved here yet, much more bueureucratic efficiency, but that pretty much it, if you choose to remain here, albeit a few extra struggles you\'re almost equally likely to make it here most of the times and here\'s why-\n\nAll the huge US college worshipping that you see in the media is not simply worth it, getting into a US school in the first place doesn\'t require much of talent or "genius" in the first place if you have the pre-reqs that they require- I.e the SATs,  an okayish school score, some ECs that they can provide you sympathy with (there\'s a reason social work is still the most valued EC in American schools for foreign students to do but not much valued among themselves domestically, my measure of value assigned being based on the acceptance rate for the different ECs out there) and well, the most valued pre-req of all, the ability to pay, and as long as you have the last one, oh boy trust me they\'ll take you in.\n\nNow these friends of mine, most of them, even the ones who went to the topmost of Unis in the US like UCB, UCSD, Duke, I\'ve worked with them, and eve n though most of these are decent people personally, when it comes to clarity in life, most of them are total snobs, and these are people from the much more intensive demographic, the PCM or PCB choosing kids, the humanities people come off as ten times worse rich snobs you\'d want to punch the first time they strike up a convo with you,anyway , well for one, these people are clouded when it comes to fair judgment, most of them, and I\'m not kidding, are the patriarchy hating kind that lived their entire life off of dad\'s fortune, the anti-religion kind even though they\'ve never been exposed to cultural extremism of any kind, the "treating NDTV as the gospel of truth" kind and the "went to the US to study but instead got into drugs and sex" kind, in fact, all my friends albeit two, hate India and the culture it represents, think the woke narrative is superior, own the latest iPhone and yet are self described "socialists" and advocate for stuff like "free kashmir" and "Krishna was a warmongering fascist".\n\nAnd I\'ve worked with these idiots trust me, I was under the illusion for pretty long that the people who make it to the US  do hold some kind of intellectual higher ground over the mainland Indians who chose to stay back, and I did not realize what a complete idiot I was until I entered their world and tried to make my mark and I did, today the same idiots are going to some of the best unis on the planet even though their profiles compared to mine sucked and they\'re only there because of their family net worth, and I chose to stay back even though I\'d completed the whole US applications process and had gotten quite a few acceptance letters from some great unis...the same people who go out there and then acts towards us mainlanders like total holier than thou snobs and then the general Indian populace starts worshipping them as some kind of idols of some God, I\'ll tell you why we\'re wrong and shouldn\'t do so-\n\n1. The US application process isn\'t exactly very talent based and objective, in fact, it\'s quite....strange....and hard to predict, you might be an absolute genius and still not make it, and you might as well be a total rich idiot and a snob and still make it, the opposite of that is also a very much possible scenario,  you won\'t get in just because you wrote a great essay and had a great sat score, and you still won\'t even if you are basically a child prodigy and wrote a 100 research papers before you were 9, it\'s so badly unpredictable that the only thing that determines your case 100% watertight for sure is if you\'re super rich or are black, in fact the US system actually penalizes Asians for the same score as compared to a black person or a Hispanic. So yes, if you\'re a genius you certainly do have a higher chance of getting in, there\'s never a guarantee, the Indian system is much more talent rewarding in that sense compared to the US.\n\nAssertion-If the above is true to a huge extent, then why would you worship the idea of simply getting into a US uni in the first place\n\n2. The culture- most people I know who migrated to the US from my personal circle albeit a few sensible people, even at the best of unis like MIT (Yes, the only few people who\'ve gotten into MIT from the country till date, quite a few of them are from my school and all of them have been great people, not the rich snobs), USC, UCB etc. All of them have had either some kind of STD scare and one of them even an abortion by now and some of them even stuff like hard drugs, alcohol and whatnot, and trust me I\'ve worked with these people quite a lot, been in the same classes as them and shared plenty of time at ECs and internships with them to know what huge entitled idiots most of them are, no real life skills, shitty theoretical knowledge and get stressed out at the very idea of hardwork, and what makes me absolutely awestruck is that a few years later people here are going to worship them simply because they are NRIs and earn a higher income even though it might be just median by the American standards. These are the same people who disgust at India for being a crime ridden society and yet won\'t mind being heckled by a homeless cokehead in the US, in fact I remembered being heckled amidst a product pitch I was to give in florida that I wasn\'t allowed to complete simply because one of these NRI snobs thought my accent was inferior and she should pitch it with her much more American accent instead and all he white girls nodded in agreement, no NRI there even batted an eye to the casual racism a yet if that happened in India to someone they would\'ve all gone out of their way to condemn this "regressive" society. \n\n3. It\'s the bloody bell curve, it\'s always the bloody bell curve, it\'s not as if all the Indians who leave here are going to be the next Sundar pichais and Satya Nadelas, statistically speaking even though I\'m no authority kn the subject,  most of them are going to end up pursuing average lives at best, being in the middle group, a small minority of them being awfully poor, and the other minority on the opposite of the spectrum awfully well, so even though people here think they lost a lot of "talent" and opportunity income to the "brain drain", they really didn\'t,  they just lost a lot of average workers, a small minority of taxi drivers and a small minority of CEOs in reality, the graph is always just really huge in the very middle and those average people migrating and sending a portion of their income back for their families is much better than them choosing to stay here, atleast for the economy, since it evens out in the long run, eventually they\'re sending almost the same amount of money back here as they would\'ve earned if they\'d chosen to stay instead since the median income in the US is much more and so you can expect a better investment from people who\'d earned much less if they\'d chosen to stay instead.\n\n4.You hear about a few geniuses who left IIT for MIT and start worshipping everyone who made it to the US, bloody bell curve, again that\'s not how it works, most of them are just people who couldn\'t make it through Indian competitive exams or were terribly scared to appear in the JEE, in fact I know people whose parents kept requesting their kids to pursue their UG here itself and have an attempt at competitive exams and not burden them financially for a US education, and yet the kid kept being a total snob, didn\'t attempt the Indian competitions because they were scared of the competition and found the curriculum too hard to prepare for and eventually got their way from their parents, this particular dude went to UMASS Amherst and people at my school still treat him as some sort of godly being who\'s gonna make it big even though every NITian or IITian outskills this person by far.\n\n3.Stop treating their achievements even if some of them do make it big as yours collectively,  trust me they couldn\'t care less, most of them absolutely abhore us mainlanders and don\'t want to contribute anything back here,the only reason they have the compulsion to keep doing so is well, because they still have family back here, stop feeding their egos\n\nAnyway, you get my point, I could say much more and the discussion is never ending but the main gist still is, stop worshipping NRIs for existing and moving out,  they did it for purely selfish reasons and don\'t reciprocate the attention you\'re giving them, and a majority of them anyway won\'t achieve anything more than than the median us lifestyle in their entire lifetime which pretty much evens out with a person staying in India over a lifetime simply considering how expensive the US  actually is for the average person and their daily needs, yes maybe a few of them might make it as big time CEOs but that\'s it, a huge majority is still going to end up as taxi drivers and grocery store owners after their expensive liberal arts degrees, they might earn more than, but they\'re also much more likely to have a rather dead lifestyle and spend much more on their daily needs, considering the fact that most of US is just dead space suburbs and small towns with 0 night life, all of US is not Cali and LA like the TV would have you believe, it\'s rather the opposite, most of the US streets go pretty much dead and unsafe after 9 and you can venture out alone even in the bigger cities, even more in the much more numerous smaller town that you\'re much more likely to immigrate to, it\'s not as if every Indian gets to go to NY or DC or Cali,  most of them end up in the south where they\'ll get shot if they step on their ultra-conservstive southern neighbor\'s lawn accidentally, so there\'s obviously a good rationale to why most NRIs are particularly pro Democrat there, simply because the other side is too hostile to them.\n\nAlso to be noted, I in no way am saying that all NRIs or foreigners should be profiled in the way I describe some of them whom I know as because I say is very anecdotal and a personal experience, I could be wrong and it might be the case that a great many NRIs are really great and patriotic people who would die for India even though my experience mostly has been otherwise excluding a handcounted few people till date.\n\nAnd to end with, why exactly did I choose to stay back even when I had the chance to go?\nWell for one, I see America as an oversaturated society, there\'s too little competition and too many trophies to be won, and so little scope of growth on a collective since it\'s already a rich developed nation and will be pretty much prone to collapse due to years of bad policy in half a decade or so, also it\'s fucking costly to the point of being economically predatory at this point, and well...I also made it to a decent Indian medical college with my education being almost subsidized to the point of being free, and lastly, I would like to die serving my people, revolutionize Healthcare and improve the bureaucracy and systems in my own country rather than run away at the first sign of a problem,  an ailment is to be treated rather than throwing the patient away to the vultures and running from the virus, the problems in India require attention, not isolation and escapism, the very scope of improvement here makes a great case for a humongous growth potential in this country, compared to which most of the rich developed west looks like an old, slow, stagnant and not so happening society, well for one your only reason to leave here for elsewhere are freedoms to party and drink freely and roam around nude, am not exactly treating you like a mature adult who can make great calculated decisions so you can fuck right off, you\'ll anyway be fucked by your own decisions in the future.\n\nSo if not care about this, what exactly should we worry about? Well brain drain isn\'t exactly all red herring, therefore part of it that you do need to worry about, for one, think of why the people who completed their higher education from here itself are leaving after their undergrad or masters, that\'s the only people we need to worry about leaving, not the straight out of school teenagers!\n\nRant\'s over, don\'t try to start an argument if you don\'t agree, am short on time, ain\'t gonna reply back, so fuck right off!\n\nVande Mataram!'<br />Author: 'Nietzschanarsehole'  id: 's8kv1a'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s8kv1a/you_dont_need_to_worry_about_the_brain_drain_when/</li>

They are threatening us now.'<br />Body: " My brother recently took a small loan from an app called Forpay. It was legit, the verification and everything else was fine. When he wanted to repay, he opened the app and repaid it through the link in the app, to some UPI ID.\n\nA couple of days later, the guy calls him telling he has to pay the loan(He gives a link to the same app). My brother tells him he's done it, and he send a SS of the UPI transaction history and bank statement. The guy says that he never got it. Then he starts using strong language and threatening him that they have his address and they'll make a scene. He sounded Haryanvi and i might be wrong to say this, but sounded like a uneducated goon. On top of that the interest rate is extremely high, and they add that to the loan. It's connected to his PAN, so it's a problem.\n\nWhat can we do in this situation? I read something about the RBI Ombudsman but i'm not sure what exactly to do(How much time does it take? Any Guide/Source of Information?). What is the guarantee we pay him and he leaves us alone? Should we make some sought of video proof doing it? Will he actually show up?\n\nThe date to pay him is 21 Jan.

      <li>Title::: 'A message to all Indian Right Wingers'<br />Body: "I am an Indian Right Winger who has supported BJP in most of all matters and still do. But recent events in the context of lower politics during these UP elections has led me to a thought that can BJP be trusted in matters we right wingers support? My uncle has been a BJP Karyakarta for more tha 20 years and had a very clear chance to become Aligarh City BJP candidate for 2022 MLA elections. This evening, BJP announced Mukta Raja as the BJP candidate for this year. I have not heard this name in my whole life, but got to know that she is the wife of the sitting MLA Sanjeev Raja who is literally in Judicial Custody by the High Court of UP for allegations including murder. This woman has no popularity than being MLA's wife, who is being held by the court. Well, ofcourse you could think me as a selfish or something, but making criminals as MLA's is not quite good for our country. Previously, the BJP had done some not-so-good jobs, including no step against reservation, rather gave more reservation to the OBC. No step towards the re-estlishment of Hindus from Kairana or even the Kashmiri pandits. In 2017 we thought this man in Bhagva can do same things that previous Hindu leaders have not, and I am not talking about Development or economy in these things, but none has happened. Yeah, Ram Mandir was a very great step, but smaller temples and pilgrimages were severely neglected. Even matters like terrorism are seen to be treated a little leniently. The Taliban coup in Afghanistan was a very tragic step, and in my opinion, we didn't handle it quite good, and ig it will harm us in near future. Social Media is literally uncontrolled. It is now becoming more and more clear that BJP is not doing much, we right wingers want.

      <li>Title::: 'The Story of Kashmiri Hindus and the Ethnic Cleansing , 32nd Anniversary of Kashmiri Hindu exodus'<br />Body: '#20% of them left the valley due to 1950 land reforms of Sheikh Abdullah and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 % of the total. In 2016 only 3,445 pandits remained. The world slept when the massacre of the Pandits happened. \n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits (also known as Kashmiri Brahmins) are Kashmiri Hindus and a part of the larger Saraswat Brahmin community. They belong to the Pancha (five) Gauda Brahmana groups from the Kashmir Valley. **They lived in the Kashmir Valley before Muslim influence entered the region** after which large numbers converted to Islam. They are one of the only few remaining Kashmiri Hindu community native to Kashmir.\n\n---\n\n##1950 land reforms - LAND TO TILLER\n\nWhen the land to  tiller law of 1950 came into force, even the daughters of poor peasants  were treated as part of the estate on which the landlords enjoyed  absolute rights. The sweeping land reforms under the Big Landed  Estates Abolition Act passed on July 13, 1950, changed the complexion of  Kashmiri society.\n\n**The Kashmiri Pandits who were close to  tyrannical regime had not got any land outside the Kashmir valley.**\n\nIn  1950 when the constituent assembly of the Jammu Kashmir was  constituted, it had to decide four points including whether compensation  should be given to those landlords who have lost their land through the  land abolition act.\n\n**On November 5, 1951 the then Revenue Minister Mirza  Muhammad Afzal Beg refused to give compensation to landlords.**\n\n##Exodus from Kashmir (1985‚Äì1995)\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of  the valley during Dogra rule (1846‚Äì1947). 20 per cent of them left the  valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms and by 1981 the Pandit population amounted to 5 per cent of the total.\n\nIn the 1990s during the  eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical  Islamists and militants they were forced to flee in greater numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Events of 19 January 1990**\n\n&gt;On that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri  Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to  Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to  leave their women behind. The Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to  identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for  conversion or killing\n\nThe exact numbers vary between 600,000 to 800,000 Kashmiri Pandits fleeing Kashmir, some led a life of refugees in the camps of Jammu.\n\n---\n\n##Sheikh Abdullah referred Kashmiri Pandits as ‚Äúmukhbir\n\nIslamization of Kashmir began during 1980\'s when **Abdullah Government  changed the names of about 2500 villages from their native names to new  Islamic names.** The Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in  mosques similar to his speeches in 1930\'s. Additionally, he referred Kashmiri Pandits as ‚Äúmukhbir‚Äù or informers of the Indian government.\n\nSheikh\'s son Farooq Abdullah visited POJK and shared stage with JKLF leaders, though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of Indira Gandhi  and his father, so that sentiments there could "be known first hand",  few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed  Khalistan terrorist groups to train in Jammu province.\n\nIn February 1986, Gul Shah on his return to Kashmir valley retaliated and incited the Kashmiri Muslims by saying the famous dialogue , this led to the deaths of several Kashmiri Pandits and other Hindus.\n\n***Islam khatrey mein hey***\n\nThis is also the time when the movement ***Nizam-e-Mustafa*** started, Pandits were the first to be targeted and killed since they represented India, the movement gained big support and an Islamic State was on its verge of being established, during this time loot and rape was normal.\n\nOn June 23, 1989, pamphlets were  distributed in Srinagar. It was an  ultimatum to Muslim women, by an  organization that called itself  **Hazb-i-Islami**, to comply with ‚ÄòIslamic‚Äô standards within two days or  face ‚Äòaction‚Äô. ***Pandit women were asked to put a tilak on their foreheads  for identification.***\n\nOn Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, on October 14, 1989 a massive crowd gathered near the Budshah chowk in the heart of Srinagar, and from there, it marched towards Eidgah to the graveyard that had been renamed the ‚Äòmartyr‚Äôs graveyard‚Äô. The onlookers cheered and showered shireen on the marchers as if to welcome a marriage procession. The crowd was shouting slogans that had shocked most of the Kashmiri Hindus and a few Muslim Nationalists,\n\n\n    Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa\n    La sharqiya la garbiya, Islamia Islamia\n    Zalzala aaya hai kufr ke maidaan mein,\n    Lo mujahid aa gaye maidaan mein\n\n**English Translation:**\n\n    What will work here? The rule of Mustafa\n    No eastern, no western, only Islamic, only Islamic\n    An earthquake has occurred in the realm of the infidels,\n    The mujahids have come out to fight\n\n\n##Help for Pandits\n\nSome Hindus across India tried to help the Pandits. Bal Thackeray from Maharashtra got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these Pandits. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit.\n\n**You will hardly see any mention of the then GOI doing any major works for the Kashmiri Pandits.**\n\n---\n\n##Oregon Legislative Assembly Resolution\n\nIn 2009 Oregon Legislative Assembly  passed a resolution to recognise 14 September 2007, as Martyrs Day to  acknowledge ethnic cleansing and campaigns of terror inflicted on  non-Muslim minorities of Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists seeking to establish an Islamic state.\n\n##Numbers in 2010 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people\n\nIn 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir  noted that 808 Pandit families, comprising 3,445 people, were still  living in the Valley and that financial and other incentives put in  place to encourage others to return there had been unsuccessful. Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in 1990 only 2,000‚Äì3,000 remain there in 2016.\n\nWhat did the world do when this happened forget the world what did the GOI literally nil to nothing, the only one who stood and recongized that there was ethnic cleansing were the people of Oregon by passing a resolution in their Legislative Assembly .\n\nAnd today the world is crying saying there is no internet in Kashmir , people can\'t call their loved ones, people are not able to express their views. Did anyone call for a UNSC meet for the Kashmiri Pandits ? Did the Government of India do anything when the Islamist asked them to put a tilak ont heir heads so they could be identified easily ?\n\nMale Kashmiri Panits were asked to flee leaving behind their women and kids, the whole world including the Indian Govt slept when the ethnic cleansing of the Pandits took place.\n\nThis is exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews , but took close 2-3 decades for someone to do something and get justice to the Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nI hope the current govt of India also does something in spreading this information of how the Kashmiri Pandits were looted , raped and killed and thrown out of their own homes. To show the world what they suffered was nothing less than what the Jews were suffered!\n\n---\n\n##Militancy in 1990s\n\nThey began to leave in much greater numbers in the 1990s during the eruption of militancy, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants. The events of 19 January 1990 were particularly vicious.\n\nOn that day, mosques issued declarations that the Kashmiri Pandits were Kafirs and that the males had to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Those who chose to the first of these were told to leave their women behind.\n\nThe Kashmiri Muslims were instructed to identify Pandit homes so they could be systematically targeted for conversion or killing.\n\n\nAccording to a number of authors, approximately 100,000 of the total Kashmiri Pandit population of 140,000 left the valley during the 1990s. Other authors have suggested a higher figure for the exodus, ranging from the entire population of over 150,000, to 190,000 of a total Pandit population of 200,000, to a number as high as 800,000. The nature of the planned exodus has remain controversial, with the involvement of then Governor Jagmohan in organizing a clandestine exodus been a subject of controversy. Many of the refugee Kashmiri Pandits have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu. The government has reported on the terrorist threats to Pandits still living in the Kashmir region.\n\n---\n\n***Source:***\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit)\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri\\_Pandit#cite\\_note-exodus-28***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandit#cite_note-exodus-28)\n\n- [***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus\\_of\\_Kashmiri\\_Hindus***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus)\n\n- [***https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/***](https://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/more/news/from-sheikhs-land-to-tiller-to-azads-raj-tilak/)\n\n- [***https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953\\_5/37/the\\_kashmir\\_land\\_reforms.pdf***](https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1953_5/37/the_kashmir_land_reforms.pdf)\n\n- [***https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14\\_sept\\_1989\\_the\\_day\\_tika\\_lal\\_taploo\\_was\\_shot/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ftx2b/14_sept_1989_the_day_tika_lal_taploo_was_shot/)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 's7o7nb'<br />Score:133<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s7o7nb/the_story_of_kashmiri_hindus_and_the_ethnic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hinduism - the great weaknesses of Hindu Society that ultimately will lead to its demise'<br />Body: 'Hinduism has a lot of societal weaknesses-many of which will ultimately lead to its demise to the Christians and not the muslims as most expect( Arunachal Pradesh Christian population 30% in 3 decades , Kanyakumari \\~50% growing in 3 decades, Andhra Pradesh \\~25% ,Tamil Nadu \\~10%, Punjab \\~10%). \n\nSimilar weaknesses have destroyed cultures and local religions in countries varying from Africa(Christianity 5-10% in 1900 to being the largest religion in 2000) to South Korea(1% - being the largest religion in 30 years) and Hinduism will face a similar threat in the coming 2-3 decades.\n\n  \n1) **The lack of a proselytization culture**: One of the biggest weakness of Hinduism is its lack of proselytization - cultures such as Christianity and Islam have prospered largely on the back of high proselytization - Christianity especially with its call to convert to Christianity and immense organization of proselytizing along with its billions of dollars of funding has meant that large areas of the world are Christian. Further politicians from the Christian faith go all out to not only promote their faith.\n\n2) **A geographical concentration :** The geographic concentration of Hindus in India makes it less a world religion and more a regional religion. Thus linking the the fate and politics of the nation with the fate of the religion. Thus political changes in the country can affect and damage the entire religion\n\n3)**The lack of a dedicated state**: All the major world religions have a dedicated state - which atleast constitutionally seeks to protect the religion. The secularization of Nepal has meant that the Hindus today lack a single state which links its identity to Hindu religion and seeks to defend it.(Ironically the rapid spread of Christianity in Nepal(&gt;10% in a decade) may ultimately lead to it becoming a Christian nation) \n\n4) **The lack of unity, awareness and cultural pride**: One of the greatest weaknesses of Hinduism is the lack of pride and ownership among its members. While western countries and even in Christian states such as Nagaland people relate their religion- Christianity to their Civilization/Individual identity - thus the narrative of Christian Civilization, Islamic civilization the lack of a similar narrative(*partly to be blamed on the secular rule of India which saw India delink the current republic from its civilizational history*) has meant that the threat to the Civilization is not something that is seen. \n\nFurther the inability to see patterns and failure to learn from History has meant that Hindus time and again make the same mistake their ancestors and other countries made hundred of years ago, eg. making the same mistakes in Kashmir, Karachi and not acknowledging that demographic changes can alter their country.\n\nThus other countries have reacted much faster to the changing demographics then India has for eg in france as the muslim population reach 6-7% the rise of highly right wing leaders(La Pen,Zemmour) (with policies propogated such as no-immigration,banning of burkhas, children named using french names)started. Further today most( 60%+) believe the country is being destroyed by Islamic immigrants, similar to other countries such as Sweden.\n\n5)**Lack of Diversity in the Hindu right**: One of the greatest weaknesses of the Hindu religion is that there is a single Hindu right. Thus Hindus in India become overly dependant on RSS, BJP and their affiliated organizations. Further the failure of leadership and change in thought process in the organization can derail the Hindu movement(as can be seen from Modi who has failed to work for the long-term goals of the Hindu right)\n\n6) **The currently individual nature of the religion**: Today Hindu religion is highly individualistic in nature. While community does come together in festivals - the lack of regular meetups(such as in Islam and Christianity) has meant that the sense of community is not as strong. Thus values and political strength is much lesser and values and religion are not strongly passed on. So many individuals are today confused by what Hinduism is and find it easy to be swayed by vulture religions. Further the lack of a clear narrative of what Hinduism means due to large no of books and narratives means that people who are interested and want to know dont know what is the religion.\n\n7) **Divisions in Hindu society and lack of a unifying narrative:** The divisions and injustices in the Hindu society further make it easier for vultures to dive in and exploit it to gain market share. Further the lack of Hindu leaders in creating a unifying narrative has meant that Hindu society is today splintered with enough internal divisions so as to not stand on its own.'<br />Author: 'ramesh-suresh'  id: 's7igw5'<br />Score:115<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s7igw5/hinduism_the_great_weaknesses_of_hindu_society/</li>

Cutting the Gordian knot'<br />Body: '*‚ÄúIt is a natural tendency to view the world as governed by large things controlling small ones: large kingdoms dominating small ones, major cities ruling over satellite forts, men atop elephants and chariots directing regular cavalry and infantry. Yet machines may be designed so that a light touch to a thin string causes an entire palace to collapse.‚Äù*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/18/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**‚Äî2.5. Cutting the Gordian knot‚Äî**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and forty six years ago.*\n\n*(475 BC)*\n\n*‚ÄúAnd then what did you do, Father-sir?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúLuring them into a false sense of security by feigning defeat, I sent a group of prostitutes to distract Kulvalaka and the other Licchavis and break the chain of command, allowing my agents to seize the city before their confused eyes.‚Äù* \n\n*‚ÄúBrilliant, Father-sir!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúThat is NOT what you should be saying, Udayin. What should you be saying?‚Äù*\n\n*Udayin considered the question for a half-second. ‚ÄúThe prostitutes achieved what your catapults couldn‚Äôt. Thus, they are a threat to your supremacy.‚Äù The crown prince gulped. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to them, Father-sir?‚Äù*\n\n*Ajatashatru scrunched up his face as if confused by the question. ‚ÄúWhy, I simply beheaded them, of course. It would be quite silly to employ a more torturous method ‚Äì like cutting them into small shreds starting from the fingertips, or pouring molten metal down their throat, or chaining their limbs to those of elephants and having them slowly be torn apart, or placing them between spiked plates as they are pressed together by boulders dropped by cranes. Those are the methods to be employed against my enemies or against ordinary subjects for fun, not against those who have served me ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt want my subjects afraid of serving me, after all.‚Äù*\n\n*One could sense some nervousness in Udayin‚Äôs laugh, and this annoyed the Emperor to no end, but he decided against beating his son this time. This time, he would use Udayin‚Äôs favourite sex slave before his eyes ‚Äì yes, that would be an appropriate punishment.* \n\n*When the silence was finally broken, it was by Queen-Mother Chellana.* \n\n*Ajatashatru, upon being coronated, had shown mercy upon his own mother ‚Äì while he had imprisoned his father and had been subjecting him to regular torture for the past seventeen years, the former queens had been shown much kindness: he generously employed his brothers‚Äô mothers as prostitutes for the most distinguished commanders and champions in his armies, while his own mother, for her kind act of birthing him, was allowed to roam the palace freely and continued to enjoy her former chamber (of course, she had also been caned severely during the purge as a warning against making too many annoying moralizing chastisements against the king).*\n\n*‚ÄúThere is a request I wish to make, son,‚Äù she said weakly. Ajatashatru noticed that she had been crying ‚Äì probably something to do with how he had just mercilessly massacred her old relations in Vaishali. Oh, but Ajatashatru, you‚Äôre my son, you shouldn‚Äôt murder my cousins! You shouldn‚Äôt raze my city to the ground and go around suffocating its scholars and ministers by chaining them to the bottom of a pit and slowly pouring wet sand over them! Typical woman.*\n\n*‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù the king said with a sigh. He was quite kind that way.*\n\n*‚ÄúI have asked this of you, before, son ‚Ä¶ but I hope that you will grant me my boon this time ‚Ä¶ at least seeing your mother in this distraught state ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúThis again? OH, I WANT TO SEE MY HUSBAND AGAIN, I‚ÄôM LONELY, AND ALL MY SON TALKS ABOUT IS MURDERING PROSTITUTES AND MONKS. If you so desperately wish for a man‚Äôs company, Mother, then Dirghalochana is exhibiting his endowments quite publicly.‚Äù*\n\n*Queen-Mother Chellana sobbed.* \n\n*Ajatashatru ignored her.*\n\n*‚ÄúSon ‚Ä¶ if you ever felt that your father and I did not treat you well when you were young, that we did not respect your talents as we should have ‚Ä¶ then it is not your father you should blame ‚Ä¶ it is me.‚Äù*\n\n*Ajatashatru rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThe typical self-sacrifice. Ah, yes, it was my mother who preferred the sons of her husband‚Äôs other wives ‚Äì if that is so, Mother, then I must say I have even less respect for you now than before‚Äî‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúI threw you into the garbage dump when you were born, son!‚Äù Queen Chellana was sobbing.* \n\n*‚ÄúWhen you were conceived, I had these horrid dreams ‚Äì of consuming my husband‚Äôs heart ‚Äì I never dreamed of doing any harm, of course, just ‚Ä¶ I went to a seer and asked him what these dreams meant, and he told me it meant my son would have the heart of a monster, cold, wicked and devoid of any compassion. That he would feel neither remorse nor disgust at even cannibalism, and that there was no method of nurture that would change this, it was predetermined ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù*\n\n*Ajatashatru‚Äôs expression was blank.*\n\n*‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt bring myself to abort you. I just couldn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ you were my son. To do such a thing would be a betrayal of your father‚Äôs love for me, and an insult to mine for him. And yet when you were born, when I saw the eyes of the monster you were prophesied to become, the monster I had brought into this world ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù*\n\n*A weaker man would have accused: It is YOUR fault that I grew up to be a monster, Mother! What else would you expect from a child who was treated by his own mother as a freak of prophecy? The prophecy was self-fulfilling ‚Äì the only reason it was made because the monk knew what sort of a depraved woman you were, and predicted the outcome of your upbringing.* \n\n*But not Ajatashatru. For it was irrelevant what factors had influenced him to become the way he was ‚Äì for all it mattered, a butterfly could have flapped its wings and altered the course of history to cause him to be born, but he had no cause to honour that butterfly. Whatever he was, it was the product of his own decisions, and those decisions were the product of what his personality had been before. Further causation was irrelevant.*\n\n*And he was proud of what he was.*\n\n*‚ÄúYour father heard of what I had done, and dived into the garbage dump himself to find his beloved child, for that is what you‚Äôve always been to him, whether or not he showered you with the requisite affection. When he found you, you were wounded and sickly, having been picked and bitten by various filthy animals, covered with ashes ‚Ä¶ and you had a boil on your finger. Your father is, as you say, a barbarian ‚Äì he did not know how to treat the boil, or to bring you to a medical practitioner. So he took your finger in his mouth and sucked the pus out of it himself, caring not even for his own life, caring only for the slightest chance that his son survives.‚Äù*\n\n*The king‚Äôs eyes were red.*\n\n*‚ÄúThat is the truth of your father, son.

I ‚Ä¶ I will go and free him immediately.‚Äù*\n\n*Queen Chellana‚Äôs eyes widened in horror, but Ajatashatru was gone before she could protest.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Hence \\[the prince\\] shall be taught only of righteousness and of wealth, but not of unrighteousness and of non-wealth.

He had been so confident that he would effortlessly beat Chanakya in his own game, one way or another, that he had made no precautions against whatever plots Chanakya himself may have been making against him.\n\nHe should have corrected this belief when the boy had broke out of the most secure prisons, designed by Emperor Ajatashatru himself, by manipulating his prison guards.\n\nHe should have corrected this belief upon witnessing the degree of admiration and worship that the Gandharas possessed for the Brahmin boy. \n\nHe should have corrected this belief when he heard Chanakya‚Äôs lecture on the ways of manipulation, and his extensive descriptions of such techniques in various contexts in his other lectures; when he had displayed his knowledge of precisely those postures of manipulation that Pabbata had been trying against Chanakya. \n\nBut he had told himself, repeatedly, that Chanakya‚Äôs knowledge was only theoretical, that he would be utterly ineffectual in implementing it without Pabbata‚Äôs support. But upon observing Chanakya‚Äôs odd request unfold into a beautifully-executed heist that liberated the entirety of Punjab and Sindh from Persian rule while also ensuring ‚Äì at least for the time being ‚Äì their freedom from Magadha, Pabbata had to reconsider all that he had believed about his Professor.\n\nNow in the cosy confines of Chanakya‚Äôs residence, as Pabbata played Rajamandala huddled around a fire with the rest of the gurukula, he felt more dread than fondness or nostalgia. \n\n‚ÄúI believe you are the spy, Professor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI must execute you.‚Äù\n\nChanakya sighed. ‚ÄúEmperor ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù he said softly, ‚ÄúWhy do you distrust me so?‚Äù\n\nThe said Professor was eighteen this year. They had last seen each other five years ago, and had been apart for a rather formative period ‚Äì even if Pabbata had ever been right in his assessment of Chanakya, the boy had quite likely lost any such innocence that had been true of him in the past. \n\n(Pabbata found himself assassinated by Apratimaujas upon the next waking as a result of his unfounded suspicion of Chanakya.)\n\nBut most dreadful of all were Pabbata‚Äôs newfound worries about Chandragupta‚Äôs loyalties.\n\nSweet, loyal, upright Chandragupta.\n\nFive years ago, Pabbata would never have suspected a blemish in his sidekick‚Äôs character ‚Äì nor would he have distrusted Chandragupta to ever *change* when not under his influence. But whether as a consequence of Chandragupta‚Äôs loss of innocence, or Pabbata‚Äôs own ‚Äì Pabbata found himself fearing that even Chandragupta may have been turned by Chanakya, that his blind trust in Chandragupta was irrationally wishful, that naked, Pabbata truly had no allies. \n\nChandragupta collected the seals and props and placed them in a bag, while Shribhanu collected the fuel to prepare for bedtime. \n\nChanakya stood up, and Pabbata noticed that the Professor‚Äôs relaxed expression had given away to a far more serious one.\n\n‚ÄúPabbata and Chandragupta, there is something that we must talk about. The rest of you will go to sleep.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*A spy may tell the nymphomaniac chief of a mercenary corporation: ‚ÄúIn this village, the family of a poor man is widowed; his wife deserves to be the wife of a king; seize her.‚Äù* \n\n*Half a month after she has been seized, an ascetic spy may accuse the chief in the midst of the mercenary corporation by saying: ‚ÄúThis man has abducted my chief‚Äôs wife/sister-in-law/sister/daughter.‚Äù If the corporation punishes the chief, the conqueror may take the side of the corporation and set it against the wicked.* \n\n*Fiery spies should always cause an ascetic spy to go abroad at night.* \n\n*Spies, selected suitably, should accuse (the chiefs) by saying: ‚ÄúThis man has killed a Brahmin and violated the chastity of a Brahmin woman.‚Äù*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 11.1:48\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and forty six years ago.*\n\n*(475 BC)*\n\n*‚ÄúFather-sir,‚Äù Ajatashatru addressed politely, ‚ÄúI have come to make amends.‚Äù*\n\n*The former king Bimbisara looked up weakly from where he was sprawled, his body skeletal and his skin covered with filthy bruises.

His poor, poor father had seen his son approaching to free him, and thought: he is surely visiting to kill me! and committed suicide to spare his son of the sin of patricide.* \n\n*Second (and this was said between Queen Chellana‚Äôs hysterical sobs), Queen Vajirakumari Chellana would be granted her wish of being reunited with her husband.*\n\n*Third (and this was said as Queen Chellana‚Äôs bloodied body was carried out of the room by servants), Udayin ‚Äì who had so far been known to be a very poor shot as an archer ‚Äì was now skilled enough to practice archery on ornaments placed on the heads of live people, and Dirghalochana had been chosen for this honour.* \n\n*Fourth (and this was said as Dirghalochana‚Äôs flailing self was dragged out of the room), adding to the tragedies ‚Äì and this was known to no one else yet ‚Äì Chief Queen Vapushmati had succumbed to mysterious injuries and died in her cell. Yet another accident in the royal harem.*\n\n*Fifth (and this was said to an increasedly worried audience in an atmosphere that had considerably darkened), as a result of all these tragedies, the Rajagriha palace now appeared to be ridden with only sorrow for him, and the capital was to be shifted to the nearby town of Pataliputra; preparations would be underway immediately.*\n\n*‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said Ajatashatru, his ears perking up like he had just remembered something, ‚ÄúRight ‚Äì the fourth thing hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Ha, it is as if I just spoiled the ending of a play for you! I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Pamper a son until he is five years of age, and use the stick for another ten years, but when he has attained his sixteenth year treat him as a friend.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe two students set cross-legged apart from their Professor, who held them with a stern gaze.\n\nPabbata was nervous. Chandragupta appeared relatively calm.\n\n‚ÄúOne who does not know his goals cannot win,‚Äù said Chanakya. ‚ÄúAnd yet in all our deliberations so far, Pabbata, we have acted coy about our this, about what benefits we seek from each other. There are many reasons we have adopted this posture, without speaking of our goals explicitly, but now you are old enough, as is Chandragupta, and possess sufficient wit that there is no longer any advantage to be held in keeping this from you.‚Äù\n\nPabbata held his breath.\n\n‚ÄúI am testing you both as prospective future kings of Magadha,‚Äù Chanakya announced, making his worst fears come true, ‚ÄúOn the basis of that qualities that you possess, as they are true and as they are perceived by the elements of Magadha‚Äôs sovereignty. I have not made my decision yet, for it is a difficult one, and I might not make it for a very long time.‚Äù\n\nThis time it was Chandragupta who cast a nervous glance in Pabbata‚Äôs direction, as if he wished to say that he had no idea about any of these plans of the Professor; Pabbata held Chanakya‚Äôs gaze.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are these qualities, Professor?‚Äù he asked steadily.\n\nBut Chanakya ignored him. ‚ÄúI will say this much, however ‚Äì if either of you ends up dead, then the entire project will be discarded, and I will start afresh with a new crop of candidates. And if *I* end up dead ‚Ä¶ well, let us say the world will have to wait for another candidate for *my* place in all this. So it is in your best interests to ensure that neither of you comes to any harm.‚Äù \n\nPabbata did not quite believe that Chanakya would simply discard all the efforts he had invested into Pabbata ‚Äì who else could he even find? ‚Äì but did know that Chanakya could be rather unpredictable in many ways, and might justify such an act with an argument like ‚ÄúAs one should not cry over spilt milk, it is not the sunk cost that is worth considering while deciding to discard a project, but the future benefit and loss; the same applies to identifying when one has to surrender, for the fact that one is making great losses of men and wealth is an indicator of future defeat, and not an argument to make further losses‚Äù, or ‚ÄúThere is logical cause to have oneself be known as a man who adheres to his word, so that one can effectively use the means of *dama* and *danda* to influence behavior, and for this purpose one should abide by oaths even when it seems irrational, and it is for this purpose that scholarly institutions, noble lines and mercantile guilds and families bother so much about their reputation‚Äù ‚Äì so Pabbata did not wish to take the risk of angering his Professor. After all, if it came to be that Chanakya preferred Chandragupta to him, Pabbata could always have his rival killed *after*.\n\nIt was much easier, he realized, to make *Chandragupta* look bad.\n\nAnd so Pabbata came up with a diabolical plan of his *own*. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*On another occasion, Chanakya wished to test the youths, so while Chandragupta was sleeping, he ordered Pabbata to remove his woolen thread without breaking it or waking the owner, which Pabbata was unable to do. When Chandragupta was set the problem, however, he solved it after the manner of Alexander and the Gordian knot: he cut off Pabbata‚Äôs head, and Chanakya was not the man to be displeased at this.*\n\n‚Äîa tale from the Mahavamsa, not canon in this story, as told by Thomas Trautmann (1971), Kau·π≠ilya and the Arthashastra: a statistical investigation of the authorship and evolution of the text, p 14.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and forty six years ago.*\n\n*(475 BC)*\n\n*‚ÄúMy Hero,‚Äù Vapushmati said teasingly, ‚ÄúAll those years ago, in Anga, I had a palace of my own, built by my father. If you are truly the most powerful king in the world, and I your queen, then why, in all these years, have I seen nothing but the inside of a dungeon smelling of horse faeces?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúMore pretences that I am expected to uphold! Some kings build a palace the size of a city for their queens, I‚Äôll keep mine in a cage with rats and flies. Say another thing that annoys me and I will have to dispose of you.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúReally, you‚Äôll dispose of me, my Lord?‚Äù Vapushmati batted her eyelashes seductively.*\n\n*‚ÄúYou are beginning to annoy me once more, my Queen.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúWill you truly have the heart to let go of a beauty such as mine?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúThat beauty is fading already, and will last barely four or five more years. Your annoying nature will persist for much longer, if I do nothing about it.‚Äù*\n\n*Vapushmati laughed at first, then seemed to turn a little uncomfortable as Ajatashatru stayed silent.*\n\n*‚Äú ‚Ä¶ you jest ‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù*\n\n*It was when Ajatashatru unsheathed his dagger that her discomfort turned into fear, to desperation, and finally to dread.*\n\n*‚ÄúMy Lord ‚Ä¶ my Ruler ‚Ä¶ you know the love that I have for you, how much respect I hold for you in my mind, and in reality ‚Ä¶ I beseech you, you are the hero who saved me, who won me ‚Ä¶ I beseech you, my Lord‚Äî‚Äù*\n\n*Stab.* \n\n*‚ÄúAnd how am I to know that this is any different from my father‚Äôs supposed affection for me when he needed something out of me?‚Äù The Emperor‚Äôs voice was not cruel, merely cold and emotionless, and that only made it all much worse.*\n\n*‚ÄúI beseech you, my Lord ‚Ä¶ there is no one in these three worlds who knows you, who understands you like I do ‚Ä¶ and while even the gods worship you, they do not do so with the same devotion that I have toward you. It is not death that I fear, it is the betrayal ‚Äì you know me ‚Äì your company is all I have ever desired in life ‚Ä¶ I beg you, do not take that away from me.‚Äù*\n\n*But all her pleas fell on deaf ears. Ajatashatru sucked the life force of his beloved queen from the gash that he had made on her neck, and the lifeless body of the only person who had ever been an anchor to his insanity fell limply to the ground, covered in dead tears.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*He who runs away from a fearful calamity, a foreign invasion, a terrible famine, and the companionship of wicked men is safe.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHalf a fortnight later, Pabbata was found missing.\n\nThe university watched as Chandragupta appeared before a solemn Chanakya, fell to his knees, hands folded, and begged for mercy.\n\nChanakya simply shook his head, and told his student that he was forever expelled from the university.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*When the people of the enemy are suffering from famine and the oppression of thieves and wild tribes, the conqueror\'s spies should sow the seeds of dissension among them, saying: "Let us request the king for favour and go elsewhere if not favoured."*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.1:20\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis message is relayed from Pabbata, who addresses you thus:\n\nO Father, I must ask another boon of you. I assure you that this is part of my own game against the enemies of Magadha, and that you will see the fruits of this game in due time.\n\nI am not so na√Øve as to instantly believe Chanakya‚Äôs dismissal of Chandragupta, that I will accept this as proof of his fair-handedness in the contest, or that losing both his supposed candidates he will truly start anew or abandon his cause. I believe it is possible that this is a plot by him to lure me into a false sense of comfort.\n\nI request that you send a batch of spies to capture Chanakya and Chandragupta and bring them to Magadha. For all the same reasons as before, it is essential that they be captured alive. \n\nFurthermore, I ask for permission to use the king‚Äôs seal once.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Proclamation of his omniscience is as follows: rejection of his chief officers when their secret domestic and other private affairs are known; revealing the names of traitors after receiving information from spies specially employed to find out such men; pointing out the impolitic aspect of any course of action suggested to him; and pretensions to the knowledge of foreign affairs by means of his power to read omens and signs invisible to others when information about foreign affairs is just received through a domestic pigeon which has brought a sealed letter.* \n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.1:2\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nChanakya received the pigeon on his rooftop and unfurled the cotton-paper letter received from his spy.\n\n‚ÄúWhat does it say?‚Äù asked Panini.\n\n‚ÄúExactly as I suspected,‚Äù said Chanakya. ‚ÄúPabbata considers this to be the best opportunity to present himself as an almost-martyred hero in Magadha. He intends to decide, based on the fruits of his actions, whether to gain power from the inside, by executing me, or from the outside, by having me pardoned and taking my support as I had offered it. That is why he wishes me alive, and why he asked the king for the imperial seal.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd so what do you plan? Will you go into hiding?‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\nChanakya descended the staircase and at the central shrine for Yajnavalkya, struck the temple bell, attracting the attention of those of the university, as well as of every other human soul in Gandhara, who stopped whatever they were doing to listen to Chanakya‚Äôs words.\n\n‚ÄúHear, hear! Professors and students of Taxila, I wish for this to be known to you: I believe Prince Pabbata to be alive‚Äî‚Äù\n\n*Gasps.*\n\n‚Äú‚Äîhowever, after Chandragupta‚Äôs betrayal of my explicit word, I also possess equal cynicism for Pabbata‚Äôs goals, and paranoia that he will simply betray me to the Magadhan emperor. Thus, I am forced to go into hiding myself, and must promise to see you all again.‚Äù \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Weapons and armour shall be entered into the armoury only after they are marked with the king\'s seal. Persons with weapons shall not be allowed to move anywhere unless they are permitted by a passport. When weapons are either lost or spoilt, the superintendent shall pay double their value; an account of the weapons that are destroyed shall be kept up. Boundary-guards shall take away the weapons and armour possessed by caravans unless the latter are provided with a passport to travel with weapons.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.3:37-41\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was with a small army that Pabbata returned to Taxila.\n\nFor even though Gandhara did not share a border with Magadha, it was afraid of directly engaging against a Magadhan force in fear of a retaliatory trade war or covert war. Thus, the king‚Äôs officials attempted to negotiate with Pabbata as the guards stormed the courtyards at the break of dawn, questioning the target‚Äôs associates on his whereabouts. \n\nIt was to the threat of torture that Panini revealed Chanakya to be taking shelter with the Ashvakayanas ‚Äì the tribe of Queen Kripa with whom Chanakya had earlier formed an alliance in his plot against the Persians. At this, Pabbata ordered his guards to stop the grilling.\n\n‚ÄúThis is very well, then, prince!‚Äù said a young soldier enthusiastically. ‚ÄúWe shall go to Kamboja, interrogate the Ashvakayanas, locate Chanakya in their country and capture him!‚Äù\n\nAt this, Pabbata revealed the King‚Äôs seal, and announced, with no room for contradiction, walking past his allies and the Gandharan royals who had come to negotiate, that he will go there himself, and apprehend Chanakya himself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Of troops which have lost their leader or which are not trained, those that have lost their leader may be taken to fight under the leadership of a different person but not the troops which are not trained.*\n\n*Removal of vices and troubles, recruitment (of new men), keeping away from places of an enemy\'s ambush, and harmony among the officers of the army, are the means of protecting the army from troubles.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 8.5:17-18\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs Pabbata thought, Chanakya had anticipated an attack and had set up an ambush for his safety. After demonstrating that he was alone and without any contravariances or conspiracy (and secretly fearing a possible plot by Chanakya that involved killing him for some reason), he was finally able to extract Chanakya from his hiding spot and have him extract the camouflaged archers and snake charmers from the woods.\n\n‚ÄúYou had a whole ambush planned out, as I expected,‚Äù said Pabbata, exuding respect, ‚ÄúYou had Panini warn you in advance about my approach, and if I were arriving with an army, you would have interpreted that as an attempt to capture you.‚Äù \n\nChanakya nodded thoughtfully. ‚ÄúOut of curiosity, why *didn‚Äôt* you do that? You could have marched to Magadha a hero, having apprehended a dangerous enemy of the state.‚Äù \n\nThe prince feigned an expression of hurt. ‚ÄúI am shocked that you would insinuate such a thing of me, Professor ‚Äì that you would expect such an ungrateful act of me.‚Äù\n\nChanakya raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDo you truly so value our friendship, or our relationship as Professor and student? ‚Ä¶ Out of curiosity, what happened, exactly, when you supposedly died?‚Äù \n\nThis question surprised Pabbata, who asked: ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you figured it out already, Professor?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have multiple hypotheses.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI faked my death myself, of course.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, that was the hypothesis I was almost certain of.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo you think less of me now, Professor?‚Äù\n\nIt was a half-minute later that Chanakya finally responded to this enquiry, and when he did so, his voice was soft.\n\n‚ÄúDo you know why I revealed my plans to you two so explicitly, Pabbata?‚Äù\n\nPabbata considered the question. ‚ÄúI assumed it was because you knew I was already suspicious of your intents.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen what use would it have done me to confirm those suspicions? No, Pabbata. It was a *test*. If I tell you precisely what I wanted from you ‚Äì and yet forbade you the most obvious means of achieving that goal, how are you to play? That is the nature of problems one encounters in the practical world ‚Äì for if there was an easy way to achieve your goal, there would be another who would have already done so. And yet you found a solution ‚Äì this requires *creativity*; this requires *ambition*.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAre you merely flattering me, Professor?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is no secret, prince, that I do not regard you as an *ideal* candidate for a king. However, you are better than any alternatives I know of. Chandragupta has many great qualities, but as he has demonstrated in his response to my test, he lacks *ambition*. He did not protest when I expelled him ‚Äì did not attempt to stage a coup against me, and did not attempt to locate you so as to expose your plot and earn back my favour.‚Äù \n\nPabbata‚Äôs chest swelled as he heard these words. He had often been troubled by that very question ‚Äì of what it was that made him and Chandragupta so different, despite the latter‚Äôs admitted goodness ‚Äì what it was that made Pabbata fit to be king, and Chandragupta fit to be only his minion. To hear the answer to this expressed in such rational terms added a certain genuineness to Chanakya‚Äôs words, and Pabbata believed him. \n\n‚ÄúBetween men who seek to be great, and men who seek to be good,‚Äù Chanakya continued, ‚ÄúThose who seek greatness often achieve a great deal more good than those who seek merely to do good, because the latter tend to underestimate their true capacities, lack the creativity to achieve great ambitions, and satiate their desires with small, token acts of goodwill. I say this not to flatter you, Pabbata, but to remind you to never lose that spirit of ambition. I do not regret sending Chandragupta away. But his intelligent and loyal, and I believe that he may serve you well ‚Äì I will continue to tempt him with the prospect of power and betrayal, and use him to secure loyalty to you among the kingdoms of Punjab and Sindh.‚Äù\n\nPabbata felt himself sigh, regretting, half in jest, the day that he met Chanakya and decided to court his support. They were back to this game ‚Äì of the art of double-crossing ‚Äì and Pabbata simply had to *trust* that in the end it will not be him who will be betrayed. Why couldn‚Äôt things ever be *simple* with this man? \n\n‚ÄúLoyalty to me, Professor?‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúIn what context, precisely?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúFor now, in your war for the throne of Pataliputra. And later, to you as the Emperor of all the land from the Mountains beyond eagles‚Äô reach \\[1\\] to the Eastern Ocean \\[2\\] ‚Äì of Aryavarta undivided!‚Äù \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*He went to Gautama Haridrumata and said to him: ‚ÄúI wish to become your student, Sir ‚Äì may I come to you, Sir?‚Äù He said to him: ‚ÄúOf what family are you, my friend?‚Äù*\n\n*He replied: ‚ÄúI do not know, Sir, of what family I am. I asked my mother, and she answered ‚Äì in my youth when I had to move about much as a servant, I conceived thee; I do not know of what family thou art; I am Jabala by name, thou art Satyakama \\[analogous, Philalethes\\]. I am therefore Satyakama Jabala, Sir.*\n\n*He said to him: ‚ÄúNo one but a true Brahmin would speak so honestly. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you \\[as a Brahmin\\].

I am writing to you, in secret, rather than to be read in the court of Ayodhya, for I seek to forge an alliance with you ‚Äì not with the king of Ayodhya, but with you directly.*\n\n*Ordinary alliances are made on the basis of mutual interest, but I make a far costlier request from you: I ask that we forge an alliance, not for the interests of our respective kingdoms, but for the interest of Vedic civilization at large. For the goal of protecting the Vedas and the Sanskrit language, the sciences, the culture of free thought and chaste behaviour ‚Äì from the barbarism that is Ajatashatru‚Äôs expanding empire.*\n\n*We cannot regard this as a mere conflict between kingdoms. As a conflict between ideas, I fear that this will be only the first of centuries of war.

And due to COVID, haven‚Äôt been able to take a vacation trip to India in last 4 years. \n\nI will soon be completing my education and midway my education I felt I should move back to India considering the immense amount of Brian Drain. \n\nI kinda feel if everyone will move out of India who will work to build the nation. \n\n(I am in not way trying to demean, or offend people who have moved out of India, or are planning to do so in the future. It‚Äôs just my opinion solely applicable to me. I completely understand everybody comes from different backgrounds, mindsets, goals and ambitions hence, have a different path to choose in life for themselves. Sooo please don‚Äôt get me wrong!) \n\nBut I‚Äôm not sure if I am thinking right! A lot of my friends currently based India really want to move out and, say it‚Äôs better to stay overseas than in India due to lack of good employment opportunities, non-conducive work environment, or lack of good standard of living in India atm.\n\nBut I kinda feel if I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled 100% while living in a country overseas as I miss my own country ‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point of good work culture here! It might be a struggle but I might end up finding a decent job in India too! (I hope so!)\n\nJust to give some more context, I am not super super ambitious in life. I like to live my life with utmost simplicity and happiness. That being said I would 200% want to work as I don‚Äôt want to be financially dependent on anyone. I want to be able to meet my needs, and wants on my own and also, end up doing some savings by myself for future. Hence, I am not too fixated on living in big cities or, working with big firms and stuff! I do y mind that either but if I don‚Äôt get it I won‚Äôt be tooo sad or, frustrated in life! \n\nTo sum it all up, I really feel I should come back to India and do something for the nation in whatever small capacity I can. But the more I consult people living in India I get amazed at how much India has changed and, am left with no final decision to make due to the sheer amount of confusion dispensed form their opinions.\n\nJust had these floating thoughts in my mind since last one week, hence dumped them down here! Any advice or, comment will be appreciated! \n\nCheers! üòä\n\nP.S. Please ignore any typos, typed the text super fast and haven‚Äôt bother enough to proof read it. \n\nAlso, based on some suggestion, I am re-posting this post of mine in this sub reddit.

Make an assessment of the material, capital      and human resources of the country, including technical personnel, and      investigate the possibilities of augmenting such of these resources as are      found to be deficient in relation to the nation‚Äôs requirement;\n2.

Indicate the factors which are tending to      retard economic development, and determine the conditions which, in view      of the current social and political situation, should be established for      the successful execution of the Plan;\n5. Determine the nature of the machinery which      will be necessary for securing the successful implementation of each stage      of the Plan in all its aspects;\n6. Appraise from time to time the progress      achieved in the execution of each stage of the Plan and recommend the      adjustments of policy and measures that such appraisal may show to be      necessary; and\n7. Make such interim or ancillary recommendations      as appear to it to be appropriate either for facilitating the discharge of      the duties assigned to it, or on a consideration of prevailing economic conditions,      current policies, measures and development programmes or on an examination      of such specific problems as may be referred to it for advice by Central      or State Governments.‚Äù\n\nOkay, stop right there.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at Niti Aayog:\n\n¬∑ ‚ÄúTo evolve a shared vision of national development priorities, sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States.\n\n¬∑ To foster cooperative federalism through structured support initiatives and mechanisms with the States on a continuous basis, recognizing that strong States make a strong nation.\n\n¬∑ To develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the village level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of government.\n\n¬∑ To ensure, on areas that are specifically referred to it, that the interests of national security are incorporated in economic strategy and policy.\n\n¬∑ To pay special attention to the sections of our society that may be at risk of not benefiting adequately from economic progress.\n\n¬∑ To design strategic and long-term policy and programme frameworks and initiatives, and monitor their progress and their efficacy. The lessons learnt through monitoring and feedback will be used for making innovative improvements, including necessary mid-course corrections.\n\n¬∑ To provide advice and encourage partnerships between key stakeholders and national and international like-minded think tanks, as well as educational and policy research institutions.\n\n¬∑ To create a knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurial support system through a collaborative community of national and international experts, practitioners and other partners.\n\n¬∑ To offer a platform for the resolution of inter-sectoral and inter\xad departmental issues in order to accelerate the implementation of the development agenda.\n\n¬∑ To maintain a state-of-the-art resource centre, be a repository of research on good governance and best practices in sustainable and equitable development as well as help their dissemination to stake-holders.\n\n¬∑ To actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of programmes and initiatives, including the identification of the needed resources so as to strengthen the probability of success and scope of delivery.\n\n¬∑ To focus on technology upgradation and capacity building for implementation of programmes and initiatives.\n\n¬∑ To undertake other activities as may be necessary in order to further the execution of the national development agenda, and the objectives mentioned above.‚Äù\n\nWoah. So many things? Okay they are inefficient. Tata good bye.\n\nOn a serious note, when Planning Commission used to produce five-year plan, that reminds me of the socialist and communist times. \n\nThe five-year plan was and is ineffective because situation is a dynamic thing which can change.\n\nLook at the COVID-19. So many governments had to step in to help their citizen. I read Narendra Modi biography and was appalled at many of the government policies during Congress governments.\n\nTherefore, after becoming the Prime Minister for the Republic of India, he dissolved and created Niti Aayog.\n\nMany of you have seen the UN Sustainable Goals. I will answer that in another post.\n\nMy previous posts had raised some legitimate questions of how is the Central Government monitoring its policies? ([https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rypxwk/simple\\_analysis\\_of\\_bharat\\_economy\\_and\\_policies/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rypxwk/simple_analysis_of_bharat_economy_and_policies/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))\n\nHere I am answering my own question: Niti Aayog.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good move by PM Modi. CAG audits the financials of the states and the centre. Niti Aayog sees the overall picture of the country.\n\nLet‚Äôs begin with the vision:\n\n**Centre Policies Effectiveness and Monitoring States**\n\nAs mentioned previously, India is a country with huge population. Moreover, the policies have to reach its citizen quickly and ensure citizens benefit from good policies.\n\nLet‚Äôs take the ‚ÄúTika Abhiyan‚Äù as an example. In order to ensure the eligible citizens get the vaccination, the state governments need to work with centre to ensure that citizens from urban to rural get the necessary vaccine. Of course, Niti Aayog will also need to step in to ensure the vaccination reaches the village level.\n\nAnother policy is the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. The policy is to create all weather roads in far flung villages. Niti Aayog also steps in to ensure the timely completion of the project.\n\nThe statistics show that there has been a tremendous progress of PMGSY.\n\n([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1201420/india-number-of-habitations-connected-by-pmgsy/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1201420/india-number-of-habitations-connected-by-pmgsy/))\n\n([http://omms.nic.in/](http://omms.nic.in/))\n\nIn the Annual Report of 2020-21, the annual report showed many examples of how the Niti Aayog interacts with the states to work on projects to improve the socioeconomic conditions of the state and even improve certain aspects of the state.\n\n**How Proactive is Niti Aayog is? Case in Point : Petroleum**\n\nOne of the examples that stood out for me was the development of strategic petroleum reserve facilities on public private partnership mode. Niti Aayog helped to create the transaction documents which clearly shows how proactive Niti Aayog is.\n\nAnother example is the Methanol Economy. \n\nWhy is this important project?\n\n‚ÄúDiesel and petrol prices are increasing‚Äù\n\nA safad kapada aadmi keeps asking and shouting ‚ÄúGST bad raha hai, blah blah‚Äù Give a solution? No.\n\nNiti Aayog is helping to create a hydrogen economy roadmap. \n\nExcerpts from the report.\n\n‚ÄúReview the status and explore complete feasibility of application, production, transportation, handling, use, safety aspects, etc., of hydrogen fuel, and suggest a clear roadmap. 2. Examine the utilization of hydrogen as a fuel through focused research on its development and deployment‚Äîproduction, transportation/storage and consumption. 3. Identify the roles of different stakeholders, their interest and capabilities, budgetary requirements, and timeline for various deliverables.‚Äù\n\nIn 1970s, prices had increased due to the oil price shocks. Brazil stood out by using the sugarcane to be used as an alternative fuel. Now all cars have been equipped with flex-fuel vehicles. ([https://www.rapidtransition.org/stories/the-rise-of-brazils-sugarcane-cars/](https://www.rapidtransition.org/stories/the-rise-of-brazils-sugarcane-cars/) ) Already Shri Nitin Gadkari had mentioned this during many conferences that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is working with Niti Aayog to develop such policies. ([https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-02/Annual-Report2020-2021-English\\_0.pdf](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-02/Annual-Report2020-2021-English_0.pdf)) \n\nTo do this, it is a tricky thing because we need to identify the sources to obtain the necessary ingredients. After that, we need to convert some of the factories to produce these alternative fuels. Thereafter, we need to think about how to equip gas stations with such alternative fuels and the logistics for transporting it. Moreover, India has a very big population of vehicles. It‚Äôs not possible to change EVERY single vehicle to this. \n\nTherefore, India needed such an organisation who can think neutrally and come up with innovative solutions. As a think tank, this is much better than the Planning Commission. Like I mentioned, situation is dynamic. Petrol and Diesel are both non-renewable and come from the many rich oil producing nations which can exhort huge profits."<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 's5t6iw'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s5t6iw/has_niti_aayog_been_a_good_move_by_pm_modi/</li>

After a vacation, this is the first thread of 2022! Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Philippines to procure missile defense system from India](https://www.firstpost.com/india/in-first-brahmos-missile-export-order-philippines-approves-374-million-contract-all-you-need-to-know-10287001.html)\n\nIn a major challenge to China in the South China Sea, the Philippines has placed an order worth $374 million to purchase BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as part of a missile defense system from India.  The missiles, produced by Indo-Russian JV BrahMos Aerospace Ltd., can be launched from any platform (land, air, or sea). The missiles are already widely deployed along the Indo-Tibetan boundary. Previous tests have shown that the missiles can break medium-sized warships into two at a speed of Mach 2.6. China often sends warships and coastguard boats to the South China Sea in contravention of international law. \n\n2. [Undersea volcanic eruption leads to tsunami warning](https://news.yahoo.com/tonga-issues-tsunami-warning-undersea-065830694.html)\n\nA tsunami warning was issued all along the Pacific rim as a strong undersea volcano erupted off the island nation of Tonga (population of about 1 lakh). The volcano was so spectacular that its lava and ash have created a small new island near Tonga itself. The eruption is also believed to have severed an undersea fiber optic cable connecting Tonga to Fiji, cutting off the island from the internet. Meanwhile, medium-sized tsunami waves were reported in the US island territories of Hawaii and America Samoa, with minor waves associated with the event reported as far as California. Whether the explosion is over or not remains to be seen, as subsequent eruptions are possible. \n\n3. [Djovokic provides off-court entertainment in Australia](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10405763/How-Novak-Djokovics-lawyers-hit-government-NEW-argument-stars-Federal-Court-fate-looms.html)\n\nSerbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, who holds controversial opinions on COVID-19 and has refused to get vaccinated, faces imminent deportation from Australia for a second time. The 33 year old defending champion received a vaccination exemption to participate in the Australian Open, in a country which has some of the tightest COVID rules in the world. In the face of protest, the Australian government denied him entry on arrival and put him in a refugee processing hotel pending appeal. He won the appeal and began practicing in Melbourne, only to have his visa revoked again. His lawyers have appealed the decision (again). Meanwhile, Serbia\'s President has lodged strong protests against the "harassment" of his country\'s sports hero, echoing anti-Serbian conspiracy theories that have widespread following in the country since it was bombed by NATO in the 1990s.\n\n4. [Ukrainian govt websites hacked, Russia suspected](https://apnews.com/article/technology-europe-ukraine-hacking-106e5948eb4e313c7eba53d714cb7533)\n\nIn the shadow of a massive Russian troop buildup along its eastern border, several websites of the Ukrainian government were hacked and defaced. Although the hack did not cause a serious disruption to everyday life, it is strongly suspected to be a warning shot from Russia. Ukraine is trying to join NATO, a move that Russia strongly opposes on grounds of national security as well as historical ties. The country has been hit with cyberattacks in the past, but pinpointing it to the Russian govt has proven to be impossible as many non-state actors are employed as intermediaries. Meanwhile, Russia claims to have arrested a group of hackers who are blamed for the hack of the Colonial Pipeline last year in the US, which caused billions of dollars in damage. \n\n5. [Kazakh crackdown leaves 225 people dead](https://thehill.com/policy/international/589905-unrest-in-kazakhstan-leaves-225-dead)\n\nA widespread revolt against Kazakhstan\'s dictatorial government this year was put down by a strong military crackdown that was assisted by Russian troops. Now, the Kazakh government revealed that the crackdown led to the deaths of 225 people, of whom only 19 were members of security forces and the rest were civilians. Kazakh President Tokayev, a close ally of Russian President Putin, had ordered forces to shoot and kill protesters. Over 50,000 people are said to have participated in the protests, with over 10,000 being arrested and facing charges.\n\n6. [Turkey and Armenia hold talks in Moscow](https://www.ktsm.com/news/international/turkish-armenian-envoys-meet-in-bid-to-end-chilly-relations/)\n\nSpecial representatives of Turkey and Armenia came together for talks brokered by Russia in Moscow, a historic move that aims to normalize relations between the two countries. The two do not have any diplomatic ties. Turkey backed Azerbaijan in an ultimately victorious war against Armenia in 2020, which further led to a chill in ties. Moreover, Turkey refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire: a century-old tragedy that still lingers over both sides. The present talks have the blessings of Azerbaijan as well, which is also seeking to end hostilities on its borders. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The 1973 Oil Shock\n\nSince the second half of last year, the world has been grappling with excessively high prices of crude oil that have made petroleum products more expensive. Things reached such a head that a group of oil consuming countries - including both China and the Quad countries - released oil from their strategic reserves to warn oil producers against creating an artificial shortage (the subsequent spread of the Omicron variant dampened prices in the end). This is not the first time that oil has become a bone of contention in the world of geopolitics: since the world\'s first commercial oil field was drilled in Titusville, Pennsylvania, USA, the world\'s economy has become extraordinarily dependent on this one commodity. \n\nNo wonder then that some countries decided to weaponize it. By the late 1960s, the US (which was till then the world\'s largest oil producer) was facing a decline in domestic production and had turned into a net importer of crude oil for the first time in its history. Suddenly, the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia specifically, became extremely geopolitically significant for NATO as a result. Saudi Arabia and six other oil exporting countries formed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as a means of coordinating the use of this newly-found power. However, they proved rather ineffective, often failing to created a coordinated policy on oil pricing, especially given that the US was withdrawing from the gold standard. \n\nThen in 1973, the Arab oil producers converged around a rallying point. On the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, a coalition of Arab countries led by Egypt and Syria invaded Israel from the occupied Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights respectively (Israel had occupied them during the previous Arab invasion in 1967). The war quickly became international, with the Soviet Union and its allies providing aid and supplies to the Arab side, and the US and its allies in Europe and Japan doing the same to Israel. The war was quick and decisive, with Israel comprehensively defeating the Arabs, in no small measure due to the generous aid provided by the US administration of Richard Nixon. Years later, Egypt and Israel reached a settlement wherein the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in exchange for diplomatic relations, while Israel officially annexed the Golan Heights from Syria in the final years of Benjamin Netanyahu\'s government. \n\nBut before the settlement came OPEC\'s revenge on the US and its allies for supporting Israel. On October 17, 1967, OPEC refused to sell oil to the US and its allies, while also cutting supplies steadily to a total reduction of 25% by December. International oil prices quadrupled in that period, going from just $3/bbl to $12/bbl between Sept, 1973 and March, 1974. All the major economies in the world (outside of the Soviet sphere) suffered an economic recession. Japan was hit particularly badly, with over 90% of its oil being imported from OPEC countries. The country had to institute rationing and industry shutdowns to conserve its stockpiles. In the US, the sudden spike in prices forced the Nixon administration to institute price controls on oil for the first time after World War II, with monthly quotas being established and speed limits being lowered across highways to reduce demand. In the UK, the economic pain led to widespread strikes and the eventual collapse of the Labour government. Even in India, which was largely cut off from the global economy, the combination of the economic ruin of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1973 oil shock led to deep economic pain and political instability in the country, ultimately setting the stage for the 1975 national emergency. \n\nAlmost as soon as the oil embargo was established, Nixon\'s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger went to work, so that within about 8 months, the embargo was lifted and oil production started to rise as well. But the shock of the embargo was such that it changed the world forever. In the US, a new pitch for domestic production grew, which ultimately reached its goal in the 2000s when US shale oil production took off, making the country once again the world\'s largest producer of crude oil. In Japan, support for nuclear power grew in order to compensate for the island country\'s hopeless dependency on Middle East oil, a movement that continued until the Fukushima disaster. Both Japan and the UK, and to a smaller extent the rest of Europe, started to decouple their Middle East policy from the US, insisting that Israel respect its own borders and stop annexing more territory from Arab neighbours. Arab countries realized the power of crude oil and began amassing massive fortunes by keeping supply perpetually lower than demand, albeit not as dramatically as during the oil shock. Saudi Arabia funneled much of that money to spread Wahhabism around the world, a policy that continued till the last decade with the rise of crown prince MbS and his push to de-radicalize society. In Iran, the power of oil was one of the factors that encouraged Khamenei to overthrow the Shah during the Islamic Revolution and then nationalize the Iranian oil industry, a system that continues to this date. Countries, including India, began to diversify their sources of oil, with new fields in the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, and Alaska becoming profitable. And finally, OPEC stopped coupling oil with geopolitics, choosing to use it purely as an economic tool instead, lest the world find an entirely new source of energy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have any questions about geopolitics?

You can find the previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/niqddo/a_look_at_the_state_of_the_indian_economy_using/). I wanted to have a look at the indicators before Omicron starts showing its impact on the economy starting January.\n\nIn this post, I have selected a total of 40+ such indicators that represent the majority of the Indian economy. These indicators have been divided into 8 sectors:\n\n1. Macroeconomic indicators\n2. Industrials\n3. Trade\n4. Logistics\n5. Financials\n6. Sector-specific\n7. Sentiments\n8. Investment scenario\n\n# Macroeconomic Indicators\n\nThe second wave of COVID-19 led to a dip in central govt finances as well as monthly GST collections. For GST though, we have comfortably surpassed 2019 levels, which is a good sign.\n\nInflation has absolutely shot up in 2021, especially the WPI. Unsurprisingly, this is largely due to massive price hikes in fuel and power segment, which accounts for a significant portion of the index.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uksvb5ul5vb81.png?width=1333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=695de7b6577555b706048268ade730a0c192ff25\n\nOrganised sector hiring dipped during COVID second wave (April‚ÄìJuly 2021). Work demand also increased amid COVID, but has gradually flattened below 2020-21 average.\n\nIn terms of EPF, Maharashtra is the largest contributor, and adds almost double the number of subscribers every month, compared with second-placed Gujarat/Karnataka/Tamil Nadu.\n\nFrom the Naukri Index, Telecom and hospitality sectors were the fastest growing, registering a 91% and 50% Y-o-Y growth in Nov 2021. Ahmedabad witnessed the fastest growth in 2021, followed by Bengaluru.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/an0lufpm8ub81.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9158222e3b1e65c908595c396c9a92044a6e1e2\n\nKey RBI rates have remained unchanged throughout 2021. Forex reserves are significantly higher than 2019 levels, despite dropping in Q1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2m97upp8ub81.png?width=1334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484e0a49d09811fc5d9e9ffff7a9244e783f70dc\n\n# Industrial\n\nAverage power consumption witnessed some decline during COVID second wave, but recovered quickly. The declining consumption towards winter months is a usual phenomenon\n\nAlthough the IIP has surpassed pre-COVID levels, consumption of petroleum products remains below 2019 levels\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6298r2wr8ub81.png?width=1325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b1913a527fcce500db28457e036f8e04aadf8a4\n\n# Trade\n\nMerchandise trade has been consistently above average 2019 levels. Although exports were down in November (increasing the deficit), they picked up in December (not included in graph yet).\n\nA key thing to notice here is that even during the COVID second wave, exports DID NOT decrease, while imports did. This is because consumption decreased as restrictions were imposed, however the govts were smart enough not to completely shut down supply.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw5nbd6b9ub81.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7055a0f4fbf0c0a3205dd634d495b3aef07c1b45\n\nService trade is a strong point for India. We seem to have surpassed 2019 levels. The COVID second wave had some impact, although nothing drastic\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bq02cc16bub81.png?width=1313&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a277c71b75332532e87924758a3698117ff89d\n\n# Logistics\n\nBoth FASTag transactions and e-way bills generation witnessed significant dip (\\~30% in May 2021) as transportation was disrupted by COVID. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0j2aprfcub81.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a6aaf0070926e2f93b9d19a91df5e3bf3e7747\n\nAir freight still remains below 2019 levels. This is mainly due to the fact that a lot of freight capacity goes into passenger flights, in the form of 'belly capacity', and since the airline sector has continuously been on some kind of restrictions since March 2020, freight could never pick up.\n\nIn terms of rail freight, we have comfortably surpassed 2019 levels. This is an important development, as railway is the cheapest means of transit in the country. In the past, bad punctuality and reliability in the railways led traders to choose air/road route, despite these being more expensive. The dedicated freight corridors are expected to provide a massive boost to rail freight.\n\nCurrently, rail only accounts for \\~18% of total goods transported. road accounts for \\~71%, despite being expensive, riskier and more pollutive, compared with railways. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5t44wvvcub81.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9b152b9cda61e1aa23c2e5707b92f0788d3c398\n\nPassenger commute witnessed drastic fall during the second COVID wave. However, it has recovered considerably.\n\nUnsurprisingly, both air and rail passengers remain below 2019 levels, due to continuous restrictions on travel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97xd7rmijub81.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b8ad0230229f464794d51b09bf579476498c6a\n\nCargo handled by ports has declined in second half of the year. While cargo handled by major ports remain above 2019 levels, the same has slipped below 2019 levels in case of non-major ports.\n\nThere is a serious need to upgrade port infra in India. Only 2 of India's ports feature in the top 50 global ports - Jawahar Nehru port (35 rank in 2019) and Mundra port (39 rank in 2019). This is despite India being a huge consumer market. The rankings haven't improved in the past 3-4 years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n77xioexjub81.png?width=1317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a02982ae2234bb40f92794bb514d405ce59b9a\n\n# Financials\n\nBank deposits and credit both have comfortably surpassed 2019 levels, indicating increased banking activity. IMPS transactions have steadily increased in 2021.\n\nHowever, UPI has been the star of the show. The number of UPI transactions have double through the year. Thanks to Jio for single-handedly revolutionising internet in India, which has made this possible. And ofcourse the govt push towards digital payments\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luogxopplub81.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d843c8a801a363e62fcfed0f3bc31ef3c070c940\n\n# Sector-specific\n\nNatural gas production increased \\~18% during Jan-Oct 2021 and remains well above 2019 levels. However, steel consumption and cement production has dropped during the year, which is not a very good sign, as these are critical elements in building infrastructure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9mx4woemub81.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c70a750f3f87e1fc46d3f96cabc87baf04cd1760\n\nVehicle sales were significantly impact by the COVID second wave. In May 2021, sales dropped anywhere between 50-75% month-on-month. \n\nOnly tractor sales have recovered fully from the pandemic and increased above 2019 levels. Rest of the categories continue to remain below 2019 levels. The slow recovery is also due to supply issues such as the persistent shortage of semiconductors, leading to slower production\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hh4q6qrnub81.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5504fbd4a06b8cd532f37ae8a068c45c3ba768af\n\nPharma sales skyrocketed during the COVID second wave. Although they came down, they have remained significantly above 2019 levels. Fertiliser sales also show a similar trend and remain well above pre-COVID levels\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwmge6cloub81.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee1f71d7594f6ba1540c217725724916090fd8b\n\nLife and non-life insurance both remain close to 2019 levels. India's insurance penetration remains at low levels. In 2021, the govt passed bill that allows for up to 74% FDI in insurance, up from the previous figure of 49%. This will hopefully aid the sector in increasing penetration in India\n\nIn terms of life insurance, LIC dominates the market with a share of approx. 61%, followed by SBI Life with a share of approx. 9%. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn3h2m8woub81.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea300b36ab83dbafb4c1ff85da1234562d4fc413\n\n# Sentiments\n\nManufacturing and services PMI fell below 50 (indicating possible contraction in the sector) during the second COVID wave. However, they recovered strongly since. RBI consumer confidence shows that people were more optimistic about the future after the first wave, than after second wave. I think we can all relate to that feeling.\n\nThese are pre-Omicron estimates, and therefore both the PMIs and the consumer confidence will likely decline in Q1 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o79o1u8yqub81.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b01875867629bd5b37a4c7204731deca5e7d572\n\nStock market transaction remain well above 2019 levels, despite declining considerably in Q4 2021. Investment in mutual funds increased around 23% during the year.\n\nSo far, a disproportionately large chunk of money in the Indian stock market comes from foreign investors and India institutional investors (large investors). Retail investors represent a very small portion. According to a recent report, Indian households invest just 7% of their financial assets in equities, compared with 40% in Latin America and 50% in the US.\n\nThis is rapidly changing with younger population increasingly investing in the stock market either directly or through mutual funds. This is mostly due to smart marketing by companies such as Paytm and Zerodha, higher risk appetite among youngsters and better financial literacy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwqxragprub81.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea36f643512d63389386957ae504e0d1354a229f\n\n# Investment scenario\n\nFDI inflow totalled at $33.7 billion during April-October 2021, marginally lower than previous year. Investment by FIIs remain almost 70% lower year-on-year during April-Oct 2021. \n\nTechnology, E-commerce and media and entertainment sectors garnered the maximum investment from PE/VC investors in 2021. \n\n*Processing img cn860trvtub81...*\n\nCount of tenders remains significantly above 2019 levels. This is indicative of increased capex by the govts. Value of count also remains above 2019 levels.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aq7xtp512vb81.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8939e0065f0a78c6203b5d14827f3ec009aaea7d\n\nTo conclude, we saw significant impact of the drastic second COVID wave during April-July. Most of the indicators were down during the period. However, they bounced back quickly towards the end of the year. \n\nThe good news is that most of the indicators have comfortably surpassed 2019 levels, except certain indicators such as air travel and freight movements. The travel and hospitality industry remains the worse-hit sector by the pandemic and unfortunately, the govt hasn't done much to help them stay afloat. In fact, most of the COVID restriction policies always hamper this industry in an unfair manner. Lets hope the govts get some sense and stop the bloodbath in the industry.\n\nThe current data doesn't show any impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 virus. In my opinion, this wave is not going to last as long as first and second waves and will probably create minimum disruption compared with previous waves. \n\nI will try to update this post again once the Omicron situation is fully under control and see what impact it had on the economy.\n\nLet me know if you want to see any other indicators in the post, I will try to incorporate it in the next update.\n\nUntil next time."<br />Author: 'eternalrocket'  id: 's4lu86'<br />Score:76<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s4lu86/a_look_at_the_state_of_the_indian_economy_using/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why I am depressed-the upcoming Christianisation of India'<br />Body: ' [https://structures.substack.com/p/the-real-danger-is-not-muslims-it](https://structures.substack.com/p/the-real-danger-is-not-muslims-it)\n\nWhen I was a child reading all the Amar Chitra Katha comics I always thought and wished I was there to tell people ‚Äú*Wake up don‚Äôt do this this will destroy your country* ‚Äù, whether it be during the British colonialism or during the Islamic invasion when our kings formed a truce. I always thought what idiots they are that they make such stupid decisions with no thought as to what can happen in the future. I wish I was there born in that time, maybe I could warn them and stop this from happening. However today I realize even if I was there I would not be able to have done anything.\n\nToday I feel India is in the same position, **I am screaming, crying but no one can hear me, people are idling, going about as if its Business As Usual**\\- an impending change is happening -one that can be seen, felt but no one seems to be doing anything- the Christianization of India(*Hold on before you dismiss me please .The stats and the data is below -read it and than decide whether I am crazy or not)*.\n\nFor the better part of last 3-4 months I have been constantly mailing, posting on groups ,petitioning the right wing leadership(the RSS,BJP and even the VHP) to take action, block conversions but it has yet to see a response. In what I have seen the BJP leadership seems to be - caring more for short term political considerations than stop what‚Äôs happening(supporting YSR congress in AP polls, catching Islamic conversion while completely ignoring the massive christian conversion organisations, the organization they are FCRA blocking seem to be speaking more against Modi then doing conversions ). While the RSS leadership seems to be out of step - aged men sleeping behind the wheel.\n\nI know this probably wont make a difference but I request once again everyone to please ask your Hindu leadership to raise this issue- mail them, call them, petition them, ask them to please speak about it and take action.\n\n**Why the number of Christian conversions is understated:**\n\nAlthough most articles today call for no worries saying that the nos. are insignificant etc. What these articles fail to dismiss is that most people do not change their religion on paper like we don‚Äôt do most things on paper. Thus while the demographics are changing our data is not reflecting it in many states.\n\nYet where it is reflecting the data shows how fast the demographics are changing -Arunachal Pradesh went to Christianity being the majority religion in a short period from 1981-2011(google/wikipedia it if you dont believe me). Nepal went from 1% estimated population in 2011 to 10% in 2021(lower level estimates).\n\nSimilarly the % in Andhra Pradesh is estimated close to 20%(Check out the Swarajya Article),Punjab 10%.,Tamil Nadu close to 10%.\n\nHistorically if we see other countries South Korea went from 1% Christianity to Christianity being the largest religion in 3 decades.Africa went from 10 million christians to 400 million christians within a century.\n\nMany will say that the people getting converted are Dalits and backwards who have been discriminated in the Hindu community but this is clearly not the case Arunachal Pradesh -which has no caste discrimination has been a severe victim thus nullifying the theory.\n\nChristians organisations are trying to convert India because the existence and success of a non-Abrahamic religion presents a threat -a clear rejection of the need for Christianity. Interestingly when the Indian PM Narendra Modi went to visit the pope - the pope brazenly gave him a scroll with the gospel story of the outsider saving the people of the country.\n\n*‚ÄúThe wilderness will become a fruitful field‚Äù, a quotation from the Old Testament Book of the Prophet Isaiah, Chapter 32, verse 15. In this biblical verse, there is a hope of better governance in the land. Pope Francis did not convey the message directly but through a parable, which is the language of Jesus. Parable is a story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told in the Gospels. In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, which is universally known, Jesus uses the example of the Jew and the Samaritan, a native of Samaria, the region of ancient Palestine. When the Jew was dying on the road, it was the Samaritan, hated by the Jews, who rescued him and not his own brother Jews, who passed by.‚Äù*\\- from the print'<br />Author: 'ramesh-suresh'  id: 's4de98'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/s4de98/why_i_am_depressedthe_upcoming_christianisation/</li>

I am actually from Odisha and somewhat knew that Odisha and Jharkhand do share some similarites. Same goes for the tourist places.)*\n\nJuhar!\n\nWelcome to the 10th Geography and Cultural Thread Series. The state that is featured in this series is Jharkhand! Jharkhand folks, do tell us more about the History, People, Food. Culture\n\nJharkhand is an state in the Eastern Region of India.\n\nThe state was formed in 2000. Before 2000, it was part of Bihar. Before Bihar, Bihar and Jharkhand were part of Orissa Province.\n\n**Physical Geography**\n\nClimate of Jharkhand varies from Humid Subtropical in the north to tropical wet and dry in the south-east. The main seasons are summer, rainy, autumn, winter and spring. The summer lasts from mid-April to mid-June. The southwest monsoon, from mid-June to October, brings nearly all the state's annual rainfall, which ranges from about 1,000\xa0mm (40\xa0in) in the west-central part of the state to more than 1,500\xa0mm (60\xa0in) in the southwest. Nearly half of the annual precipitation falls in July and August. The winter season lasts from November to February.\n\n**About Jharkhand**\n\nFormed in 2000, Jharkhand is a state with melting pots of culture and diversity. It has many industrial cities in it.\n\nJharkhand is known to host some of the industrial cities.\n\nThe capital of Jharkhand is Ranchi and the other well known City for industrial activities is Jamshedpur. Interestingly, Dumka is the sub capital of Jharkhand.\n\n**Why was Jharkhand separated**\n\nBihar and Jharkhand were part of Orissa Province (Present day: Odisha)\n\nAs a result, there had been a lot of resistance from groups to create a new state called Jharkhand. In 1928, before India attained independence, demands for a seperate state was presented to Simon Commission. However, it was rejected.\n\nThereafter, Bihar split from Orissa and became another state. However, after the Indian Independence, Jharkhand suffered a lot in terms of socioeconomic areas.\n\nIn 1954 and 1973, a similar proposal was presented to the State Reorganisation Committee. A new party, Jharkhand Party was formed in Bihar and they won a good majority to submit a memorandum to Faizal Ali, Chairman of States Reorganisation Organisation Committee. The Committee had published a report in 1955. (Report:[https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/State%20Reorganisation%20Commisison%20Report%20of%201955\\_270614.pdf](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/State%20Reorganisation%20Commisison%20Report%20of%201955_270614.pdf)) However, the committee too had rejected the proposal. The Congress Govt decided to not listen to demands.\n\nMoreover, many Jharkhand folks felt that the Bihar administration was unjust and imbalanced in terms of providing development to Jharkhand. Another reason was that Bihar and Jharkhand did not share a common language which made things even worse.\n\nTherefore when BJP came into power, Jharkhand people found trust in BJP and indeed, in 2000, under late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jharkhand was formed through the Bihar Reorganisation Act,2000. BJP realised the purpose of Jharkhand and understood the demands of Jharkhand. \\[From: International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Invention ISSN (Online): 2319 ‚Äì 7722, ISSN (Print): 2319 ‚Äì 7714 [www.ijhssi.org](http://www.ijhssi.org/) Volume 2 Issue 4 «Å April. 2013«Å PP.01-06 \\]\n\nToday, Jharkhand is booming state where they have benefitted a lot from the industrial revolution that happened before the separation.\n\nHowever, the recent Niti Aayog report shows that Jharkhand is lagging behind in terms of poverty and the state is in desire of ensuring its people have enough nutrition, have proper sanitation, and many others.([https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-jharkhand-up-poorest-states-in-india-niti-aayog-7643398/](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-jharkhand-up-poorest-states-in-india-niti-aayog-7643398/))\n\nIt is indeed a good decision by PM Atal and his government to craft out a new state, Jharkhand for the benefit of the Jharkhand folks.\n\nTwo parties are dominant in the state; BJP and JMM.\n\n**Interesting Facts**\n\n1. Jharkhand is known for having many tribal groups and as such there are multiple languages. According to the Jharkhand Tourism, there are a total of 32 tribal groups and they are classified into  \n\n   1. Hunter-Gatherer type\n   2. Shifting Agriculture\n   3. Simple Artisian\n   4. Settled Agriculturalist\n   5. Immigrants from other states.\n2. 39.8% of tribes are Hindu, 14.8% of tribes are Christians and less than half percent (0.4%) Muslims. Some of the religions that are based on Christanity are known as Sarna and Sarna Union.\n3. Interestingly, as per the old records which date back to 1903, Jharkhand received many groups of people who migrated from North India and some of the major adivasi groups were the Mundas, Santals Oraons and the Hos.\n4. It is suggested that the adivasi groups have their roots going back to the Indo-Aryan times. However, during British Colonial rule', the way these groups were represented and marginalized resulted in these groups being very much impoverished. Moreover, these groups tended to be from hilly areas where there was less development. Therefore, the British adopted an isolationist policy with regards to this group. After independence , these groups were classified under the Scheduled Tribes.\n5. According to a 1991 Government of India statistics, when (Jharkhand was under Bihar,) Bihar had 5.3 million tribal people out of which 91.7% were from the regions of present day Jharkhand. Therefore, BJP government under Atal ji decided to carve out Jharkhand.\n\nAdapted from: ([https://archive.org/details/discoursesofethn0000deva/page/26/mode/2up?q=scheduled+tribes](https://archive.org/details/discoursesofethn0000deva/page/26/mode/2up?q=scheduled+tribes))\n\nMore information: [https://www.jharkhand.gov.in/Home/AboutTribals](https://www.jharkhand.gov.in/Home/AboutTribals)\n\n**Languages of Jharkhand**\n\nSanthali, Bengali, Karmali, Khairya, Mundari,\n\n[https://www.mapsofindia.com/jharkhand/language.html](https://www.mapsofindia.com/jharkhand/language.html)\n\n**Cuisine**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dhuska \\(https:\\/\\/medhaavi.in\\/street-food-in-india\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gr4cjd737nb81.jpg?width=440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12984aa8205e51dec70645f61ed7e4079002c84c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thekua \\(https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Thekua\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dbtdo4757nb81.jpg?width=375&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9936b48fe80b411a79d9357b29cad86f96c442f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Litti Chokka \\(https:\\/\\/www.whiskaffair.com\\/litti-chokha-bihari-litti-recipe\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wi226mu67nb81.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3db5d54a931e78c6e18edfc57dae50d7e05f5b49)\n\n[Chilka Roti https:\\/\\/www.holidify.com\\/pages\\/food-of-jharkhand-1648.html](https://preview.redd.it/vh6zfhb87nb81.jpg?width=630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6a7e432ab7993e37cc3f1a0ffcab44a7581c174)\n\n**Places of Interests**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Jonha Falls Ranchi](https://preview.redd.it/mb3rnr2a7nb81.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c1bed3c155a5390fb5b97ebab1bbb69537e768c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Jagannath Temple \\(Second largest after Puri Jagannath\\) \\(https:\\/\\/www.transindiatravels.com\\/jharkhand\\/ranchi\\/tourist-places-to-visit-in-ranchi\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/up5argib7nb81.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4a673a2a273797f11c63d3ece32e9d18f069d61)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Shri Sammed Shikharji Teerth Kshetra \\(https:\\/\\/www.shikharjiup.org\\/Prakash-Bhawan-Near-By-Places-To-Visit\\)](https://preview.redd.it/p7v1s38e7nb81.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=099118244479bb92f8428855da270e0a3bfff4bb)\n\n[Bokaro Steel City \\(https:\\/\\/www.bokaroonline.in\\/city-guide\\/bokaro-tourism\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tulajitf7nb81.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=700692ab1f843be7eb53386b60438893de917f66)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Massanjore Dam \\(https:\\/\\/www.holidify.com\\/state\\/jharkhand\\/massanjore-dam-sightseeing-1258561.html\\)](https://preview.redd.it/p36d7vti7nb81.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac59756d987877b4d81728d713b567ce62a6c386)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bhatinda Waterfalls \\(https:\\/\\/www.thetoptours.com\\/asia\\/india\\/jharkhand\\/dhanbad\\/beautiful-places-in-dhanbad\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tv5na94q7nb81.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edda6f48e7c68f539f79e518f3d34466a184e587)\n\n**Festivals**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Karma Puja - Spirtual and religious festival for the tribal community](https://preview.redd.it/b8abq17s7nb81.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7aab45de1ddc7d879a4fdcb7c76bcea84aa7e6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sarhul Festival - New Year , celebrated by the Oraon,the Munda and the Tribes](https://preview.redd.it/4c7gyuut7nb81.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e3c2eb20556ac0597d144dab76096b0f3443d2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMakar/Tusu Parab - Mostly seen in the area between Bundu, Tamar and Raidh area of Jharkhand.
