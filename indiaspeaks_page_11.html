      <li>Title::: 'Vikramaditya; reconstructing the interregnum of 57 BC ‚Äì 78 AD'<br />Body: '\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Myth:** Vikramaditya never existed, he‚Äôs just a legendary ruler based on Chandragupta II; there is no epigraphy or coinage issued by him, and he is not mentioned in the dynastic histories (*vamsanucharita*) of the Puranas.\n\n**Overcorrection:** Vikramaditya not only existed, but became a world-emperor, ruling over the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe and Western China.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Maurya-Gupta interregnum (180 BC ‚Äì 250 AD), in particular the period 57 BC ‚Äì 78 AD, was a giant mess when it comes to the history of North-Western India.\n\nSouth India under the Satavahanas and North India under the Shungas and successive Magadhan dynasties prospered in this period under relatively stable Vedic governance. In the North-West, however, the situation could only be described as political *chaos*.\n\nThere is already confusion about the political history in the period of Greco-Bactrian invasions before 57 BC \\[1\\], and during the period of Scythian invasions, sovereignty was fuzzy and fluctuating, borders were non-constant or even ill-defined, and the chronology is highly uncertain. It would perhaps be most accurate to refer to the period as a complex multipartite war between the Greco-Bactrians, Scythians, Parthians, Yuezhi and local and imperial Indic states.\n\nIn the midst of all this chaos, there is one name that shines most brightly: Vikramaditya of Ujjain ‚Äì who, as per traditional record, emerged victorious over the invaders and established a glorious golden age of prosperity and governance in accordance with Vedic laws. His victory over the Scythians c. 57 BC marks the epoch of the Vikrama Samvat, the traditional Hindu calendar ‚Äì and his name was immortalized by history as a regal title, equivalent to ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù in Europe or ‚ÄúAlexander‚Äù in Persia. \n\nThe purpose of this text is to reconstruct a precise history of the period between 57 BC ‚Äì 78 AD based on the primary sources available to us. \n\nIf you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the historical context, read the background chapters first.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n* Historicity of Vikramaditya\n* Reconstructing the period 57 BC ‚Äì 78 AD\n* Aftermath: 78 ‚Äì 250\n* Background: start of the barbarian invasions\n* Background: 180 ‚Äì 57 BC\n\n**Historicity of Vikramaditya**\n\nI will note, first of all, that even in the absence of more precise evidence, it is justified to be biased in favor of Vikramaditya‚Äôs historicity: the Scythians, who entered India as barbarians c. 57 BC, had become thoroughly Indianized by 78 AD ‚Äì contributing extensively to Sanskrit epigraphy, quoting from Hindu materialist philosophy, holding Swayamvaras, issuing land grants and donating brides to Brahmins, and for some reason revering toilets as sacred. Now it‚Äôs *possible* that this was a concerted Scythian effort to appear cool to the subjects they ruled over, as historians claim, but other possibilities are also likely. \n\nThe most informative secondary source I found on this matter is Luniya (1972) \\[2\\] (quick popular summary \\[3\\]), which is comprehensive. I will reproduce his arguments below.\n\nHistorians claim that the Vikrama Calendar (the most obvious evidence in favor of Vikramaditya‚Äôs historicity) doesn‚Äôt appear until the year 737, well after the end of the Gupta period. \n\nHowever, this is only true in a very technical sense. The *Yupa* inscriptions \\[4\\], made between the 3rd and 5th centuries, are all dated based on an era beginning in 57 BC called the *Krta* era:\n\n* The Nandsa sacrificial pillar, dated to Krta year 282 \\[5\\]\n* The Badwa sacrificial pillar, dated to Krta year 295 \\[6\\] \n* The Barnala sacrificial inscriptions, dated to Krta year 284 and 335 \\[7\\]\n* The Vijaygarh inscriptions, dated to Krta year 428\n* The Mandsour inscription, dated to Krta year 461 \\[alongside later inscriptions\\]\n* The Gangadhara inscription, dated to Krta year 480\n* The Nagari inscription, dated to Krta year 481 \\[alongside earlier inscriptions\\]\n\nThen between the 5th and 10th centuries, the same era appears under the name of the *Malava* era:\n\n* The Mandsour inscription of 461 refers to the era as both Krta and Malava \\[8\\]\n* The Mandsour inscription of Kumaragupta, dated in the era of the Malava Republic\n* The Mandsour inscription of Yashodharman, dated in the era of the Malava Republic year 589\n* The Kanaswa inscription of Sivagana, dated to Malava year 795 \\[9\\]\n* The Gyaraspur inscription, dated to Malava year 936 \\[10\\]\n\nAnd finally inscriptions from the 9th century on use the term *Vikrama* era:\n\n* The Ahara inscription of Allata, dated to Vikrama year 810\n* The Dhaulpur inscription of Chanda-Mahasena, dated to Vikrama year 973\n* The Bijapur inscription of the Rashtrakuta Vidagdharaja, dated to Vikrama year 973\n* A Bodhagaya inscription, dated to Vikrama year 1005\n* The Ekalingaji inscription of Naravahan, dated to Vikrama year 1028\n* The Vasantagadh inscription of Purnapala, dated to Vikrama year 1099\n\nThis establishes a cultural continuity in the use of the era ‚Äì It‚Äôs far harder to accept that people in 225 were ignorant of the events of 57 BC, than that people in 810 were. Also, since the earliest appearances of the Krta era predate Chandragupta II, the theory that Vikramaditya is entirely a character based on Chandragupta II is demonstrably false.\n\nLuniya has an interesting theory for the change of terminology: he suggests that the earlier omission of the personal name from the name of the era is a result of the republican nature of the Malavas; Vikramaditya was the chief of a republic, rather than a king, and thus their victory would not be attributed to him alone. Once this republican origin was forgotten, Vikramaditya received individual veneration. \n\nOf course, this is speculative, but it would also resolve the other argument against Vikramaditya‚Äôs historicity: his apparent omission from dynastic histories in the Puranas. Luniya points out that the Puranas \\[11\\] *do* mention the Gardabhila dynasty, a house of the Malavas, which later Jain literature associates with Vikramaditya.\n\nHistorians claim that there is no numismatic evidence for Vikramaditya. This appears to just be blatantly false on multiple levels. First, early Indian coins (until Vasishthiputra Pulumavi, c. 100 AD) did not carry legends or kings‚Äô portraits, but instead simple geometric designs. Second, hordes of unidentified coins have been found from the period, including at Ujjain. In particular, more than 6000 coins have been found at Malavanagara \\[12\\] -- one group of such coins explicitly bears one of two Brahmi legends:\n\n&gt;*Malavanam Jayah*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The victory of the Malavas)\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;*Malava Ganasya Jayah*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(The victory of the Malava Republic)\n\nSome of these coins contain a king‚Äôs portrait, the others have a vase, lion, bull, fan-tail-peacock, etc. as the reverse design.\n\nFor completeness I will mention that there are also some bolder claims from more recent times \\[13\\], claiming to have found coins with a portrait of Vikramaditya; these appear to me as unreliable at least in their reporting. \n\nEven in the absence of such explicitly positive evidence, there would have been reason to believe the historicity of Vikramaditya; namely, the radical change in the culture of the Scythians between 57 BC and 78 AD, which is likely to be attributed to powerful influence from Ujjain. In particular, the Sanskrit epigraphy that the Indo-Scythians later became famous for has its roots in earlier Malava Sanskrit epigraphy (namely the Hathibada Ghosundi inscriptions \\[14\\]).\n\nThus all that needs to be ascertained is the precise level of power and territorial extent the Malavas had through this period.\n\n**Reconstructing the period 57 BC ‚Äì 78 AD**\n\n(Again, if you are not familiar with the background of the Greco-Bactrian and other invasions of India starting 180 BC, I suggest reading the background sections first.) \n\nWe will first list the important primary-sourced facts based on which we will make our inferences:\n\n* The Scythian invader Maues had overstruck of the coins of the Indo-Greek Archebius in Taxila. \n* An Indo-Greek coin bearing the inscription ‚Äú*rajatirajasa moasa putrasa (ca) artemidorosa*‚Äù, reading either as ‚ÄúMaues‚Äôs son Artemidoros‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaues and the son of Artemidoros‚Äù; in either case, Maues allied with at least some Indo-Greek houses.\n* The Parthian Vonones of Sakastan briefly occupied Taxila during Maues‚Äôs reign, as evidenced by his coinage. \n* Vonones‚Äôs successors Spalahores and Spalirisos were both Scythians, and did not occupy Taxila; thus various Parthian and Scythian houses were allied or even mixed in their invasion of India. \n* Indo-Greek Apollodotus II later overstruck Maues‚Äôs coins in Taxila, probably after Maues‚Äôs death.\n* The Indo-Scythian Azes ruled Taxila sometime after these early Parthians, and overstruck the Greek coins. His successor was Azilises.\n* The Apracharajas who ruled from Bajaur (a little North of Taxila) seemed to be much more Indian, although they are typically classified as Indo-Scythian. They were probably descended from the Vedic Ashvakas (based on their name and their region); their rulers‚Äô names are very Indic; their language, script and philosophies appear to have been Indic. The names of some Queen consorts are more Iranian, however, and they feature some Greek deities on their coins, so they may have mixed with Scythians and Greeks. Their territory probably did not extend much beyond Taxila. \n* Zeionises ruled from West of Taxila, contemporary to some of the Apracharajas, and may have briefly occupied it. His successor was Kharahostes, who was apparently allied with the Apracharajas \\[15\\] as suggested by the Silver Reliquary of Indravarman, so it is possible these were simply allied houses that ruled Taxila jointly in a republican fashion. The Mathura Lion Capital inscription refers to this house as Kamuia, which may be Kamboja (which would again suggest significant mixing between such tribes). \n* The Indo-Parthian Gondophares certainly occupied Taxila at some point, it was their capital; they‚Äôre often held to have ruled the entirety of territory from Sakala to Sindh, but these are probably fanciful accounts based on Philostratus‚Äôs unreliable *Life of Apollonius Tyana*.\n* Kharahostes‚Äôs son Mujatria and the Apraca ruler Sasan were again sovereign, and are known to be contemporary with the Kushan invader Kujula Kadphises (45‚Äî50 AD) based on hoard finds and overstrikes on Mujatria‚Äôs coins by Kujula‚Äôs successor Vima Takto. \n* But the Indo-Parthian Abdagases I (45‚Äî60 AD) *also* issued coins at Taxila \\[16\\]. So again, battlefield. Or vassals, but this seems unlikely.\n* The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 70‚Äî80 AD) attests a Scythian kingdom in Sindh with Minnagara as its capital, and mentions the circulation of coins with Greek legends in Bharuch \\[17\\].\n* The Scythians Hagamasha and Hagana are known to have issued coins in Mathura at some point, and were called *Kshatrapas*. Rajuvula was referred to as a *Mahakshatrapa*. These two may have been predecessors of Rajuvula, his successors, or his contemporary vassals. \n* There are coins issued by an Indo-Greek ruler Strato II, many of which are found alongside Rajuvula‚Äôs at Sakala and Mathura \\[18\\] \\[19\\], suggesting that (1) they are contemporaries and (2) that the Indo-Greek kingdom rose again at some point between 20 BC and 10 AD. \n* Sodasa was Rajuvula‚Äôs son, as per the Mathura lion capital. His inscriptions are only found in Mathura, so the Scythian territories in Sakala were probably lost again in this period.\n* No Scythian rulers are attested in Mathura from Sodasa c. 15 AD until Kharapallana and Vanaspara, vassals of Kanishka I c. 130.\n* Kujula Kadphises issued coins in Taxila \\[20\\] \\[21\\].\n* For dating: the Taxila copper plate, suggesting a Maues era starting in 72 BC; the Bajaur relinquary inscription, suggesting an Azes era starting in 45 BC, and dating the Apracharaja Vijayamitra‚Äôs reign to 12 BC ‚Äì 20 AD. The precise regnal years of the Apracharajas ‚Äì Vijayamitra, Indravasu, Visnuvarma, Indravarman, Aspavarma, Sasan ‚Äì overlap and are weird as everything else here is. Western records clarify Indo-Parthian rule to have began c. 19 AD. Rajuvula‚Äôs reign is pinned down to c. 10 AD by the Mathura lion capital that establishes his generational relationship to Kharahostes. Kujula Kadiphses is known to have existed c. 70 AD.\n\nI will add some comments about the Scythian rulers of Mathura, aka ‚ÄúThe Northern Satraps‚Äù.\n\nI find the mainstream data of 60‚Äî50 BC for the Scythian conquest of Mathura to be highly improbable for several reasons: (1) that would mean stable and long reigns for Hagamasha and Hagana, quite rare in this chaotic period (2) Strato II‚Äôs coins at Mathura paint a picture of a Rajavula invading from the West, rather than his dynasty already having been established at Mathura. Thus I find it likely that Hagamasha and Hagana were either vassals of Rajavula, his successors, or minor Scythian houses that were involved in a multipartite struggle for Mathura (which succeeded upon Rajavula‚Äôs ascension) in a short period before him.\n\nThe other question is who these Northern Satraps were Satraps to. Perhaps they were satraps to the Scythians at Taxila as mainstream history holds (this seems unlikely, since Sodasa did not control Sakala and so this would mean being vassal to a territory he was not contiguous with) or to some other Indian state, but it seems more likely to me that they used the terms in a similar manner to the later Western Satraps: the reigning monarch was called a *Mahakshatrapa*, and his princes were called *Kshatrapas*.\n\nHere‚Äôs the whole political history summarized. If anyone has the time to make an Ollie Bye-style visualization of this, be my guest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Year|Taxila|Sakala|Mathura|Sindh|Bharuch|Ujjain|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|180 BC|Gandhara x Greek|Ayudhajivi|Mitra|Misc Indic|Misc Indic|Shunga|\n|170 BC|Greek x Gandhara|Ayudhajivi|Mitra|Greek|Misc Indic / Greek |Malava|\n|160 BC|Greek|Greek|Mitra x Greek|Greek|Misc Indic / Greek |Malava|\n|100 BC|Greek|Ayudhajivi|Mitra|Greek / Misc Indic|Greek / Misc Indic|Malava|\n|70 BC|Scythian x Parthian|Ayudhajivi|Mitra|Misc Indic / Greek|Misc Indic / Greek |Malava|\n|57 BC|Greek|Ayudhajivi|Mitra|Misc Indic / Greek|Misc Indic / Greek |Malava|\n|45 BC|Scythian|Ayudhajivi / Scythian|Mitra|Misc Indic|Misc Indic|Malava|\n|12 BC|Apracaraja + Kamboja |Ayudhajivi x Greek|Mitra x Greek|Misc Indic|Misc Indic|Malava|\n|0|Apracaraja + Kamboja |Scythian x Greek|Scythian x Greek|Misc Indic / Scythian|Misc Indic / Scythian|Malava|\n|10|Apracaraja + Kamboja |Scythian|Scythian|Misc Indic / Scythian|Misc Indic / Scythian|Malava|\n|19|Parthian|Ayudhajivi|Scythian|Misc Indic / Scythian / Parthian|Misc Indic / Scythian|Malava|\n|50|(Apracaraja + Kamboja) x Parthian|Ayudhajivi|Misc Indic|Misc Indic / Scythian|Misc Indic / Scythian|Malava|\n|78|Kushan|Ayudhajivi|Misc Indic|Scythian|Scythian|Malava|\n|130|Kushan|Kushan|Kushan|Scythian|Scythian|Scythians x Malava|\n|250|Kushan|Ayudhajivi|Naga|Sassanian|Misc Indic|Malava|\n\nKey: / means ‚Äúor‚Äù, + means ‚Äúin alliance with‚Äù, x means ‚Äúadversarial to‚Äù \n\n**Aftermath: 78 ‚Äì 250**\n\nI will say a couple of things about the Scythian resurgence in the 1st century.\n\nThese Scythians were divided into two houses: the Kshaharatas and the Kardamakas. The Kshaharatas were Bhumaka and Nahapana; the Kardamakas included Chastana (crowned 78) and Rudradaman (crowned 130). \n\nIt is often said that the Kshaharatas ruled strictly before the Kardamakas, but there was probably some overlap ‚Äì Nahapana was defeated by Gautamiputra Satakarni, while Rudradaman (who was Chastana‚Äôs grandson) fought Gautamiputra‚Äôs son Vashishtiputra Satakarni. \n\nThese Scythians grew very powerful on account of their alliances; they were at complete peace with the Kushans, and they gave some daughters in marriage to the Satavahanas. Well, a certain Satavahana emperor is known to have accidentally killed his wife during intercourse\\[22\\], so it is no surprise that the latter alliance was a bit more unstable.\n\nThese Scythians were highly Sanskritized culturally, and were primarily affected by Vedic political philosophy (although they also donated to Buddhists) ‚Äì their inscriptions contain descriptions of the Purushartha philosophy in pure Sanskrit, they issued land grants and kanyadanas to Brahmins, held and participated in Swayamvaras, employed Brahmin ministers, fought wild tribes and built infrastructure (especially cisterns, which they held to be sacred), spared defeated rulers, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Rudradaman, who is the lord of the whole of Malwa, Gujarat, Marwar, Sindh, Sauvira (Multan), Kukura (East Rajasthan), Aparanta (Northern Konkan), Nishada (tribals) and other territories gained by his own valour, the cities, marts and rural parts of which are never troubled by robbers, snakes, wild beasts, diseases and the like, where all subjects are attached to him, and where through his might the goals of righteousness, wealth and pleasure are duly attained.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚Äì Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;He who by the right raising of his hand has caused the strong attachment of Dharma, who has attained wide fame by studying and recalling, by the knowledge and practice of grammar, music, logic, and other great sciences, who is proficient in the management of horses, elephants and chariots, the wielding of sword and shield, pugilistic combat, in acts of quickness and skill in opposing forces ‚Ä¶ who has been wreathed with many garlands at the *swayamvaras* of princesses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚Äì Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Rudradaman, who obtained good report because he, in spite of having twice in fair fight completely defeated Satakarni, the lord of Dakshinapatha, on account of the nearness of their connection did not destroy him.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚Äì Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The meritorious gift of Ayama of the Vachhasagotra, prime minister of the King Mahakshatrapa the lord Nahapana.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;‚Äì Junnar inscription of Nahapana, 26.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Success!

The political stability that Chanakya had created disappeared, and seven different Mauryan kings ruled in the next 50 years, before the dynasty was overthrown in a coup by Pushyamitra Shunga in 180 BC. The Shunga empire, as well as the Satavahana empire in the Deccan, were not only Vedic in their governance, their rulers were Brahmins by caste. The political power that the Buddhists had gathered during Ashoka‚Äôs reign disappeared.\n\n(There is a certain analogy between the Maurya-Gupta interregnum and the Trump administration in the modern U.S. Here, Vedic philosophy is analogous to conservatism, and Buddhism is analogous to the left. While Vedic ideas were executed very efficiently, it became more of a big-tent philosophy, compromising on ideological purity; furthermore, while Vedism nominally won the battle in terms of *political* power, Buddhism‚Äôs *cultural* foothold only expanded.) \n\nThere is significant evidence that many politically influential Indian Buddhists were complicit in the barbarian invasions; the Milinda Panha describes Buddhist monks traveling to Central Asia to advise Menander I, Pushyamitra Shunga is recorded to have executed several Buddhists in Sakala for treason, and the Jains blame themselves (the Jain monk Kalaka) for inviting the Scythians to invade India, probably an appropriation of a Buddhist act (considering that the Jains were themselves persecuted by Ashoka, and Kharavela, who repelled Menander I‚Äôs invasion, was a Jain). As many Buddhists had been appointed to positions of political power under Ashoka and the same state infrastructure continued to exist under the early Shungas, it seems reasonable that they were capable of betraying the Shungas in some critical way.\n\nAn alternate reading is that the Greeks fanned the civil war within the Maurya empire to facilitate their invasion ‚Äì this reading is supported by some supposed verses from texts called the *Parampara-pustaka* and the *Yavanarajya-Vrttanta* \\[23\\], but I was not able to find these original texts, and I am doubtful of their authenticity. \n\n**Background (180 ‚Äì 57 BC)**\n\nMessy notions of sovereignty predate the Scythian invasion. The Greco-Bactrian invaders themselves were highly decentralized into several houses, etc. and their relationships with existing Indian rulers were complicated (the latter were not deposed, but were also not on friendly terms necessarily ‚Äì thus the state can only be described as war).\n\nDemetrius I was the first of these invaders, who made it only as far as Taxila c. 180 BC. Several rulers are described in his immediate succession, including Pantaleon, Agathocles, Antimachus I, Antimachus II, Apollodotus I (it is unclear what their relationship was).\n\nApollodotus I was the most significant of these successors, who expanded Southward to Sindh (where his coins are found). He may have also attempted an invasion of Bharuch (as per the Periplus), but he was probably repelled by the Satavahanas.\n\nTaxila and other cities in Gandhara continued to mint coins in the traditional Indian standard alongside Indo-Greek coins \\[24\\] ‚Äì this could suggest the existence of private coinage, but I find it more likely that the Indo-Greek houses existed alongside local Indian dynasties, and that these houses were adversarial to each other (as the existence of competing coinage shows), rather than vassal or allied \\[25\\].\n\nMenander I‚Äôs invasion c. 160 BC was much more serious, and is discussed extensively in Indian literature, such as in the fawning Buddhist Milinda Panha, which states that he ruled from Sakala (Punjab); he also certainly brought Taxila under his direct sovereign control, as local Taxila coinage ceases in this period. Besides his possessions in the Punjab region, though, his other expeditions are more confusing.\n\nIt is known that Menander launched a Gangetic campaign, with his army reaching Pataliputra (some historians are skeptical of this invasion, but it seems like obvious historical fact to me, corroborated by multiple sources \\[26\\]) ‚Äì however, this only amounted to a brief raid, and the famed Kalinga hero Kharavela repelled him back to Mathura at least. \n\nIn Mathura too, coins of local Indian rulers ‚Äì bearing names amounting to the *Deva*, *Dutta* and *Mitra* dynasties ‚Äì are found uninterrupted alongside Indo-Greek coins. However, Greek control over Mathura is also described in Indian sources (e.g. the Yavanarajya inscription and various Puranas, although interestingly the Milinda Panha makes no mention of this). \n\nThere are some oft-quoted verses from the Vayu Purana 99.362, 99.383, tertially attributed to a certain Morton Smith 1973:\n\n&gt;*Asui dve ca varsani bhoktaro Yavana mahim*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Mathuram ca purim ramyam Yauna bhoksyanti sapta vai*\n\nI wasn‚Äôt able to find these words in the Vayu Purana \\[27\\], and I suspect that it is a fabrication, even if the inference may be justified.\n\n&gt;The figure, 82 years for the duration of Yavana rule which Cunningham cited (NC 1872 p. 185), as it is not a round number, might be a real tradition for some particular place; if so, that place must be Mathura, as the figure is far too small for anywhere else except Sindh or Saurashtra, which cannot come in question as because later Puranic history is confined to the United Provinces and Bihar (CHI p. 307). This would make the \\[Indo-Greeks‚Äô\\] loss of Mathura shortly after 100 BC.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(WW Tran, The Greeks in Bactria and India, p. 324 \\[28\\])\n\nI was able to find:\n\n&gt;*Thereafter, the untruthful and unrighteous Yavanas of great fury and little grace will rule here spreading their religion, spending vast riches and giving vent to their lust.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Those kings will not be duly crowned. They will have all the defects of the Kali Yuga. They will commit evil actions.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*During the remaining period of the Kali Yuga, the kings will enjoy the Earth, not even hesitating to kill women and children and to destroy one another.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*They will be devoid of Dharma, Kama, Artha (righteousness, love, wealth). All the common people coming into close contact with them, too will follow the customs and habits of barbarians.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*They will act contrary to accepted traditions. They will destroy their subjects. The kings will be greedy and devoted to mendacious behaviour.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When their turn is over, women will outnumber men in that age. People will become increasingly deficient in learning and strength. Their lifespans will shrink.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Vayu Purana, translated by GV Tagare, Part 2, 37.382-289 / p. 820-821.)\n\nIt seems likely that Mathura and other densely populated regions may have become a battlefield between Indian rulers and the Greeks without enjoying a stable government ‚Äì much like Taxila had been during Demetrius‚Äôs invasion ‚Äì while the Punjab, including Taxila, had become a core Greek territory under Menander I. It is also not clear what the relationship between the Deva, Datta and Mitra dynasties was precisely: there are several other Mitra dynasties that appear throughout the Gangetic plain in Panchala, Kaushambi and Ayodhya ‚Äì it is possible these may have been private merchants or the sort of plutocratic governments mentioned in the Arthashastra and the Ashtadhyayi.\n\nThis ‚ÄúMathura as a battlefield‚Äù hypothesis is also supported by the extensive growth of fortifications in Mathura during this period; it‚Äôs also worth noting that the architecture and art of Mathura in this period was *not* influenced by Greek styles, so governance was likely predominantly Mitra, even if they may have had to pay tribute to the Greeks \\[29\\] \\[30\\].\n\nAs the Indo-Greeks were rarely a single unified state themselves (except under some rulers like Demetrius and Menander), the kingdom fragmented upon Menander‚Äôs death c. 130 BC. These fragmented Indo-Greeks quickly diminished in importance, paying tribute to Scythian invaders (where special Greek coins are found \\[31\\]) and to the Shunga empire (where various Indo-Greeks donated several monuments, both of Vaishnava and Buddhist sects).\n\nThe Ayudhajivi Sanghas (war-like republics/corporations) that ruled East of the Ravi river rebelled c. 100 BC, ending Greek rule in Eastern Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Northern Rajasthan ‚Äì notable among these corporations are the Yaudheyas, Arjunayanas, Audumbaras, Kunindas, Trigartas and Rajanyas. Their independence is known from the coins they minted with legends like \\[32\\]:\n\n&gt;*Arjunayanam Jayah*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Yaudheya Ganasaya Jayah*\n\n[Map of Ayudhajivi Sanghas \\[33\\]](https://preview.redd.it/2lyspvbulr581.png?width=215&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1715e117e036b09f5e4d0f7f5d3fef6e9a039204)\n\nThey apparently remained allied against foreign invasions for several centuries to come. See also\\[34\\]. Also interesting to note: the Yaudheyas were apparently followers of Skanda/Kartikeya, the Arjunayanas were followers of Shiva, the Audambaras honored Sage Vishvamitra but also followed Skanda and Shiva, the Kunindas followed a Vaishnava-Buddhist syncretism like the Indo-Greeks.\n\nThe remaining Indo-Greek territories in the West (centered around Taxila) were reunified under Philoxenus c. 100 BC, and then fragmented again.\n\nIt was around this time that the conflict in Central Asia between the Yuezhi and the Scythians boiled over into India, with one of them or both apparently occupying Indo-Greek territories in Paropamisadae (Western Gandhara and Kamboja), and the Indo-Greek king Hermaeus c. 80 BC is shown in conflict with these nomads.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**References**\n\n\\[1\\] Erik Seldeslachts, *The End of the Road for the Indo-Greeks*, Iranica Antiqua 39 (2004): [poj.peeters-leuven.be/secure/POJ/downloadpdf.php?ticket\\_id=600132d2b3c2e](https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/secure/POJ/downloadpdf.php?ticket_id=600132d2b3c2e) \n\n\\[2\\] BN Luniya, *Historicity of Vikramaditya*, chapter in the English section of the *Vikram Kirti Mandir Smarika* (1972).

But his most interesting role for me is his being fellow at Carnegie Endowment. Same Carnegie Endowment which has been listed by the most authorattive book on Cold War as one of the big CIA fronts (evidenced by constant exchange of positions by officials between the 2 organisations)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlobally acclaimed book on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War" elucidates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA‚Äôs intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‚ÄòAn unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.‚Äô\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA‚Äôs penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄòBona fide‚Äô foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‚Äòthe best and most plausible kind of funding cover‚Äô. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‚Äòparticularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income‚Äô. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‚Äòa seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions‚Äô from the early 1950s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n‚ÄòThere was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,‚Äô Braden explained. ‚ÄòI paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don‚Äôt know the names of all of them, I can‚Äôt remember. But it was a criss-cross of money.

      <li>Title::: 'Why BJP Govt was right in banning porn and how liberals and leftists justify sexual abuse of women and children under the garb of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù and ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù'<br />Body: '  \n\nAbout 2 years ago, my friend messaged me a link to an Indian subreddit that contained skimpily clad women gyrating on TikTok. The specific post the link contained a woman who didn‚Äôt look old enough. A few forwards later one of my other friends found out that it was a video of a 15-year-old girl from his hometown of Delhi. The girl was dancing with clothes but devoid of any underwear underneath the clothes. It was child porn. My friend and I then set about reporting all the posts of that woman on that sub. \n\nThe user has since been banned, but the sub still exists. It was very nearly taken down, but since it was only one user, it was allowed to run.\n\nThen when the government banned the TikTok from the play store, I celebrated. But I was one of the minorities, because I didn‚Äôt really cheer for the anti-China perspective of the ban, but the child porn aspect. TikTok was a hub for child predators to gather and leech at underage girls who knew nothing better. \n\nThen when the government banned porn and people lost their minds. There was nothing anti-China about this, so how could people celebrate now? Champions of ‚ÄúInternet Freedom‚Äù came out and beseeched people to fight against fascism. Fascism? Is it fascism to ban porn sites with a widespread child porn problem? Is it really that horrible to ban a medium that has only degraded and abused women to the extent that they have had to get reconstruction surgeries of their reproductive and excretory system?\n\nI wont even talk about how bad porn in to an individual, because dozens of studies have been done as to how harmful it is to the brain and how it hampers personal development, but this writeup is solely to look at the abuse that the industry perpetrates and the champions of freedom that help it spread under the garb of privacy.\n\n# In porn, consent does not mean anything. Consent is routinely violated, and women abused even when they tell their male co-stars to stop ‚Äì\n\nMultiple women pornstars have complained about multiple top male co-stars who do not stop when told to stop. They continue their abuse even after the woman cries out in pain and agony. \n\nTop male stars like James Deen, Ron Jeremy and Ryan Madison have been accused of rape by their own co-stars.\n\nThe studios that hire such individuals do not enforce it either. Nor do they take any action towards the perpetrators. \n\nThere are instances where these men have hit their women co-stars ON CAMERA, they have spit on them and have removed their contraceptive, even when the contract explicitly stated to them not to. Their reputation out of the studios is even more shady as they routinely indulge in serial rape of not just adults, but even underage females who they lure under the pretext of money and fame.\n\nWhich brings me to the next problem ‚Äì \n\n# The porn industry recruits women as young as 14 and then fakes their birth certificates to portray them as ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù. Child porn is ever-pervasive in the porn world ‚Äì\n\nTraci Lords, one of the most famous pornstars of the vintage era had made over 100 porn videos before she had turned 18. **She started acting in porn films at the age of 14**. Even today, with all the anti-paedophilia activism going on, you can still find these repulsive videos of her on top sites. They are routinely taken down and re-uploaded all the time.\n\nEven in the modern era, underage women are groomed and lured into the underbelly of pornography. They are then leeched until they are hollow shells of themselves and then discarded when they are over 20. Very few of them make it beyond 25 because the producers ply them with drugs and contraceptives to dull the agony of shooting difficult scenes.\n\nUnderage girls are sourced from all over the world. Eastern Europe is notorious for it because birth certificates can be forged easily and the children are then filmed to the producer‚Äôs content.\n\n&gt;**If you have watched porn in your life, there is a very good chance that you have watched child porn masquerading as adult porn.**\n\nYou do not have to go to the dark web to access it. There was a very high-profile case against MindTree where the prosecutors accused Pornhub of facilitating the trafficking of underage girls and encouraging child abuse. Not just facilitating, many analysts say that PornHub made obscene amounts of profit due to the exact nature of these ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù porn videos.\n\nWhich brings me to the next topic ‚Äì \n\n# The degeneracy of porn genres of barely legal, faux bait, schoolgirl, abuse, and incest fantasies ‚Äì\n\nThe women in these genres are young-looking and it is implied that they are underage. That‚Äôs the appeal of barely legal porn. They purposely dress them up as schoolgirls to satisfy the fantasies of paedophiles everywhere. What other reason can there be to call a girl ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù?\n\nThen there is the genre of incest porn, but that has been turned into a meme today, so pervasive and normalised it has become. \n\nThen there are abuse videos. I am not talking BDSM fantasies. **I am talking about straight up abuse, where the woman is kicked, slapped, spat on, urinated on and punched to satisfy demented porn enthusiast.** Again, this is mainstream porn. It is no longer a niche within the industry.\n\nSome women are abused so badly, they need reconstruction surgeries to live a normal life. Angel Smalls was one such woman whose excretory system was damaged beyond the usual damage that happens. She had to get specialist surgery to correct her bowel. She is one of the many who have to undergo such procedures. \n\nThen there is the male aspect of the porn where even male stars have regretted entering the industry. They have decimated their reproductive organs by working in the field too.\n\n**Didn‚Äôt we raise hell when the woman was gangraped in Delhi, especially when we found out how she was impaled? How is this different? Just because the woman consented and signed a piece of paper?**\n\nBecause that contract means zilch. That brings me to the next point ‚Äì \n\n# How the porn industry routinely violates contracts and lures underage girls in and commits rape very routinely ‚Äì \n\nGirls Do Porn was a website that ran for 10 WHOLE YEARS before allegations were brought against the owner and the producer. Women accused the owner for hiring women to lure in na√Øve girls under the pretext of a nude photoshoot that would be sold in Asia. \n\nWhen the women/girls finally showed up, they were denied money and told that they would have to shoot a full-fledged video spanning over two days of work. What was supposed to be a day worth of work turned into a painful two days of shoot, full of exploitation.\n\nThey lodged a class-action suit against the owner and now he is on a run, although sentenced to 20 years in prison. The legitimate porn companies made a huge deal about it, trying to show how legitimate they themselves are, but they are not. Many of their offshoot projects still run under the names of that reeks of exploitation.\n\n**The point here is, that an allegedly legitimate website ran for 10 years before rape and trafficking allegations were brought in against it. How many such websites run "legally" today?** \n\nAnd the champions of freedom are angry that the Indian govt has banned porn. Internet Freedom Foundation, is one of the chief proponents of the voice against the ban. They want the people to fight against the fascist policy that led to the ban, quietly ignoring the systemic abuse of women and underage girls that the porn industry propagates.\n\nBecause child rape and women abuse are ok, right? If they do not condone such behaviour, then they are guilty by association, right? Because that‚Äôs the line they parrot towards their adversaries. It‚Äôs not like the news of child porn on mainstream websites might have escaped them. Since they are champions of internet freedom, they must know, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThis is all drama. The leftists do not care about women‚Äôs issues one bit. They just want their hedonistic pleasures, even if that means exploitation and rape of underage women.\n\n**The BJP government did the absolute right thing by banning TikTok and porn websites. I hope they spread awareness about how the industry operates and ban it completely.**\n\nThe human race will be all the better for it.\n\nThat‚Äôs it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources ‚Äì**

      <li>Title::: "My critique of Extra History's Conquest of India Series : Part 1"<br />Body: '\n\n\nRecently a well-known YouTube channel, Extra Credits, made a series of videos, presenting a narrative of the British conquest and rule of the Indian subcontinent as part of it\'s Extra History series. The first video of the series attempted to provide a general observation and introduction of the subject, giving a brief overview of the geography, the existing consensus and the major fields of research and trends in historiography. I shall link the video here :\n\n\n[Kindly take your time watching this while you read through each section of this post](https://youtu.be/E4vonIphF4E)\n\n\nI would also like to say, that while I criticise their videos, I do not intend for this post to be perceived or interpreted as a disapproval of the channel or it\'s existing library of videos and work in general. All this being said, I shall now begin, and once again, I shall try and quote the video accurately, as well as provide time stamps for all the quotes I use.\n\n\n\n**03:50 TO 04:07**\n\n&gt;Talking about the historical paradox at the heart of the conquest, the idea that drives public interest and leads historians to dedicate their lives to this topic : How did the entire subcontinent of India become beholden to the rule of Britain a comparatively tiny island off the coast of Europe? \n\n\nThe answer to the question raised in the latter half of this section of the video is fairly straightforward, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed on the 2nd of August, 1858, the ***Act For The Better Governance Of India***, which among other provisions, liquidated the East India Company and transferred the territories, treaties, assets and institutions of the East India Company to the British Crown. This is at the heart of the problems of this video, where it fails to draw distinctions between the Company, the transitional phases of the Company and the era of the Raj, and refers to the traders who arrived on the shores of Gujurat, the British Crown and the English crown, with the same terminology, namely "British", therefore ignoring their inherent differences in implications, depending on the time period. It is indeed no Paradox that the British crown took over the EIC territories, that incident is well documented and there are no great disagreements about it. The Paradox that the video tries to draw attention to is the conquest of the subcontinent by the Company, and again, this is a Paradox only in name, as the company was never a mere commercial entity, but one which reserved the rights to own land, fortify said land, wage wars to defend it and it\'s commercial interests. Therefore, it\'s expansion can be seen as very much in line with the series of conquests that had been part and parcel of the political turmoil of the 17th and 18th centuries. And throughout it\'s existence, the company experienced changes and evolutions which transformed it from a mere commercial actor to a ruler, with administrative and military institutions to enforce said rule. There is no Paradox here, unless all of the subcontinent is seen as one political entity, simultaneously aware of the dangers posed by the company in the foreseeable future, and able and disposed to contain and prevent such outcomes as may be detrimental to it\'s status quo. However, the history of the Company and the the subcontinent reveal, that the powers that existed in the subcontinent and the Company interacted as political players, equally conscious of opportunities and necessities and that the political expansion of the Company was borne out by a multitude of factors, none of which are in and of themselves, so inexplicable, as to be considered Paradoxical to the contingent conception of historical progression. \n\n\n\n**04:55 TO 05:15**\n\n&gt;When regular contact between Britain and India began, at the start of the 17th century, their roles were very much reversed. India was the technologically advanced, wealthy, cosmopolitan empire, with diseases known for killing Europeans. While Britain was the provincial, insignificant, comparatively impoverished, backwater.\n\n\nWe can begin by addressing the inaccuracies within this section of the video one by one, in order. The first among these inaccuracies being one of nomenclature. The fact that the video asserts that regular contact between "India" and "Britian" was established in the start of the 17th century. Neither India nor Britian existed as political entities, as of yet. It would be far more prudent to refer to the contact established in 1608, on the 28th of August when Captain William Hawkins anchored his ship *Hector* off Surat, as one between the then *Subah* of Gujurat, and by extension the Mughal Empire then rules by the Emperor Jahangir, with The Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies, and by extension with the Kingdom of England, then ruled by Queen Elizabeth I, styled as the Queen of England and Ireland. The Kingdom of Britian was formed by the Treaty of Union, 22 July 1706 ( ratified and enforced by The Union with Scotland Act, 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland ). Therefore, to call the English merchants the "British", the "state" which legitimised their monopoly and their company as an institution as "Britian" and the Kingdom over which their monarch ruled as the same, is out of place and not historically accurate, since the British kingdom had not existed yet.\n\nThe next subject which requires our attention is the supposed technological edge or superiority that the Mughal Empire commanded in this time period, which once again, is the early 17th century. While a catagorical assessment of the technological aspects of the Mughal economy is both too monumental of a task to be considered by this Reddit post and altogether unnecessary for the purposes of this critique, I shall try to elaborate in brief the technological aspects of various sectors of the Mughal economy, so as to bring forth a comaprison which might allow to us test the veracity of the statement made by the video.\n\nWe may begin this assessment by first looking at the agricultural sector and the technologies employed to perform the agricultural activities which defined the lives of the vast majority of Mughal subjects and to this day employ roughly 50% of the Indian population. Here, first the distinction must be made, between agriculture or that which is known more commonly as farming and it\'s allied activities, and it must be understood that paucity of sources and space, constricts our assessment to the former.\n\nOur first point of reference may be Rev. William Tennant who provides us in his *Indian Recreations Consisting Chiefly of Structures on the Domestic and Rural Economy of the Mahommedans and Hindoos Vol II,* p. 77, the conditions of the Indian plough as a simple wooden implement, which serves to "scratch" the land, and that the land requires 3-4 exertions by this plough to create the appearance of a "tilth".\n\nWe then find in Henry Elliot\'s *Memoirs on the history, folk-lore, and distribution of the races of the North Western Provinces of India*, Vol II, 1869, p. 341 :\n\n*Of the operations of this simple plough, Dr. Tennant, who has led the van in the abuse of everything Indian, observes (" Indian Recreations,\'\' Vol. II. p. 78), " Only a few scratches are perceptible here and there, more resembling the digging of a mole than the work of a plough;\'\' yet this prejudiced and superficial observer remarks in another place that the average produce of the Province of Allahabad is fifty-six bushels of wheat to the English acre: as if these \' scratches and diggings of a mole" could by any possibility produce double the average of the scientific cultivators of England. He had forgotten also to remark that the drill, which has only within the last century been introduced into English field husbandry,.... has been in use in India since time immemorial*\n\nWe find that in terms of textile technology, there were two important implements namely the wooden worm-worked roller (*charkhi*) and the bow-scutch (*kaman*). Yet we find that the "mutli-spindle wheel illustrated in China from 1313 onwards", the "U-shaped flyer rotating around the spindle attached to it in Europe by c.1480 or again the connecting rod and treadle, developed by 1524", were absent in the Mughal economy. \n\nWith regards to land transportation, the absence of wheel barrows and horse-powered carts and carriages, is again, bewildering. \n\nNow, with regards to military technology the differences become starkly clear. For one, the flintlocks made an appearance in Europe in the early decades of the 17th century, nearly supllanting the matchlock by the end of the 17th century. Matchlocks would remain the firearm used by Mughal *banduqchi* or *tofangchi* throughout the 17th. Flintlocks not making an appearance well into the 18th century. "Indian" bellows and moulds had remained incapable of producing quality bronze cast cannons, until the arrival of the Portugese. Further developments during the reign of Akbar had resulted in the production of great bombards, however, cast iron cannons, which could substitute the costlier bronze ordnance were lacking. The technology to cast such cannons and the financial capability or the institutional framework to meet the logistical challenges and cost of producing such guns was lacking. Wrought iron cannons coated with bronze were brought into use, however, the gun carriages were rudimentary, slow and cumbersome. The best innovations of this period may be the artillery of the stirrup, which itself was an imitation with regards to horse-drawn carriages, of European artillery. Lastly the ammunition used was initially stone, rarely lead and at times hollow balls of brass, yet iron shot was not brought into use in any large number until the mid to late 17th century, and even then, the production of such shots was not domestic, but rather their acquisition was via purchase. \n\nBefore finishing this assessment, a final note on metallurgy by Irfan Habib should see us off :\n\n*In general the quantity of iron available as material for fashioning tools and mechanical parts remained extremely restricted*\n\nIn conclusion, this statement, has failed to reflect a true picture of the Mughal Empire, in an honest assessment of available sources. \n\n[ Sources :\n\n*Gunpowder and Firearms in Warfare in Medieval India* by Iqtidar Alam, 2004\n\nKhan, Irfan Habib, *The Technology and Economy of Mughal India*, in The Indian Economic and Social History Reveiw, Vol. XVII, No. 1 ]\n\n\n\n***05:24 TO 05:53***\n\n&gt;Not only were the English dwarfed at this time by imperial powers like Spain and France, but they\'d often had trouble competing against even small European states like Portugal and the Dutch Republic\n\nThis statement needs to be seen in conjunction with the statement about the "British" economy in the previous section. The following points must be considered, when assessing these statements, to draw attention to the inaccuracies of the latter :\n\nA) Wages in terms of grams of silver per day, were higher in England in the 17th century relative to the cost of consumer goods, which meant that workers could afford a better standard of living and consume more meat than their Asian or Eastern European counterparts. In 1600-1649 the nominal wages of craftsmen and labourers in London were 11.3 and 7.1 respectively. Compared with the average wages prevailing in the Mughal Empire recorded in the *Ain-i-Akbari* (transl. by H. Blochmann) , for various servants and labourers, ranged from 2-4 *dams* or copper currency per day, which equaled 60-120 dams per month, which provides a monthly silver wage of 1.5-3 *Rupiyas* per month, 1 *Rupiya* being 10-11 grams in weight. Therefore, as Allen puts it, the wages in Delhi could *almost* afford the "respectable" basket of goods in England, and by the 18th century, workers in Delhi earned only about 30-40 % of that cost. \n\nB) The EEIC defeated the Portugese off the coast of Surat at the Battle of Swally in 1612 and by 1647, had 23 establishments on the subcontinent. During the 17th century, the balance of economic power shifted from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. Massive inflation had already rendered Spanish manufacturing and agriculture uncompetitive, and the English and the Dutch were the great gainers. With the former beating the latter in the 18th century. The wages in England were higher than those of its continental rival, namely France in the 17th century as well.\n\nC) It should be apparent that England was certainly not a backwater, less dwarfed by the Portuguese or the Spanish. While the Spanish and the French commanded greater forces on land, the English focused on their naval capabilities, which allowed the EEIC to defeat the Portuguese and eventually dominate the trade in the Indian Ocean. In terms of their economic performance, in the period before and during the 17th century, they display a similar dynamism, with the acceptance of newer institutions, such as joint-stock companies. \n\nD) In conclusion, this description of England, here called "Britian" is not accurate to what sources have revealed. \n\n [ Sources :\n\n*Urban Wage Earners in 17th century India*, 2021, p. 301-305, Nishat Manzar\n\n*The Cambridge Economic History of India* 2008, Vol II, p. 378, 464 , GE : Irfan Habib and Tapan Raychaudhuri \n\n*Global Economic History*, 2011, p. 20-21, by Robert C Allen \n\n*The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War* by Robert C. Allen, Nuffield College, Oxford OXI INF, Explorations in Economic History\n\n*The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective*, 2012, p. 33-44 by Robert C. Allen ] \n\n\n\n**05:58 T0 06:08**\n\n&gt;India was ruled at the time by the Mughal Empire... Beginning with Emperor Babur in 1525, they established a near complete rule over the subcontinent by 1600\n\nThis simply did not happen. Anyone needs to do little more than inspect a map of the subcontinent from the period. Akbar\'s Empire included the southernmost provinces of Khandesh and Berar, both of which did not extend any further than modern day Maharashtra. \n\n\n**06:12 TO 06:15**\n\n&gt;The Mughal Empire determined the lives of 180 million people or roughly 20 of the world\'s population at the time\n\nTo quote Habib, *It would obviously be foolish to feel certain about any estimate of Indian population for 1600, with the data we have. But it does seem that the balance of probability lies in favour of estimates that place it between 140-150 million*\n\n[ Source : *The Cambridge Economic History of India* 2008, Vol II, p. 166 , GE : Irfan Habib and Tapan Raychaudhuri ] \n\n\n\n**06:20 TO 06:50**\n\n&gt;Maintained huge armies made up of 100,000s of soldiers with anything equivalent not being seen in Europe until the 19th century. Their soldiers were armed with the latest flintlock muskets muzzleloading cannons.... also made use of a sophisticated administrative structure that drew power and wealth from land revenues and through this structure even petty nobles enjoyed a lifestyle many more times luxurious than the English monarch\n\nThe theoretical potential of the strength of the Mughal Army could be, 911,400 cavalry and infantry, however such a force was never manifested at any point of time throughout the Mughal period. According to the the *Ain-i-Akbari*, Akbar maintained only 12,000 cavalry and 12,000 matchlockmen, these men being known as *Ahadis*. This number fell to 7000 under Shah Jahan. In 1647 and 1650, Mughal field armies numbered only 47,000 soldiers and 50,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry respectively. It\'s a fantastical suggestion, that the Mughals "maintained" armies of 100,000s, since the organisation of the Empire, meant that 82% of the revenues was earmarked for the military/beaurocracy namely *Mansabdars*, who in turn maintained their obligated numbers of soldiers. Furthermore, the flintlock were unknown to the Mughal infantry. These and their cavalry counterparts, would be armed with matchlocks almost exclusively, with the exceptional rarity of wheel-locks, however, flintlocks would not be used by infantrymen raised by the kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent, until well into the 18th century. \n\n[ Sources :\n\nRoy, Kaushik. *Military Manpower, Armies and Warfare in South Asia*, 2013, p. 65\n\nGommans, Jos. *Mughal Warfare, Indian Frontiers and High Roads to Empire, 1500-1700*, 2002, p. 154-156\n\nIrvine, William. *The Army of the Indian Moghuls : Its Organisation and Administration*, 1903, p. 103, 105 ] \n\n\n\n**07:16 TO 07:20**\n\n&gt;True the Mughals never tried to expand their empire overseas but why leave home when you\'ve already got all the goods? \n\nIt would be the incompetence of the Mughal Empire in the ocean which proved detrimental to their trade interests and therefore made them beholden to trading companies. Goods, require means of transport and these cargo ships, require protection. The inability to protect their own shipment, allowed traders and companies to gain leverage over the Mughals. \n\n\n\n**07:30 TO 07:42**\n\n&gt;desperation for indian commodities like pearls gems spices silks and manufactured cloth. The early European trading posts in india weren\'t signs of Mughal weakness but signals of strength\n\nAs noted above, the Mughal policy to allow these posts to be maintained, was a decision borne out of necessity and the inability to secure trade in their own waters. \n\n\n\n**08:00 TO 08:15**\n\n&gt;of all of these pitiful European traders begging the Mughals for access to their markets, the English at the time were unquestionably the most pathetic of the bunch\n\nSir Thomas Roe, who first met the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, described himslef as a "man of quality". It must be understood, that he held himself and his King\'s honour and that of his society in high esteem, a sense of moral superiority based around class consciousness. He was detached from the Company "factors" like Hawkins, and chose to conduct himself with dignity, class and etiquette. He was least impressed with Mughal officials, troops or indeed Jahangir\'s subordinates. Jahangir himself "had never used any ambassador with so much respect". It should be noted that the conduct of the English ambassador was one which exemplified a public servant, on duty, who sought treaty with a foreign monarch. There was no "begging" involved in this process and after 3 long years, he failed in securing a desirable treaty. This however, would not be a stain on his record as a successor was not sought and he did secure the right to build a factory at Surat. \n\n[ Sources :\n\nDalrymple, William *The Anarchy*, 2019\n\nKeay, John *The Honourable Company*, 1991 ]\n\n\nWith this, my critique comes to an end.

      <li>Title::: '[HELP] What should I do in this situation? Please help me.'<br />Body: "Hi everyone. Please read and help me, I have HUGE TROUBLE. I recently post on the various subreddits seeking advice for certain issues in my life. So basically, I am a disabled person. I have made several posts in the past related to that but I didn't know about the exact name of disability but only symptoms that I face. But in recent times, someone said something personal to me and I looked up the name of my disability on the internet **(for the first time in my life).** And found out that I am not just physical disability but have huge learning problems which make me difficult to understand maths, logic, abstract ideas etc. I also suffer from executive function, ADHD, behaviour disorders and have lower maturity level than many of my peers.\n\nThe thing is I have done some study which I thought might be another below average kid in the class. I got admission into colleges due to reservations. Now, again for the first time, I have made appearance with non-familiar people (non-family or friends) and I realised even kids far below my age had more intelligence than me. ALL of affairs were/are still managed by my family so I never did any chores nor did I ever stepped out of the house alone.\n\nQuestion is: As I did study from good colleges but was unable to grab job (never thought why). Now, for first time, got out and face non-familiar people which made me releasie that I have very very lower IQ, maturity, behaviour than others. I always had issues delayed development issues (if I look back now), but neither me or my family took them seriously.\n\nNow, my family expects (I was also until few months ago), to be sitted on reputable position and earn livilihood for myself and family. But I released that my recent released thing that I might be just a child (12-13 years old) in the body of adult. Family took care of me like 3-5 years old baby and my brain is not mature enough for outside world.\n\nThis is putting HUGEEEEE pressure on me lately after the releasation that parents are expecting a lot from me, and me being a child-brain might not be able to achieve those things.\n\nI have trouble tieing laces, combing hair, counting notes faster, not able to brush until class 7 etc. After the releasation that I might not be normal, mentally (not just physically, as me and my parents believed till now) as well. I told my parents about how I feel recently, and certain examples from the past where I had trouble doing mental tasks. But they brushed it off saying you studied from good college so be confident and ignore the other these things. But from last week or so. I have panic attacks that I have wasted so many years of my life, my parents and mine expectations of being productive member of society and now I might be just a decoration in the house (if my parents allowed me to stay in). Where will I go? How will I be able to afford food for life (if parents did not throw me out but their resources also dry up to provide food). What will I do being bedridden, mentally ill? I told my parents that I want an evaluation from a doctor about how I feel and to see if I have some neurological issues or not but they ignored me?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? VERY SERIOUS. PLEASE."<br />Author: 'takojatesla'  id: 'rerg7u'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rerg7u/help_what_should_i_do_in_this_situation_please/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Suraj Yengde whom Honorable Justice Chandrachud was promoting a week back claims that in 400CE, there was no Hinduism in India, but there was Mohamammedism in Indian Express article.'<br />Body: 'Thus, a Buddhist monk from China, Fa-Hien, decided to come to the land of the Buddha in 399/400 CE. Authorised by the Han dynasty, Fa-Hien, he took the difficult journey while recording the experiences of a flourishing Buddhism from Central Asia to South Asia. Fa-Hien reported with great detail all the Buddhist sites and symbols that he encountered. Fourteen hundred years later, Alexander Cunningham, the father of India‚Äôs archaeology, followed Fa-Hien‚Äôs trails to uncover the sites.\n\nFa-Hien reported with details how the Buddhist kingdoms venerated the Buddha. Fa-Hien also wrote about the important moments in Buddhist history.\n\nBuddhism was a State religion across the plains of India. Kings vied to make offerings and patronise monasteries. The places Buddha visited were revered.\n\nThe information Fa-Hien documents is crisp, yet has detailed precision. Fa-Hien learned new languages and transcribed alien cultures filled with Buddhist lores.\n\nThe purpose of Fa-Hien‚Äôs travels to the Buddha‚Äôs lands was to take with him the Vinaya-Pitika ‚Äî the code for good governance. That is why his travelogue became known as ‚ÄúA Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms‚Äù, translated from old Chinese to modern English by Scotsman James Legge in 1886.\n\n\n\nLegge identifies the existing religious beliefs at the time of translation, as Christianity, Confucianism, Brahmanism, Mohammedanism and Taoism. Notably, there is no mention of Hinduism because there didn‚Äôt exist a faith as such.\n\nFa-Hien notes of Brahmins as jealous and angry people who believed in a ‚Äúfalse doctrine‚Äù that was contrary to the Buddhas. Brahmins attempted to root out any evidence of Buddhist past by cutting down the trees which were believed to be planted by the Buddha. He also notes meticulously how a ‚Äúheretical Brahmin‚Äù went to the limits of murdering a woman so as to put the blame on the Buddha.\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/fa-hien-in-land-of-buddha-7668321/'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'reklsd'<br />Score:66<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/reklsd/suraj_yengde_whom_honorable_justice_chandrachud/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Olaf Cholz becomes Chancellor of Germany, Suu Kyi convicted in Myanmar, and fake democracy in Communist dictatorships'<br />Body: '***For all my previous posts in the Geopolitics Thread, see*** [***ididacannonball\'s Corner***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/ididacannonballcorner)\n\nWelcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [New German Chancellor takes charge](https://apnews.com/article/climate-elections-europe-angela-merkel-european-union-675ee26e99ce6e7f57d0f61989b05a16)\n\nAfter months of negotiations, the largest parties from Germany\'s last federal election came together to elect a new Chancellor. Olaf Scholz, who served as Germany\'s vice chancellor and finance minister since 2018, took over as the head of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Green Part, and the pro-business Free Democrats. This puts outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel\'s party firmly in the opposition after 16 years of being in power. The new chancellor has promised continuity in foreign policy, but plans to be more aggressive on climate change as well as legalizing marijuana in the country.\n\n2. [Tensions rise on Ukraine-Russia border](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/europe/ukraine-russia-boosts-troops-intl/index.html)\n\nTensions in eastern Europe rose further as Ukraine accused Russia of amassing 1.2 lakh soldiers at its borders in preparation for a winter invasion of the country. Russia on the other hand accuses Ukraine of scare mongering while insisting that the country not be admitted into NATO. Following his visit to New Delhi, Russian President Putin held a virtual discussion with US President Biden, where the latter is understood to have threatened to drop Russian banks from the SWIFT inter-banking transfer system in case of an invasion of Ukraine. Separately, the G7 held discussions and tried to present a united front, although deep divisions remain over the extent of retaliatory measures that can be taken.\n\n3. [Iran talks reach impasse in Vienna](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/11/iran-and-world-powers-try-to-bridge-gaps-in-ongoing-vienna-talks)\n\nTalks continued in Vienna to restore the Iran nuclear accord. Iran joined other signatories - the P5 + Germany - to discuss a way forward to lift sanctions on the country. The nuclear accord, which was signed during the tenure of former presidents Obama and Rouhani of the US and Iran respectively, fell apart when former US president Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and imposed tough sanctions that have left Iran\'s economy in a downward spiral. Now the parties are trying to patch it back together, but negotiations remain at an impasse as Iran\'s new hardline president Ebrahim Raisi seeks even more concessions than the original deal. Israel has vociferously opposed the negotiations.\n\n4. [Nicaragua recognizes PRC, cuts ties with Taiwan](https://news.yahoo.com/honduras-next-government-maintain-taiwan-172731347.html)\n\nThe central American country of Nicaragua dropped diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognized China instead, in a familiar dance among a few small countries. The vast majority of the world recognizes the PRC and accepts its One China principle, in which Taiwan is considered to be a part of China. But a few countries, mainly Pacific Island states as well as some central and south American countries, recognize Taiwan. They usually receive significant aid in return for this, and often even switch allegiances to extract more aid from either side. This is what the Nicaraguan President Ortega is believed to be doing - after his shambolic election victory and the threat of sanctions from the US, he appears to be embracing China as a way to offset those sanctions and shore up his country\'s economy.\n\n5. [Myanmar Kangaroo court convicts Suu Kyi](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-elections-voting-myanmar-986be24c558b54c6ebdb20aa272657ca)\n\nA Kangaroo court trying ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi for trumped up charges convicted her of inciting violence and breaking coronavirus restrictions. She was sentenced to four years in jail, a sentence that was immediately reduced to two by the country\'s military dictatorship. This is just the first in a whole series of fake cases that the generals have thrown at her, even as they clamp down heavily on any threats to their dictatorship. Peaceful protests broke out in the country\'s cities, including Mandalay, where a non-violent strike was observed. Separately, the US imposed further sanctions on the Burmese junta, and Facebook banned all commercial companies associated with the regime from its platforms.\n\n# Geopolitical History: Democracy in a Communist dictatorship\n\nThis past week, US President Joe Biden hosted the Summit for Democracy, an international conference aimed to shore up democracy in the world. In many ways, this is a domestic show partly to show that Biden is doing "something" against the authoritarian regimes in China and Russia and partly to put down Donald Trump\'s (false) allegations that Biden is an illegitimate and undemocratic president. But China reacted surprisingly forcefully against the Summit, to which it was of course not invited. The CCP released a white paper, describing China as a flourishing, multi-party democracy where everyone lived in happiness and love. Aside from the obvious hyperbole, since when does China have multiple parties? \n\nBelieve it or not, most Communist dictatorships in the past and present hold elections. Of course, unlike democracies, the purpose of those elections is not to select a leadership or an ideology to run a country, rather is it purely an exercise in optics to show the rest of the world that the regime actually enjoys popular support - and the regime always, always wins. The big daddy of them all, the Soviet Union, had universal suffrage with secret ballots enshrined in its constitution. The elections were for a body called the Supreme Soviet as well as other legislative bodies that had no say whatsoever in the running of the country, but provided platforms where the Communist leadership could rubber-stamp decisions that were already made. There were no parties save the CPSU, so the ballot actually had just one candidate selected by the party, and voters could vote for or against that candidate. In theory, a candidate who received less than 50% of the vote could be replaced by the CPSU, but in practice the candidate\'s network and connections mattered more.\n\nSimilarly, North Korea holds regular elections for the Supreme People\'s Assembly, but it\'s one step ahead of the USSR. North Korea has three political parties that are part of a coalition called the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland - the largest being the Workers Party of Korea which the Kim clan leads, followed by the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party. These parties go back to the chaos of WW2 and the Korean War, when multiple Communist parties fought nationalists, the UN, and each other for control. The Front jointly proposes a candidate in a constituency and voters, like in the USSR, can vote for or against the candidate. However, the system is unique: voters who want to vote "for" simply pick up a ballot and drop it into a box, while those that vote against have to walk behind a screen and mark their ballot. Given that the Workers Party controls the election system, the leadership will quickly know who voted against them. No wonder then that North Korean elections have 100% voter turnout with the Front winning 100% of seats in the SPA.\n\nWhich brings us to the PRC. China actually has *eight* legal political parties, of which the CCP is the largest. These are - the CCP, the Jiusan Society, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Workers and Peasants Democratic Party, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Zhi Gong Party, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Lots of "democratic" parties, but like North Korea, they are part of a single coalition called the United Front, which presents a single candidate in each constituency, wins all the seats, and controls 100% of the seats in the rubber-stamp National People\'s Congress. These parties are the remnants of the chaos of WW2 and the Japanese occupation, in fact the Kuomintang is the communist wing of the Nationalist party that was defeated in the Chinese Civil War and fled to Taiwan. All of these parties accept the CCP\'s domination and its ideology, the so-called Socialism with Chinese characteristics. The only exceptions are the Kuomintang and the Taiwan League, which also focus on bringing Taiwan into the fold. But China does one thing with the United Front that neither the USSR did nor the DPRK does - it uses them as legal fronts in other countries, for example as "societies" where overseas Chinese students can join as members and thus be monitored. This difference comes from the fact that while the USSR and DPRK were barely integrated with the world, the PRC is everywhere. For example, the Jiusan ("nine-three", referring to Sep 3, 1944, when China defeated Japan in WW2) Society is a communist party of mostly scientists and intellectuals, and is a key front for coordinating the theft of IP from labs in the West.\n\nSo next time you go to a booth to cast a vote in an Indian election, take a look at the giant list of candidates that you are presented with. In the eyes of the CCP, this is a circus and their theatrical show is democracy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have any questions about geopolitics? Want to share an interesting story?

      <li>Title::: 'Am I paranoid or is there any hope?'<br />Body: 'Namaskaarams to all. Lately I\'ve been noticing a spike towards Hindu intolerance. The way Wasim Rizvi is treated, Gurugram situation, openly laughing in fb posts at Late Gen. Shri Bipin Rawat\'s demise (Om Shanthi). Although the last one is out of sheer spite, in the rest of these situations, it would seem as if being a Hindu would be impossible in the next 30 odd years. At first, it started as "Well they\'re very marginal in number, so we have to be kind to them" which I personally think is stupid because, just try and be nice to everyone as much as possible. What does it matter if that person is from a minority group or marginalized group? Be nice to the individual and that would result in being nice to everyone altogether. I think the sovereignty of a Hindu as an individual is at stake because if I as a Hindu say "Why would you want to do namaz in public space and as a result hindering others?", I\'d be branded as an Islamophobic first by the media, then by other hindus who don\'t understand my perspective. There\'s been a well thought out, systematic dismantling of every aspect of Hinduism in a lot of ways, through mass media, entertainment, political schemes and so on for the past century and a half that there\'s political leaders claiming that Hindus are obscene, porn worshipping idiots on stage (prevalent in TN).\n\nWhat\'s our recourse? I believe that everyone should be able to practice their faith in a way that doesn\'t involve troubling/demonizing others who practice different faiths and yet, in my opinion, there seems to be an understanding among a lot of Christians and Muslims when it comes to destroying Hinduism and its legacy by playing the victim game (because if you convince others that you are the victim, you can also convince them that the victimizer deserves to be destroyed). I pray the Almighty to guide me and anyone else facing this ethical dilemma because as hindus, Bharatha bhoomi is our punya bhoomi. This doesn\'t mean that there\'s no place for other faiths but, it means that in the name of hospitality and tolerance, we\'ve been convinced that we are victimzers and oppressors and in order to continue this wonderful legacy that has been given to us, we need to assert our boundaries in the sense that our faith is not a sacrifice to promote others\'.\n\nI cannot talk about this with my friends as I\'d be branded as paranoid and ridiculed. If it\'s menat to be ridiculed, so be it. But I sincerely am afraid of this incredibly tactical strike in our culture that in the forseeable future, our temples, and the ones who maintain them would be wiped out for good as one of the things that has been happening since independence is the increased attack on those communities that undertake temple seva because if you destroy them, you destroy the temples and if you destroy the temples, you destroy hinduism.\n\nAgain, this is not to say that hinduism is perfect, it has its flaws. A particular community in charge of the temple is something that I\'d always stand against but at the same time, you cannot allow anyone and everyone to do something that they are not trained in the mind to do. It\'s like any sport in my opinion. Almost all of those who play for our country have had physical and mental training right from their childhood. I love cricket but, that doesn\'t mean I could represent my local district let alone my country without the proper training and preparation.\n\nTL DR: I\'m afraid that Hinduism would be destroyed before we realize it\'s too late by these media and political groups that have systematically and surgically destroyed a lot of this culture\'s legacy.

I have a few things to discuss , might add more later.\n\n1- more active moderation: will talk about this later.\n\n\n2- obvious troll or satire accounts : the Indian right has a very bad habit of confusing troll accounts with actual ones. For instance , there are a few people who obviously are troll accounts cracking jews bad bro or some random conspiracy shit in the name of rw and often reach hot . These people are shitty casteist who also crack homophobic jokes, these type of people must be banned and stopped. They are whackish idiots who are probably trolling and if not then are just plain idiots. And another thing is that these troll accounts also can be the ones who make a hate comment first and then post a screenshot about the same comment on an anti hate sub just to make this sub look bad.\n\n\n3- Islamophobia and hate - this is a very controversial topic. First of all , I am against jehad but we must also remember not 2 be Islamophobic. Educating urself against jehad is one thing and straight forwardly spreading hate is another thing. There are a few people who I think are mostly trolls but if not, are very hate-filled . They comment nonsense like kill all of them or kick them out of the nation and other stuff which is very bad. Saying that a Muslims are bad is a very wrong and generalised statement. There are many indian Muslims who are very patriotic. Many of the true Indian Muslims are members of RSS, we must remember not to spread hate . I stand against jihad and the jihadi but saying stuff like all muslims bad is very wrong. We must speak against the ideology but not be Islamophobic or just hate all of the muslims. In general I think that speaking positively about violence or hate against any community or religion, be it from any wing is very wrong and it just puts us in a bad light. Face it , without friendly relations and unity between Indians, we might not win back pok and the regions that china is illegally occupying. Speak against jihad and the jihadi but don't do some hateful it whacky stuff ( recently a video went viral with some guy saying that if muslims are not kicked out he will take jal samdhi , this stuff is outrageous and also wrong . And it's also mostly spread by trolls or just elements of the society who are just plain bloodthirsty, these elements must not be entertained) \n\n\n4 - Self loathe - again  there r a few accounts , mostly troll who say some random casteist stuff or just mock other dharmiks /Indians (which is against the fundamental idea of hindutva, unifying sanatanis from all castes and  parts of  the nation), a few of them mock south indians and a few of them mock the hindi states , this stuff is mostly spread by commies and there are a few self loathing commies in this sub too.(they just exist on reddit without discrimination, like seriously go to any major political  subreddit Indian or American , left or right, and u will find at least some self loathe over there) this must not be entertained. \n\n\nFinally I would say that most of the people who do the above are obvious trolls n we need to ban these people, not only this subreddit but all the Indians rw subs and we must also remember to be courageous and not spread hate against anyone. We must speak up but not generalise."<br />Author: 'RegisterCompetitive1'  id: 'rd7yys'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rd7yys/opinion/</li>

Once they went down, they were asked to remove their car. I wasn't at the scene but my driver claims he was threatened. One policeman apparently snatched the car keys and threatened him. When I did get there, I overheard a gentleman asking them where he was supposed to park instead and they told him the road.    \n   \nNow I know that the road there is a no parking zone, I've seen cars get towed from there. So I asked my driver to go further away and find parking somewhere. Most of the people had driven their own cars there, they couldn't do that. They had to park on the road.      \n     \nWhen our car was idling waiting for my father(he had an operation) to come down, a taxi driver told us to move away because the police were coming our way and spiking the wheels of every car on the road.          \n                \nI know my country is corrupt, I know this isn't the first world. I have low expectations. But honestly this is the first time I've seen such blatant corruption, and that too at a target like a hospital. If I didn't have a driver, I'd have had to call a cab to get my father home, after he was operated on then go sort out whatever mess the police would make with the car. This was their intention. And they can be so brazen about it they announced it on the PA. Leave hundreds of witnesses while running an extortion racket.     \n    \nLike half the people never responded and their cars weren't touched. But the ones who did listen to the police, theirs got towed.   \n    \nThis happened today, 10th December."<br />Author: 'Sasanka_Of_Gauda'  id: 'rd7mt3'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rd7mt3/psa_for_kolkatanons_bidhannagar_police_is_running/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bollywood cashes in on foreign subsidies, cut production cost | Published: 2012'<br />Body: 'You might have been mesmerised by Prague after watching it in Bollywood flick Rockstar or by the bylanes of Berlin in Don 2. Most tourism boards are increasingly pitching for locations to producers and directors in India by offering subsidies, which can bear almost 40 per cent cost of a film.\n\n‚ÄúThese incentives range from tax rebate, free stays, visa facilitation, and in certain cases, they even bear the cost of production. Cashing on the foreign government subsidies, production houses are now trying to film in exotic locales and in some cases, even alter the script to avail of this,‚Äù says Karan Arora, co-founder and chief executive, High Ground Enterprise, which deals in film production and does consultancy work with foreign governments on these issues.\n\nEros International has already scheduled the shooting of its two films in Fiji. The Fiji government recently announced it would offer 47 per cent of the production cost for films being shot there. ‚Äú3G, staring Neil Nitin Mukesh and Sonal Chauhan, has already gone on floor. It‚Äôs a psychological thriller that revolves around the 3G spectrum scandal,‚Äù said an official from Eros.\n\nTourism boards of many countries, such as Switzerland and UK, have offered benefits but the trend has taken off in a big way now. Aditya Chopra‚Äôs Ek Tha Tiger, starring Salman Khan, will be shot in five different countries, including Ireland and South Africa, while Housefull 2 was shot in Thailand and Imran Khan starrer Ek Main Aur Ek Tu was shot in the USA.\n\nAccording to industry officials, Don 2, which was filmed in Germany, got subsidy between Rs 20-25 crore from the German government, Ra.One got a subsidy of Rs 30 crore and Desi Boyz got about Rs 5 crore as subsidy from the UK government.\n\nTrade analysts agree it works out cheaper to take the cast and crew to foreign locations. The entire film is completed in a single schedule.\n\nMost countries offer tax sops in the form of VAT refund, 10-20 per cent, depending on the location and the amount of budget spent on the location. South Africa gives 30 per cent and Australia offers about 40 per cent, with additional incentives from individual states like Queensland. The French government has set up Film France to attract international film shoots and it offers incentives such as refund of VAT on shoots by foreign film crews. New Zealand inked a co-production treaty with India in June 2011 in an attempt to gain from the Bollywood market, after realising the benefits derived from various Bollywood films shot there.\n\nFurther, Spain and India are close to signing an agreement that would facilitate and promote co-productions. ‚ÄúWe offer up to 20 per cent rebate to filmmakers on their payments, to both individuals and companies,‚Äù said Radka Neumannova, India director of Czech Tourism, as she stresses on the need to make the Czech Republic visible through Bollywood films.\n\nAll this is a small price to pay for the huge benefits that accrue from it. Countries are realising what films can do as they showcase their locations as per the script, which in turn lead to tourist inflow in those countries.\n\nAfter Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the influx of Indian tourists to Spain increased to 32 per cent. ‚ÄúTo turn this into an advantage, to increase the number of tourists and to keep the destinations‚Äô name alive through continuous promotion, depends on many other factors. It is a great way to promote the country as movies are the most important form of entertainment in India. It strikes a chord with the movie buffs depending on how the location is featured in the movie,‚Äù Rakesh Jariwala, partner and segment champion (film entertainment), Ernst &amp; Young.\n\n[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20210125043022/https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/bollywood-cashes-in-on-foreign-subsidies-cut-production-cost-112051400021_1.html)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'rd0a9r'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rd0a9r/bollywood_cashes_in_on_foreign_subsidies_cut/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'BJP will quite possibly never win in Assam again.'<br />Body: "\nHindu population in Assam has declined from 70.78% in 1951 to 61.47% in 2011. Whereas in 1891, the Muslim population in Assam was only about 5%, by the 2001 census it had risen to above 30% and by 2011 to above 34% of the total Assam population.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, there were six Muslim-majority districts in Assam, increasing to nine by the time of the 2011 census. The districts are Dhubri, Goalpara, Barpeta, Morigaon, Nagaon, Karimganj, Hailakandi, Darrang and Bongaigaon (Almost all border Districts with Bangladesh)\n\nAccording to 2021 estimates Muslims are 40.3 percent of the total population of Assam. And they show no sign of stopping, with Assamese Muslim Leaders Making statements like this- \n\n&gt;Muslims will continue to produce more children:\xa0Assam MP Badruddin Ajmal\xa0on\xa0two-child policy\n\nhttps://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/oct/28/muslims-will-continue-to-produce-more-children-assam-mp-badruddin-ajmal-on-two-child-policy-2053727.amp\n\n\n\nOf the 79 total seats in Assam, 28 are Muslim-dominated. In 2016, the BJP won just three of these 28 seats. In 14 seats, the Hindu and Muslim populations are almost equal.\xa0\n\n\nThe number of children who would be born per woman ‚Äî or the total fertility rate (TFR) ‚Äî of the Muslim community in Assam is at 2.4 which is higher than the 1.6 for Hindus as of 2019-20 research by the fifth\xa0National Family Health Survey. This is a significant gap, and will result in the percentage of Hindus declining even more in coming decades. \n\n https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/can-bjp-survive-the-demographic-disadvantage-in-assam-1784851-2021-03-29\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Assam#Population\n\nIt's over for Hindus there. Muslims are expected to become a Majority in Assam within 2-3 decades. BJP has 0 chance of coming to power ina a state that 50 percent Muslim, so Hemant Biswas is quite possibly the last Hindu Assamese Chief Minister. \n\nSo sad to see that a place which has 95 percent Non Muslims 100 years ago, will be soon 50 percent Muslim. The Assamese people have lost their culture, and will soon lose their own state to outsiders. \n\nTheir fate must be a lesson to all of us.

It‚Äôs an iconic road by itself - wide, spacious and lined by old trees on either sides, their wide branches canopying the road beneath.\n\nAt the first look, the road does not look special. It‚Äôs a normal tar road, 1.5 kilometer long and wide, considering it handles a lot of traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[That's a 40 year old road!](https://preview.redd.it/mokjyzseij481.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cbc5977296c95ec6d61508475357f0c8623867a)\n\n# But it is a case study in most civil engineering departments in the city because it has not seen a single pothole in the past 40 years. Forget about potholes, there has been no repair work or maintenance work done on it, because it was never ever needed!\n\nIt‚Äôs an incredible phenomenon, especially when you take the regular roads into account and how contractors make them substandard so that they can keep billing the municipal corporation for repair and maintenance work every couple of years. Every Indian knows this. A road is built and one rainy season later, it is riddled with potholes. The contractor smiles and comes back to fix it, billing the local municipality and the corporator who awarded the contract takes a cut from the money allotted. The repair work is purposely done shoddily so as to keep milking the taxpayer until they are fat rich.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the story of Jangli Maharaj Road is quite different. Back in the 1970s, the road was a mess, just like any other road in India. In 1972, the monsoon was especially torrential and the road suffered. \n\nThe then **21-year-young PMC corporator Shrikant Shirole** somehow convinced his peers in the standing committee that they should build a road that will last more than a few years, since the traffic will increase in the subsequent years. His colleagues assented and Shirole set out to Mumbai to look for contractors since Mumbai roads were built to last.\n\nShirole finally selected two Parsi brothers who owned a contracting company in Panvel. They finally agreed and went about and constructed the road in record time.\n\n# The contractors gave Pune city a guarantee of 10 years. 10 years and there will be no issue with the road. No potholes, no cracks, no maintenance issues after monsoons. Nothing. \n\nShirole and Pune city waited and still wait for the road to show some blemishes. It has been over 40 years and it is still going strong. \n\n**It is to be noted that PMC did not float a tender to select a contractor on Shirole‚Äôs insistence.** He predicted that the tender process itself was corrupted. It is best to select a quality contractor and pay him the money instead.\n\nThat‚Äôs what they did and look how beautiful it looks even today. It‚Äôs a tarred road. No fancy Reinforced Cement Concrete either. Just plain tar and using the latest methods of civil engineering and applying it to the road while building it. \n\n# There is a sad ending to this ‚Äì \n\nApparently, **the contractors were blacklisted by the PMC** after they built the road, because the local contractors felt that it would set a dangerous precedent where they might actually have to do sincere work. The contractors never built a road in Pune ever again. This is emphasised in civil engineering classes in Pune engineering colleges, cautioning engineers to not be a hundred percent honest because it might cost them their jobs.\n\nI hope, with the change of scenery at the centre, we might start seeing roads built like this again, all over India where the contractor‚Äôs word of guarantee is indeed gold.\n\nThat‚Äôs it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources ‚Äì \n\nHow 21 year old corporator set out to do the right thing - \n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-city-jangli-maharaj-road-7502639/](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-city-jangli-maharaj-road-7502639/)\n\nPolitically, culturally and aesthetically relevant JM Road ‚Äì\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/punes-j-m-road-to-sport-new-look-in-a-months-time/articleshow/28451646.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/punes-j-m-road-to-sport-new-look-in-a-months-time/articleshow/28451646.cms)"<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'rckqvg'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rckqvg/the_incredible_story_of_jangli_maharaj_road_in/</li>

Former Brahmos chief A Sivathanu Pillai writes in his book ‚ÄòThe Path Unexplored‚Äô that army commanders tried their best to sabotage the Brahmos cruise missile - India\'s most successful weapon. (He doesn\'t name them but it\'s the Chandigarh Gang) \n\n&gt;2. Pillai reveals that these senior military commanders wanted to scuttle the BrahMos project by declaring its performance unsatisfactory. Their plan was to continue India‚Äôs dependency on imports, which would result in more kickbacks for middlemen. \n\n&gt;3. The Chandigarh Gang is not exclusively based in Chandigarh, but is only centered there. Its elements exist in different parts of the country. Army chief General VK Singh broke the back of the Chandigarh Gang, but it continues to survive. \n\n&gt;4. General Rawat was known to be incorruptible. He was implementing Narendra Modi\'s Atmanirbhar India project in the defence services. Today, many sectors are now off limits to importers. The loss to the import lobby must be to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees.\n \n&gt;5. It\'s convenient to blame China or Pakistan, but looking within us is the hardest thing to do. No country, with the exception of Pakistan, has more internal enemies and saboteurs than India. Unfortunately, this is the one angle that will never be revealed.\n\nEnds \n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1468883561688141824.html'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'rck8x7'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rck8x7/chandigarh_lobby_saw_many_people_talking_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'War with China will break out soon'<br />Body: "I have a strong feeling war will break out soon. China's cyber offensive capabilities are superior or at least on par with the US, they can even hijack their enemy's missile command centres and make them fire at their own troops. This is not fear mongering, it's reality. First, the ambush in Manipur. It was reported the Chinese had a [hand] (https://www.northeasttoday.in/2021/11/15/manipur-ambush-showcases-chinas-possible-support-to-northeast-insurgent-outfits/) in the deaths of the Major and his family. This was done to provoke us and force our hand. When India did not respond the next step was to boost anti-India sentiment with the civilian killings in Nagaland. According to army insiders, a counterintel plan on the part of the rebels involved leaking information to the SF. When they setup the ambush they didn't expect civilians to arrive in the place of militants. After the tragic killings now there is fear and hatred. The riots in Tripura also had a Pakistani hand. If China launches a military invasion of Arunachal Pradesh and the rest of the northeast they can expect a population conducive to occupation. Hatred of India based on real, historic and imagined grievances, has never been higher in the northeast. \n\nWar may be initiated by either side but if India doesn't take the bait China will fire the opening salvo. The numerous airbases in Tibet (at least 10 have been constructed in the past 1 year) are a terrifying reminder of impending air raids followed by the ground invasion that is sure to follow. Stock up on supplies and keep the morale up. It doesn't matter if you live far from the border, China can take out our power stations like they did in Mumbai in October 2020. No power means no logistics which means no supplies which means no food. China warned its citizens to stock up on food and essentials about one month back. India still can win this war and we need to do our part. India's cyber offensive capabilities are not on the same level as the Chinese, but it's still quite strong. Our military is capable of resisting the enemy and inflicting heavy damage on those who violate our borders. Do not believe the Pakistani trolls pretending to be Christians/Sikhs/Muslims celebrating the tragedy. There may be genuine anti-nationals in our country but remember, every time we turn on each other the enemy wins. Stay united and stay strong.

      <li>Title::: 'Should India join the diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics?'<br />Body: "As some of you may know, the Winter Olympics are going to be held in Beijing this year. Yes, the Summer Olympics just happened in Tokyo but forget about that. \n\nThe US has launched a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics, ostensibly to protest against the concentration camps that the CCP is running in Xinjiang. This means that while US athletes will be able to compete, no US government officials will be part of the official ceremonies (note that in every country including India, the country's Olympic Committee is an independent, non-government organization, even if it gets government grants). Today, the UK, Australia, and Canada announced similar diplomatic boycotts for the same reason. China has naturally denounced the boycott and threatened unspecified retaliation against the US and the countries. \n\nNow, let's be clear, this is not about the poor Muslims of Xinjiang, nobody cares about them. This is great power politics at play - I seriously doubt the US would be boycotting the Winter Olympics in Saudi Arabia (and before you ask - Beijing doesn't have natural snow either and intends to generate artificial snow for the event). And KSA's human rights record is there for all to see. This is part of the asymmetric warfare against China to contain its rise. \n\nIndia actually has much more serious disagreements with China: support for insurgents, occupation of territory, military aggression, construction in PoK and general support for Pak, etc. Should we join this diplomatic boycott for those reasons? Would this put pressure on China to talk and settle the issues in Ladakh and elsewhere, at least to restore status quo ante?

The moment I open my notes I zone out and by the time I snap out I've wasted hours. I keep thinking about everything except what is needed. I can't even focus during my exam. I wasted half an hour of my math paper thinking about a random physics problem that came in my head. I stay up till 5:00 AM sometimes because I keep thinking about random things, some random problem, imagining something, fantasizing about being a superhero like I'm 5. Sometimes I have a conversation with an imaginary person for hours.  I change obsessions constantly. It's disheartening because I know whatever hobby I pick up will probably be dumped and will never be touched again. These consume my thoughts. It's random. Physics, astronomy, math, computer science, criminal psychology, history. I can laser focus on my obsession for 10+ hours a day for multiple months and they consume my thoughts.\n\nSocially I'm bad. I can't even buy groceries without looking like an idiot. I always do something award, over explain, and just seem really out of place. Normal conversation seems like torture, I can't make eye contact, and don't even have a personality. It's agonizing to think about every muscle I need to pull just to seem like  normal human with facial expressions.\n\nI've tried many things. Meditation, behavior modification, changing environments, changing  schedules, negative reinforcement with a taser, and I'm currently trying taking really doses of caffeine (about 1,000 mg twice a day) and it kinda worked but barely. \n\nI'm sitting in a dark room with music just to stop my mind from wandering off and it's depressing.\n\nI need help.

Might as well tell a cancer patient to stop growing cells. \n\nHow do I convince them? I'm guessing they're afraid of the stigma but it's ruining my life.\n\nAnd worse yet they're always trying to stop me from doing things that can help me manage. I always listen to music just so I can focus but they have issues with that. Imaging the average Indian parents being assholes because I have headphones on all day. My room is usually blacked out because I don't like light as I feel like it's overstimulating and really distracting. They walk in and just open the windows and turn on the lights because only 'rakshass' live in the dark. I have a 'rhythm' and they constantly disturb me.  It's bad enough that they don't really help but they go out of their way to make it worse. They usually counter it by saying shit like 'I grew up in a chawl' and 'other kids can study what's wrong with you'.\n\nI feel defeated.

He was allegedly a victim of a dreaded assassination experiment that caused a brain hemorrhage.\n\n\nOne such senior scientist has even survived a poisoning attempt when his dosa dish was laced. Fortunately the scientist working for the ISRO survived.\n\n\n##India has a history of losing important people to sabotage - \n\nAnd with regards to the government response, it seems that none of the governments want to reveal any foul play it seems. But this is not new. We know for a fact that Subhas Chandra Bose‚Äôs death was not natural and the government itself had admitted that declassifying that information would be detrimental to foreign relations with major ‚Äúallies‚Äù. He is reported to have died in a plane ‚Äúcrash‚Äù too.\n\n\nThen comes the deaths of Dr. Homi Bhabha and Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died of mysterious circumstances when away from the country. No government has attempted to declassify the investigations behind their deaths either. \n\n\nA few years after Homi Bhabha‚Äôs death, Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space program was found dead in his hotel room.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that both Shastri and Bhabha died discussing the possibility of India‚Äôs first underground nuclear test. \n\n\n**It is to be also noted that Jawaharlal Nehru and M K Gandhi were both vehemently against the nuclear bomb and hence India never pursued it.** It was Shastri who wanted India to develop one after 1965 war. And when he flew to Tashkent to sign the armistice with General Ayub Khan of Pakistan, he was dead a day after the signing of the peace treaty.\n\n\nIt does not seem a surprise that a sitting prime minister has been betrayed by the Pakistani counterpart after signing a peace treaty. Vajpayee suffered the same result after coming from Lahore and then there was the Kargil War. Here too a General of the Pakistani Army backstabbed.\n\n\nThere is no question that a foreign hand is at play in the deaths of these esteemed individuals. **The motive is simple ‚Äì to limit the capabilities of India as a space and nuclear power.** The trend is very simple - kill the people who want India to progress forward, be it the leaders or the scientists taking the responsibility in themselves to further India's Nuclear and Space research.\n\n\nThere are multiple reports where foreign entities have meddled with India's capability to develop a cryogenic engine for itself, making deep space missions possible. A report claims that Indian Space Program was set back by a whopping 20 years because of this sabotage. We are still working on perfecting the cryogenic engine.\n\n\nThe Indian Government must make sure that these sleeper agents trying to sabotage India‚Äôs sovereignty by assassinating key personnel must be apprehended and caught and dealt with a critical hand. \n\n\nWe cannot take this lightly anymore.\n\n*Aum Shanti Shanti Shantihi.*\n\n\n\nSources ‚Äì \n\n24 scientists and allied nuclear staff die due to mysterious circumstances - \n\nhttps://www.theweek.in/news/india/2021/01/06/from-the-archives-when-several-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-mysteriously.html\n\n\n11 top nuclear scientists died between 2009 to 2013, as per government data -\n\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/india-news/11-indian-nuclear-scientists-died-unnatural-deaths-in-4-years-1229793\n\n\n684 ISRO staff died in 15 years in this story filed in 2011 ‚Äì\n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/report/isro-mum-on-how-684-of-its-staff-died/20110113.htm\n\n\nA whopping 680 unnatural deaths at BARC - \n\nhttps://asiatimes.com/2019/07/indias-vanishing-nuclear-scientists/\n\n\nGregory Douglas, a journalist claims CIA hand - \n\nhttps://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/unnatural-deaths-1502589589.html\n\n\nSabotaging Indian Space Program's development of a cryogenic engine - \n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/column/who-killed-the-isros-cryogenic-engine/20131118.htm\n\n\nSenior ISRO scientist claims to be poisoned -\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/someone-definitely-wanted-to-harm-isro-scientist-on-claim-of-being-poisoned/story-lcT2c9N3q7beGgWgeDQqKP.html\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0"<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'rbrdmv'<br />Score:246<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rbrdmv/in_light_of_the_recent_accident_involving_the_cds/</li>

However in 2005, he said the progress made by India was incredible. And this article just shows how it is still relevant.\n\nIf LKY was alive today, he would be happy with PM Narendra Modi's leadership.\n\nOf course, there were some pitfalls in PM Modi's tenure as PM but I feel infrastructure wise, India is really catching up.

There is less insistence now on meritocracy by examinations for entrance into top schools and universities, the professions, and the Indian Civil Service.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Lee‚Äôs greatest feelings of [disappointment](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lee-kuan-yew-didnt-dislike-india-he-was-disappointed-by-india/article7023579.ece) toward India was due to its lack of economic progress, ‚Äúbecause it went the wrong way, the socialist way.‚Äù Lee believed that many Indian bureaucrats did not have the right mindset for facilitating economic development, arguing that it was necessary for them to abandon the [idea](http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/03/23/lee-kuan-yews-lessons-for-india-at-a-glance/) that foreigners were ‚Äúout to exploit India and should be hindered.‚Äù Lee‚Äôs [thoughts](https://scroll.in/article/715572/Singapore%27s-Lee-Kuan-Yew-on-why-he-departed-from-Nehruvian-welfarism) on the matter of economic growth for third world countries deserve to be quoted at length here:\n\n \n\n&gt;While\xa0 Lee was disappointed with the direction India took and understood the roots of its underdevelopment, he also grew to be cautiously optimistic about India, especially after its 1991 liberalizing reforms and subsequent growth (though [faulting](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lee-kuan-yew-didnt-dislike-india-he-was-disappointed-by-india/article7023579.ece)) for two decades. Speaking in 2005 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial lecture in New Delhi, he [said](http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lee-kuan-yew-didnt-dislike-india-he-was-disappointed-by-india/article7023579.ece) that ‚ÄúIndia must make up for much time lost. There is in fact already a strong political consensus between India‚Äôs two major parties that India needs to liberalize its economy and engage with the dynamic economies of the world‚Ä¶The time has come for India‚Äôs next tryst with destiny.‚Äù The major reason for this shift, Lee believed, is the [change in mentality](https://scroll.in/article/715572/Singapore%27s-Lee-Kuan-Yew-on-why-he-departed-from-Nehruvian-welfarism) Indians have undergone in the last 20 years: ‚ÄúThere is now no stigma in acquiring wealth. Indians have seen what market orientated policies have done for China and they do not want to be left behind.‚Äù  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lee saw India‚Äôs future as positive, firmly embedded in the story of a rising Asia. Lee [said ](https://scroll.in/article/715572/Singapore%27s-Lee-Kuan-Yew-on-why-he-departed-from-Nehruvian-welfarism)that ‚Äúif there are no mishaps by 2050 the U.S., China, India, and Japan will be economic heavyweights.‚Äù India, seen as a great civilization with an important destiny by both Lee and Nehru, will be an ‚Äúintrinsic part of this unfolding new world order.‚Äù Coming from a man as perceptive as Lee Kuan Yew, this makes the future of India something to look forward to.\n\nI believe we need to have a good opening partnership between Amit Shah and Nirmala ji. India needs to strengthen its internal forces to not disrupt the good economic reforms brought about.\n\nI hope in 2022, the GDP is at $3.5 trillion at least. India has lot of time due to the socialist reforms. The buzz on having semiconductor industry should be made into a reality. \n\nYesterday, I asked one question on who should India trust besides Russia. Indeed, one person wrote correctly, India needs to bank on Singapore. Earlier this year, while defending the CECA agreement between Singapore and India, Minister Ong Ye Kung said this:\n\n&gt; And specifically on CECA, this FTA with India benefits Singapore in many ways. Signed in 2005, it was India‚Äôs first comprehensive bilateral FTA with any country. And CECA gave Singapore a strategic first-mover advantage in India, just when the continental country was taking off to be an economic powerhouse. \n\nWith the recent development projects in modernizing India and boosting infrastructure, it signals to the investors:\n\n&gt;Come invest in India and the government will try to support you. However, the policies put by GOI still needs some improvement in terms of guidelines.\n\nIndia's policy of being a self dependent country is a good one but we need to also balance between depending too much on oneself and too much on other.\n\nAfter long time, a Prime Minister is trying to place equal emphasis on each state development. If all the states come together, India can propel even to greater heights. \n\nThe Smart Cities Mission is also a good initiative to encourage states to nominate cities to be redeveloped under the Smart Cities Mission. Under its scheme, it provides employment too to the citizens.  However there is still much to do. They could ensure that there is a balance of commercial, industrial and housing properties \n\nPM Modi has also various schemes to help the rural areas with this:\n\n[https://rural.nic.in/sites/default/files/StatePerformanceReport2020-21andActionPlan2021-22Volume1\\_16062021.pdf](https://rural.nic.in/sites/default/files/StatePerformanceReport2020-21andActionPlan2021-22Volume1_16062021.pdf)\n\nAccording to the statistics, rural areas are improving too. Modi Govt should do more besides the current schemes. However, they are still lagging behind the housing.\n\nWhat Modi and its cabinet ministers need to do is to ensure :\n\n1) India's Youths Talents are utilized fully by providing platform for them to showcase their talents, encouraging entrepreneurship. Provide them places to conduct entrepreneurship. \n\n2) Ensure that international funded projects are not stalled even if there is a change in government.\n\n3) Tighten the law admissions to induct good and sensible lawyers who can understand the purpose of development.\n\n4) Implement UCC, National Education Policy.\n\n5) Ensure each state has an equal proportion  of international airports. Some states have one international airport, some have three international airports, some have 5 international airports. Some airports do not have any international flights to Odisha. \n\n6) Have a good public transport network by connecting rural and urban areas. \n\n7) Ensure there is a central agency to monitor the progress of each schemes."<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'rbjfxf'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rbjfxf/lee_was_disappointed_with_india_thehindu/</li>

Thera had once criticized, during a lecture, the suffocating security measures that Chanakya had advocated for the king and royal family, to which he had replied that the nobles were, of course, free to live as ordinary peasants, abandoning both the comforts and responsibilities of noble life.\n\nIt was at midnight that she woke her Professor.\n\nShe hesitated, for it was always considered to do so (even though Chanakya had told her that falsehood was the only thing that caused offense at Taxila), yet the alternative would have been even less polite.\n\nAddressing him respectfully as was typical for such social rituals, she told him of the message and of her departure.\n\nChanakya stared sharply in her eyes for a few seconds.\n\nThen he asked: ‚ÄúWhat security concern to you could be more pronounced here in India than in Greece?‚Äù\n\nThera shrugged helplessly.\n\n‚ÄúHow did you guess it is a security concern?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúDo noble families in Greece typically send their children to hard labour, conscript them to fight in armies, marry them off or sell them to slavery? Are there any disasters about to hit Taxila that the Greeks are aware of? Have you engaged in any undignified behaviour since arriving at Taxila that your family may wish you to cease?‚Äù\n\nThera smiled a little ‚Äì a less arrogant man would have thought of, perhaps, education before child labour, marriage, conscription, slavery, prostitution and the apocalypse, but Chanakya was so certain (and admittedly correctly so) of the superiority of Taxila over any institution that could possibly exist in Greece that it was blasphemy to even suggest that Seleucus may have preferred a Greek school to Taxila.\n\n‚ÄúI suppose that makes sen‚Äîwait, how do you know my family is noble?‚Äù\n\nChanakya waved her question off. ‚ÄúNonetheless,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúAs your Professor and well-wisher, I must advise you to not go. I believe that whatever dangers your family may be wary of, will only be exacerbated by a three-month journey across Persia. I believe I know the cause of your family‚Äôs actions, and if I am right in my suspicions, then there may be some in the Persian government who also share these suspicions, and act accordingly.‚Äù\n\nThera couldn‚Äôt even consider disobeying Seleucus, and said so. She looked into Chanakya‚Äôs eyes to see if he was saddened by her departure, but his face held its usual stoic look.\n\n‚ÄúVery well then,‚Äù Chanakya said after a short pause, as if he had just finished a quick calculation of the effectiveness of pressing further and decided against it. ‚ÄúAs your education is not complete, I believe there are no remaining formalities between us.‚Äù\n\nIt was still odd, even to a girl of noble birth as herself, to hear a boy of her own age speak in such a *professorial* way about formalities and such.\n\nThey stayed quiet for a moment.\n\nFeeling a cold winter gust, Thera wrapped her toga tighter.\n\n‚ÄúI feel like our conversation ought to be more personable for two friends parting,‚Äù she said finally, trying not to sound too emotional. ‚ÄúI do not even know what to say, for the only pleasantry in Sanskrit for *Cha√≠re* \\[1\\] is *See you again*, while we are parting‚Äì‚Äù her voice broke, ‚Äú‚Äìmost likely forever.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou may have overestimated that likelihood,‚Äù Chanakya said, considering.\n\nHer face brightened. ‚ÄúYou intend to travel to Greece?‚Äù\n\nHe scowled.\n\nOf course not. Of course he would not waste half a year of his life on travel.\n\nBut he did not clarify, and she did not ask further, even though she desperately wanted to know what it was that he predicted, and instead merely tried not to get her hopes up.\n\nThe moon was full.\n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she spoke, nervously and biting her lip, ‚ÄúEven as tongues may differ, gestures are universal. And this is a universal gesture for *Cha√≠re*‚Äî‚Äù\n\nChanakya cut her off, stopping her mid-gesture.\n\n‚ÄúThat is *not* a parting gesture among the Indians,‚Äù he said in a slightly angry tone. ‚ÄúIt is a *romantic* one.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ I know.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*But other things \\[the Indians\\] do which one cannot approve: for instance, that they eat always alone, and that they have no fixed hours when meals are to be taken by all in common, but each one eats when he feels inclined. The contrary custom would be better for the ends of social and civil life.*\n\n‚ÄîMegasthenes, according to Strabo XV, i. 53-56, pp. 709-10.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nChanakya watched Tara speak some words in Greek to the Ajivika Professor Dirghalochana‚Äôs parrot that she had befriended.\n\nHis mind was not occupied by fruitless thoughts of romance and personal relationships. Despite the pains it imposed on him to spurn her embrace ‚Äì as Arjuna had spurned the Matsya princess ‚Äì Chanakya knew that had been right, for there was great value in the restraint of the senses. There was no advantage to childhood romances, as neither the faculties of pleasure nor those of child-bearing were developed at such an age, and since these romances never blossomed into marriage ‚Äì as the famed cautionary tale of the Shoorasenas attested ‚Äì they were entirely destructive to the goal of *kama*.\n\nNeither were his thoughts occupied with worry for the political implications of their closeness, for that was a calculation that he had made much earlier. He knew very well that his mere friendship with a Greek girl ‚Äì even if she had only expressed her affections to him in private and quite late ‚Äì could potentially be wielded against him by his rivals to throw shade on his motives, or even cause well-meaning allies to be distrustful of the same. Why, that would be the smear campaign that Chanakya would have run against himself, had he been in the position of such a rival.\n\n*I do not comment on whether there is anything wrong in giving education to a barbarian girl, but for a boy who had merely just ended his celibacy, we would be fools to not see the conflict in interest! A learned Brahmin who so unorthodoxly ends his celibacy in his childhood ‚Äì why, very possibly for the barbarian girl herself ‚Äì is that in whom we choose to place our trust? Is there truly no one else whom we can look to as a leader?*\n\nBut he had accepted her as a student despite these implications, for he had immediately judged her to be of noble birth, and as the Greeks bordered on the Western fringe of the Persian empire, her many valuable qualities made her a potentially useful ally. So there were no new revelations on this.\n\nNo, Chanakya‚Äôs thoughts were occupied with matters far more important.\n\nSomething big was happening in Greece.\n\nSomething that Tara did not understand, though her brother certainly did.\n\nSomething that quite possibly, the Persians themselves did not understand.\n\nNo internal political trouble could have caused the Greeks to regard their own country as safer for Tara than India ‚Äì no, such a threat had to be foreign. Such a threat had to be *Persian*.\n\nIt was a mistake, Chanakya realized, to regard the Greeks as simply some distant barbarian tribe ‚Äì they had their own cities, and until recently, they had been comprised of several countries similar to the Mahajanapadas. But in the most recent generation, the kingdom of Macedon, that Tara belonged to, had embarked on the goal of conquering all of Greece.\n\n(The method of ascertaining truth from a person who did not actively wish to lie to you, but may potentially be lying to themselves, was to decide beforehand the answers to what questions were relevant for your purposes, rather than to allow them to state their narrative on their own accord. Thus, Chanakya was fairly certain of the truth of what he had learned from Tara.)\n\nPersia‚Äôs great secret to its stability was that it closely regulated the militias that its vassals could possess, choosing to collect large numbers of troops from them as tribute and thus centralizing its imperial army. This made local rebellions impossible ‚Äì conversely, it also made them ineffectual in fighting against an external threat.\n\nIn India, the regions bordering the Persian empire were ruled by disunited mercenary-run states of the Eastern Punjab, which while warlike and unconquerable, were also naturally unwilling to launch a concerted invasion of either bordering empire. The reverse was true in Greece, where Macedon had united the country under an ambitious monarch.\n\nThe Greeks were planning, in secret, an invasion of Persia.\n\nChanakya was certain of it.\n\nAnd that made them his allies.\n\nThere were two methods of forming alliances. One was the explicit way, secured by words and treaties, or the exchange of hostages. The other was the natural way, for even in the absence of communication between parties, simply by virtue of the parties‚Äô geographical positioning and their motives, the goals of two states may coincide, and their actions may benefit each other.\n\nTo employ *either* method, an ambitious statesman had to learn to identify opportunities when they were afforded to him by circumstance, and to avail himself of them.\n\nChanakya‚Äôs eyes, steely in conviction, turned towards the moonless sky, his red dhoti quietly waving in the strong winds resemblant of a royal banner.\n\nThe game had begun.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**‚ÄîEND OF THE TAXILA CHAPTER‚Äî**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *Cha√≠re* ‚Äì goodbye, in Ancient Greek'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'rbh2dp'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/rbh2dp/the_great_empire_ch_1_takshashila_khanda_111/</li>

They regularly attended a gurudwara with their grandfather and grew their hair long like any good Sikh until they were 12-years-old and decided to cut it after their religious grandfather passed away. They attended a Sikh private school for the first few years of their schooling but attended secular elementary and middle-schools and a Catholic high-school afterwards. This person has only visited India once as a small child and does not remember that experience because they were too young at the time. They have an interest in learning about Indian culture and history and are very knowledgeable about India. They may even know more about certain aspects of India than native-born Indians. They have a fully Indian first, middle, and last name. They do not really "look" Indian, you would mistake them for being fully-European or somewhere near there at first-glance.

Now we all understand that whatever happened was unfortunate and WAS A MISTAKE.

Infact this could be a case of bad intel or Army being set up. Investigations are underway , but cursing the Army and attacks on army camps by locals is outright unjustified.

      <li>Title::: "Dr. Lenny DaCosta from Goa claims that the Yogi Adityanath government disobeyed GoI's directive not to use ivermectin, and this decision brought down UP case load from 60,000 to 200 in a few months."<br />Body: "I believe in vaccines and am double vaccinated. The purpose of this post is to encourage discussion about whether ivermectin can prevent cytokine storms and save lives, whether it should be used. Dr. Lenny, in the video linked below, appears to say natural immunity and good diet is the best. I disagree with that and feel everyone must take vaccines as they drastically reduce the chances of symptoms and death. I'm repeating myself: the purpose of this post is only to discuss whether ivermectin is good for mitigating covid. Also, my last post on this sub got only 1 comment. More participation would be appreciated.\n\nIn this [video] (https://odysee.com/@RebelNews:9/doctor-discusses-ivermectin-success-in-india-questions-canadas-covid-approach:f) by Rebel News, Dr. Lenny DaCosta from Goa claims that ivermectin use in India was withdrawn after a group of lawyers filed a case against Soumya Swaminanthan. He says that in the first wave, the symptoms would fester for 8 days before the cytokine storm developed, when the body's immune system attacks itself. Therefore, it was possible to treat the symptoms in the preceding days and save the patient.\n\nIn the 2nd wave, the cytokine storm happened on the 5th day. People who got symptoms would think it's the common cold for the first two days, then submit their samples on the 3rd day, and by the time the results came in 48 hours later the cytokine storm arrived and the patient passed away.\n\nAccording to DaCosta, Goa and Uttar Pradesh disobeyed the GoI's sudden removal of authorisation for Invermectin, and rampantly administered Ivermectin to anybody who tested positive. Kits of Zinc, vitamins and ivermectin were given to entire families in every village and town. The corpses of people floating in the Yamuna, women abusing the BJP government and crying for their families who died due to lack of oxygen, are all fresh in my mind. But, according to DaCosta, UP govt. brought down the case rate from 60,000 to 15,000 in about 2 months. By September, UP only had 200 cases. The US, meanwhile had 200,000 cases despite higher vaccination. According to the other sub, this is due to underreporting and media censorship in UP. The people are still dying in large numbers, they say. But if that was the case, social media would be full of posts and videos about these deaths. It's impossible to hide widespread chaos and suffering since everyone has a smartphone and 4G internet. Since that's not the case, the only explanation is something worked and UP was able to reduce the case load despite poor social distancing and comparatively lower vaccination rates.\n\nThere have been cases where Russia-linked companies paid YouTubers to spread misinformation and cause vaccine hesitancy. Indians were also part of this scam. But, I don't think DaCosta is a quack or a fraud. His views on whether vaccines are necessary and safe to administer without years of testing may be questionable, but his views and use of ivermectin is what I wish to discuss here. Also, the WHO list still includes ivermectin in their list of essential medicines.\n\nThe facts on the ground say Kerala stopped administering ivermectin, and has been the biggest contributor to Covid cases for the past several months. UP and Goa continued administering ivermectin, and now either there is censorship or the cases have come down.

      <li>Title::: 'So today I had a fight with my neighbor and would like your opinions on how I should proceed legally.'<br />Body: '\nSo today a physical fight broke out against my neighbor. It was 3 of us, my father, brother and me versus 5 of them. I am 22, my brother barely 18 and my father in his 50s and they were all well-built and muscular. What happened is that cuz of mere parking issue near our home, the fight broke out. One of the neighbors, started abusing my father and saying "ye joota khane wala aadmi hai" and my brother heard it first and called out the mf by saying "aukaad me reh ke baat kro". That mf got aggressive and provoked him and I had a feeling there was gonna be a fight(the neighbor said "ruk tu niche aa btata hu" and started banging on the main door). I was scared for my brother\'s safety so I went ahead and grabbed the bat for self defense. \n\nThey pulled me out as soon as they saw bat in my hand and that neighbor\'s brother and his stooge started pulling the bat away for me. I knew if I let them do that, God knows what would have happened to me or my family so I held tight onto it. I was so scared and invested into this that I didn\'t see my bro and that other neighbor were 2 to 1. Apparently, as we saw our cctv footage as soon as I was pulled out by those 2 aggressors my bro was pulled out too and got 2 to 3 blows on back and face(I swear if I would have seen it happening I would have literally swunged the bat on my neighbor\'s head. My bro\'s safety was paramount for me). My bro pulled a few on that mf\'s face too and the guy literally covered his face as he ran back. But I was still grabbed by those 2 mf and when my father(he was also being pushed around by the neighbor\'s workers on a car) and bro came to help me again they started pushing them, mostly my father cuz he was close to me. Then after a few moments it all stopped and we exchanged warnings to each other. My father and mother don\'t want to call the police cuz they don\'t want anymore "jhamela" but I know they are scared to do so.\n\nSo should I complaint to the police regarding this incident? I have the cctv footage which clearly shows who was the aggressor. Also what charges can be pressed against them?\n\nPS: My neighbor also threatened to break our car\'s window.'<br />Author: 'Crazycocfan'  id: 'ra5sjy'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ra5sjy/so_today_i_had_a_fight_with_my_neighbor_and_would/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Why I think there should be more 'Hindi' stand up comedians in India."<br />Body: "Let's directly get to the point, English is seen as a sign of Intellect in India. A person can say bullshit in English and yet get away with people thinking he is an intellectual. I don't want to point out specifically but there are several Instances where you would have seen it in media/politics. \n\nWhat most English stand up comedians do, is give Indians a sense of ' intellectual humour ' while feeding them with  jokes and making them sound wittier than they actually are. You can go today, and see any Indian English stand up comedian,(I would recommend the one you have already watched) and try to translate their jokes to hindi. You will realise their punchlines are actually way lamer when you perform it in Hindi. It's way harder to sound witty in hindi than it is to sound in English. \n\nI don't oppose them, and it's not like good English stand ups don't exist. English stand up comedy is as much an art as anything else, it's just that some comedians take advantage of the Indian mindset (fun fact, it's actually not just India, it's actually a general mindset that people speaking foreign language are smarter. A guy speaking Spanish in America would seem equally or even more as an intellectual than what we see English speakers here) and give a lower quality stand up. and honestly, when there will be more Hindi stand up comedians, we will really Start seeing the difference.\n\nAnd it's not like we don't have them already. Abhishek upmanyu, zakir Khan, anubhav singh bassi, all are fabulous. But where I see this is most of the newer stand up comedians. Most newer stand up comedians go for English stand up rather than hindi stand up. I don't know if that's what's my feed's feeding to me or that's really the case. But if that's really the case, we should encourage Hindi stand up comics more. And if English comics have a sense of intellect to their jokes, hindi ones have more connection.\n\nIt's a win-win for both, English and Hindi stand up comedy scene. Most of the political jokes will start sounding like that whining uncle on our whatsapp groups(and I am taking no side here, be it right wing or left wing, both jokes feel trash to me. Only reason being you don't actually have to do much research for a joke, exactly opposite of what a soft political topic needs. Topics like caa and farm laws need a good debate, and much more research than some opIndia or the quint article or some random tweet by kangana Ranaut or diljeet Dosanjh.) And they would have to work on their punchlines, making English stand up better. \n\nThat's it from me"<br />Author: 'DiamondOutside'  id: 'r9mic6'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r9mic6/why_i_think_there_should_be_more_hindi_stand_up/</li>

I've tried all sorts of things. Meditation, behavior modification, changing environments, changing schedules, negative reinforcement with a taser,even tried using a almost lethal amount of caffeine just to focus. \n\nThe only subjects that can hold my attention are physics and programming.

Yahya hasn‚Äôt had such fun since the last Hindu massacre!‚Äù, said grand architect of US foreign policy Kissinger.Nixon compared yahya to Abraham Lincoln'<br />Body: 'Nixon considered Yahya as a friend comparing him to Abraham Lincoln; a sick irony considering that the American Civil War president freed darker-skinned Americans from slavery, while Yahya was intent on enslaving the largely Muslim and Bengali-speaking darker-skinned majority of East Pakistan under the boot of the somehow more Islamic and ‚Äòtrue‚Äô Muslim lighter-skinned Punjabi and Pathan elite.\n\nKissinger saw him useful, especially in pursuing d√©tente with Chairman Mao. As Eisenhower‚Äôs vice president, the former had visited Pakistan in 1953 and returned convinced that Pakistan could aid America‚Äôs efforts to contain communist expansionism. ‚ÄúPakistan is a country I would like to do everything for,‚Äù Nixon said on his return home.\n\nLess than six months later, America entered into a military pact that over the next decade delivered to Pakistan $2 billion worth of American military equipment. By the time Nixon became president, in 1969, Pakistan‚Äôs dependency on American aid and military supplies was deep and appetitive. Six months before Yahya Khan ordered his military onto the streets in East Pakistan, he had visited Nixon to secure promises of more arms and supplies. ‚ÄúWe will try to be as helpful as we can,‚Äù Nixon assured the dictator. On 9 November 2013, Sunil Khilani wrote the aptly titled In 1971 a Genocide took Place in the New Republic (http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115435/gary-basss-blood-telegram-reviewed-sunil-khilnani ). Khilnani is Avantha Professor and director of the India Institute at King‚Äôs College London and the author of The Idea of India:\n\nFor Nixon and Kissinger, it became above all a reputational matter: they had to show the Chinese that they would support their Pakistani ally through any crisis. Kissinger, on his return from China, told Nixon: ‚ÄúThe cloak and dagger exercise in Pakistan arranging the trip was fascinating. Yahya hasn‚Äôt had such fun since the last Hindu massacre!‚Äù\n\nKhilani continues:\n\nThey therefore felt justified in expanding military support to Pakistan: illicitly supplying jet aircraft, sending the Seventh Fleet led by the USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal to intimidate the Indians, and passing secret messages urging the Chinese to mass troops on their Indian border. It was a view of India‚Äôs intentions that comported with Nixon‚Äôs and Kissinger‚Äôs picture of India‚Äôs leaders as cunning and ambitious adventurers who, relying on Soviet support, were bent on an all-out military campaign to dismember Pakistan, to expel the American presence from South Asia, and to sabotage U.S. interests across the world. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let these goddamn, sanctimonious Indians get away with this. They‚Äôve pissed on us on Vietnam for five years, Henry,‚Äù Nixon told his adviser.\n\nIn late April 1971, at the very height of the mass murder, Kissinger sent a message to General Yahya Khan, thanking him for his ‚Äúdelicacy and tact.‚Äù Dexter Filkins, a staff writer for The New Yorker and formerly a correspondent in South Asia for The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times has reviewed Bass‚Äôs book on the Blood Telegram. On 27 September 2013 he wrote Collateral Damage in the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/the-blood-telegram-by-gary-j-bass.html?pagewanted=2\n\nThe voices of Kissinger and Nixon are the book‚Äôs most shocking aspects. Bass has unearthed a series of conversations, most of them from the White House‚Äôs secret tapes, that reveal Nixon and Kissinger as breathtakingly vulgar and hateful, especially in their attitudes toward the Indians, whom they regarded as repulsive, shifty and, anyway, pro-Soviet ‚Äî and especially in their opinion of Indira Gandhi. ‚ÄúThe old bitch,‚Äù Nixon called her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why the hell anybody would reproduce in that damn country but they do,‚Äù he said.\n\nIn fact Nixon and Kissinger loathed India bordering on the fanatic. According to the conversation from 26 May 1972 from the US National Archives (http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve07/d135 )between Nixon and Kissinger, the latter candidly expressed his view that the Indians were ‚Äúsuch bastards‚Äù, ‚Äúdevious‚Äù, ‚Äúthe most aggressive goddamn people around‚Äù, and should ‚Äúpipe down‚Äù. Nixon agreed and said that what India really needed right now was a ‚Äúmass famine‚Äù'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'r9d80d'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r9d80d/the_wests_grooming_of_radical_islam_the_cloak_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hate against sikhs in this subreddit.'<br />Body: "Sikhism is a religion of equality, of seflessness, of sharing and caring. What Bhindranwala did was not sikhism. He was not a Guru. He was not a saint. Every sikh is a learner and there is only one Guru, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Any sikh who proclaims themselves to be saintly is a con man and doesn't deserve to be called a sikh.\n\nMost sikhs don't even give a damn about all that. They just wanna live their lives in peace. It's the youth that has too much free time on their hands that get manipulated by the extremists and those few who have been indoctrinated since they were young. Sikhism is about earning an honest living and respecting all humans. Terrorism is the exact opposite of what my religion preaches. Extremism has no place in India. This guy, this... Sidhu Moosewala... He's let fame get to his head. A singer entering politics who got his college education from a crappy institute in Ludhiana. He knows nothing about politics. Really, what a disappointment.\n\nI identify myself as a sikh and I cut my hair. It's my right to practice my religion however I want because my country allows me to do so. In Bhindranwala's Khalistan, I would have been killed. He didn't just kill hindus, he killed everyone who didn't have a long beard and long hair. Was Indira Gandhi wrong in doing what she did? Well, she could have waited for a few days. Did that justify her assassination? No. It was wrong and countless innocents suffered because of that. It was an era of darkness. Past is something we learn from. Something bad happened, we learn from it and never let it happen again. Living in the past is detrimental for all. \n\n\nI see so much hate against my community in this subreddit that it churns my stomach. Calling sikhs khalistanis and terrorists and what not. I know that me saying anything in defense of my religion and my community will not sway a single person here because your opinions are already set. Still, I wanted to say this here just to get it out there.

Apologies for the duplication). \n\nThe Western project of maligning Hinduism rests on the strawman called the caste system. They have really managed to make it stick in the past, and it is critical for the enemies of Hinduism that this strawman never becomes irrelevant.\n\nHindutva, on the other hand, is avowedly anti-caste. It has the power to cut across the faultlines and unite the Sanatanis like never before.\n\nHence the hate for Hindutva, and hence the need to brand it as being extremist. Divided Sanatana is of great importance to the enemies of Bharatvarsha.\n\nWe must never let them have it. We have to kill the caste discrimination , and unite.\n\nJai Hindutva. \n\nJai Shree Ram.'<br />Author: 'AlbusDT'  id: 'r82izi'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r82izi/why_do_they_want_to_dismantle_hindutva/</li>

What do you think he did there'<br />Body: "Sometime ago, there was a speculative discussion at my home and one of my dad's acquaintances took a shot at it. Take a guess and see the spoiler. My dad used to be in active politics, is a lot people's man and he invites people from all walks of life over dinner frequently .. like local politicians, teachers, religious leaders, business men, police officers  .. and so on. Though I don't participate in those discussions, I do overhear them and some of them are very interesting. So take a guess!\n\n&gt;!Ajit Doval could have laid grass roots network for mass islamization. He would have set up financial, logistical, support system in which large scale madrasa education is encouraged. He would have set up financial networks from abroad to create opportunities for Islamic education. It doesn't even need to be extremist at all. It could be regular normal education that doesn't even fall on the radar of authorities. In other words no one would lift a finger against these. And seeing that these Islamic education centers are very moderate, it wouldn't even have difficulty in obtaining funds even locally too. They would be self sustaining too. The idea is every moment a citizen spends time on religion, he is further away from being a useful and productive citizen of the Nation. And since Islam claims to be one true religion, no one would find a reason to object to this and more over it would be welcomed. So it is using what they like to hurt them and they wouldn't even realize it. And importantly even if they do realize they can't do anything but watch their society go down the drain. !&lt;\n\nToday something happened in our neighboring country so, it reminded me of this."<br />Author: 'ennis-jahsiah'  id: 'r7yd4k'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r7yd4k/we_know_that_shri_ajit_doval_spent_sometime_as_an/</li>

As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/12/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTaxila was losing.\n\nIt was as if dark clouds had formed over the arena at Salatura, yet such clouds that passed without providing rainfall.\n\nVictory after victory, the university, with all its scholars and students, had forgotten the feeling of defeat.\n\nIn the nearly four hundred years of the Annual Debates held in the honour of the ancient philosopher Yajnavalkya, from whose works all schools of thought had birthed, the site and sponsors of the debates had changed numerous times, but the contest had remained the most prestigious of such events for scholars and students alike; its pride and prestige remaining unchallenged even by the Royal Debates of Gandhara. \n\nScholars would pour in year after year, coveting the contest‚Äôs generous prizes, and wealthy families fought for the honour of sponsoring it, just as cities competed for the glory of hosting the debate. \n\nThe university currently held a twenty-year winning streak, but this year, after reaching the finals, found itself dangerously close to losing the crown to the Mushtika University of Sindh ‚Äì truly a humiliation, as that was an institution that those of Taxila had long held to be merely an inferior imitation of their own university.\n\nIt was not because the sponsor, the wealthy merchant Valgujangha, was himself of Sindh, and had received his education at the Mushtika University ‚Äì to the contrary, Valgujangha‚Äôs repute for fairness in all his business dealings was matched only by his honesty and truthfulness.\n\nNo. As the final contestants warred with words in the central arena, it became very obvious that Taxila had grown complacent in its position. Its representative, the seventeen-year-old student Sushrava, was obviously woefully unprepared and lacking in clarity of thought ‚Äì stumbling over his words, he allowed himself to be completely dominated by Pratikshatra, the older man who represented Mushtika. \n\nCurious and wide-eyed, an eleven-year-old Greek girl watched from the back of the great ampitheatre.\n\n*Between heroism and discipline, which quality is more desirable in an army?* That was the question.\n\n‚ÄúInfused with valour, a skilful warrior may slay hundreds from atop his chariot,‚Äù said Pratikshatra, ‚ÄúFor of a man who knows no duty but that of war, surrender does not even cross his mind.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI hold that to be impossible, O respected Professor,‚Äù Sushrava objected, his voice nearly a squeak, ‚ÄúFor such feats as are quoted in accounts ‚Äì of an archer piercing thousands of armoured men with a single arrow, or a soldier crushing the skulls of half an army with a swing of his mace ‚Äì cannot truly be realistic, as they defy reason.‚Äù\n\nPratikshatra smiled concedingly. ‚ÄúIndeed the precise numbers may be bardic exaggeration,‚Äù he allowed, ‚ÄúBut the fact remains that some warriors were exalted for their incredible skill and competence, and raised above others in the minds of their followers ‚Äì thus my stance: that it is such qualities that a commander must inculcate in his army, rather than discipline.‚Äù\n\nSushrava took a full half-minute to respond. \n\nFinally, he admitted: ‚ÄúSuch warriors are to be honoured. I‚Äôm afraid, however, O respected Professor, that the Age of Heroes has long passed. The present is the Age of Empires, and imperial armies function on discipline more than bravery. It is not courage, but the ability of a commander to strategize effectively, that allows small armies to defeat great ones.‚Äù\n\nIt was not unheard of for a Greek to receive an education in India.\n\nTwo centuries ago, Pythagoras, the son of a wealthy man from Samos, had spent some years at Taxila. He had learned from the scholars here the laws of mathematics and music, and to introspect on the mind and on the meaning and causes of knowledge (a study he later gave the name ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù). Donning simple robes and rejecting meat as learned Indians did, he brought these ideas back with him to Greece, and thus the light of Classical Greece was lit by the torch of India.\n\n‚ÄúWhy *is* the Age of Heroes past us?‚Äù Pratikshatra questioned. ‚ÄúSurely it is human actions, and not the intervention of gods, that has lead to the dearth of heroes. You are young and naive, Sushrava, but it must be said, that is this very discipline that you exalt, that has crushed the heroism of the kshatriyas. In commanding them to conform to those rules that their superiors have set for them, we deprive them of the skill for intrigue, of their capacity to plan in situations not yet anticipated. And thus our dark times were born.‚Äù\n\nIt was also not unheard of for a woman to receive an education in India. \n\nIndeed, even in the earliest days, among the first debaters against Yajnavalkya himself had been the firebrand princess Maitreyi ‚Äì who had questioned him on matters of afterlife and immortality ‚Äì and Vachaknavi, the daughter of a minister, who had debated him on pertinent questions on the natural sciences. Both women would later become his wives.\n\nNonetheless, both occurrences were relatively rare, and the result of odd circumstances.\n\nIn the case of Thera Nicator, that circumstance was the untimely death of both her parents in a domestic squabble after her mother Laodice had claimed, to her father Antiochus‚Äôs distaste, that her children were sired by the god Apollo. Of course, the terming of this circumstances as ‚Äúodd‚Äù or ‚Äúunusual‚Äù was questionable: in Macedon, the men were violent, the women were insane, everyone was perpetually drunk, and glassware was abundant. \n\nWhile it was still not at all usual to send away an eleven-year-old girl away from family to study in the East, her brother Seleucus had been worried about her being used as a hostage during the political violence in Greece surrounding subsequent troubles in the Macedonian noble family ‚Äì much of such affairs he himself was involved in.\n\nShe had been admitted alongside a class of Persian students who studied various arts of Persia and India ‚Äì however, upon arriving at Taxila, she had found herself more drawn to studying the sciences of the Indian philosophers, and so she had abandoned her living quarters in Pushkalavati to stay within the campus of the University of Taxila itself, as the relatively studious Indians did.\n\n‚ÄúBut the capacity to plan in situations not yet anticipated is precisely the argument *for* discipline,‚Äù Sushrava argued. ‚ÄúDiscipline is the art of developing solutions in anticipation of problems instead of in reaction to them, and based on such considerations developing protocols to follow that will then be adhered to rigidly, and ensure victory.‚Äù\n\nUpon arriving at Taxila, she had quickly heard tales of Chanakya, the Golden Boy of Taxila, who was currently away, for at least three weeks, on a dangerous expedition to Magadha.\n\nIn all honesty, she found most of the viewpoints attributed to him to be so outrageous that it would be no exaggeration to say that merely hearing such opinions expressed had left her scarred for life. She took great objection to his thesis that ‚Äúwealth and wealth alone is important‚Äù, his defence of usury went completely against the teachings of Aristotle that she had held so sacred, and his apparent neutrality between many systems of government seemed plainly amoral. \n\nYet it was hard not to develop an admiration for his brilliance. \n\n‚ÄúA strategist cannot anticipate every possible outcome in battle,‚Äù Pratikshatra retorted harshly, ‚ÄúNor every trap that the enemy may institute in the midst of the battle. Thus it is necessary for this onus to fall on the individual soldier, to think for himself in the absence of, or in spite of orders. An army that possesses discipline alone is merely a phalanx of blind men walking off the edge of a cliff.‚Äù \n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù \n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù \n\nThe crowd watched.\n\nA wave of dejection had washed over the crowd from Taxila ‚Äì many of its younger members, who had never seen their university defeated in contest, found it inconceivable to so much as *imagine* what was unfolding before their very eyes. \n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù \n\nSushrava bowed his head.\n\nThere was a collective intake of breath from the audience ‚Äì scholars, students, merchants, nobles, peasants who had climbed the trees surrounding the amphitheatre to watch the iconic debates.\n\nThe despair was palpable.\n\nEven Thera, who was new to the university and to India, who did not yet fully grasp or relate to all its ways, understood the significance of the gesture.\n\n*It was the end of an era.*\n\n‚ÄúYou have convinced me of the truth of your viewpoint,‚Äù said Sushrava. ‚ÄúI had in my naivety, dismissed the entire enterprise of heroism as chaotic and based in emotion rather than reason. I had not considered the intellectual and strategic aspects of heroism‚Äî‚Äù he breathed in deeply, ‚Äú‚ÄîI concede.‚Äù\n\nNot one man spoke.\n\nNot one student from Taxila, not one student from Mushtika.\n\nThere was no ritual exchange of congratulatory pleasantries.\n\nFor those of Mushtika were *proud* ‚Äì but to be merry, to rejoice, when those of Taxila stood humiliated ‚Äì like a defeated army watching their capital city ravaged before their very eyes ‚Äì like a farmer watching his fields burn to a day before the harvest ‚Äì would have been the act of a *barbarian*. \n\nAn eternity followed.\n\nValgujangha rose at last, preparing to break the silence. Solemn and ceremonial, he addressed the attendees‚Äî\n\n‚Äîjust as a young voice cried out from somewhere near the East door: ‚Äú*I do not!*‚Äù \n\nGasps. Elation on the faces of the Taxila boys, and dread on the Mushtika ones‚Äô. \n\nEven as she did not recognize the voice herself, Thera inferred, from the sudden reinvigoration in her classmates, and the name *Chanakya* formed on her lips.\n\nStudents from across the amphitheatre scrambled, shuffled in place, to make way for the golden boy of Taxila ‚Äì their faces red and their hearts beating.\n\n‚Äú*Cha-na-kya! ‚Äì Cha-na-kya!‚Äù*\n\nPassionate informal drumming deafened her ears, and Thera had to lean on her toes to peer past the rows of heads, still catching but a quick glimpse. \n\nChanakya rode in on a horse, flanked by two boys too regally dressed to be his attendants. He did not tie his hair into a top-bun as was the standard for students at Taxila, instead leaving it untied, and his dhoti had taken a silvery-white hue.\n\n‚ÄúForgive me, *Sriman* \\[1\\],‚Äù he said, dismounting, ‚ÄúMy visit to Pataliputra involved a number of unforeseen detours ‚Äì I request your permission to represent my university in the debates of the last day.‚Äù\n\nThera could hardly imagine so much pomp in the citadel of Corinth if Poseidon himself rose from the sea in mid-noon. \n\nValgujangha was smiling, but his assistant called for order in the crowd, and the students (as well as some particularly excitable professors) slowly began to return to their places. \n\n‚ÄúThis is the final debate, Chanakya. Do you wish for a summary of the arguments made so far by each side?‚Äù\n\nChanakya grinned in amusement. \n\n‚ÄúI predict,‚Äù he said, inhaling deeply as if to relax, ‚ÄúThat my opponent‚Äôs arguments are as follows: warriors used to be more powerful in the Age of Heroes than they are now, that‚Äôs because discipline reduces creativity and valour, and commanders can‚Äôt predict the various outcomes of battle thus soldiers must be capable of making decisions individually on their own accord‚Äî‚Äù\n\nThera‚Äôs jaw dropped. The crowd exploded into cheers of amazement, prompting the attendant to hush them once again. \n\n‚Äú‚Äîhe has surely also made the tired analogy of a disciplined army to a phalanx of men blindly walking off a cliff even as they see its edge, and made the claim that a rigidly defined army can be defeated as it cannot adapt to its enemy.‚Äù\n\nPratikshatra shifted awkwardly. ‚ÄúIn all honesty, I did not think of the last point.‚Äù\n\nChanakya looked quite proud of himself. \n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he addressed the Professor, ‚ÄúPerhaps I should then also formulate your own rebuttals before you make them, then I would have a worthy opponent.‚Äù\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers. This time it was Chanakya who hushed them.\n\n‚ÄúInstead of addressing each one of your points,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI shall begin with a general observation about the nature of your arguments, and indeed of many debaters who hold incorrect stances on questions stated in of the form of comparisons. It is as if you have, instead of defeating your opponent in a swordfight, defeated a cripple of your own creation claiming ‚Äì and successfully convincing the audience and even your opponent ‚Äì that cripple to be your opponent.\n\n‚ÄúIn all your arguments, you have assumed the image, for I cannot even call it a defining characteristic, of a disciplined army as one that follows a certain small set of rigid and simplistic rules. You have assumed the image of a heroic army as one comprised of valiant and creative soldiers. Between these two, I have no doubt that the latter is superior. However, this is not what is commonly meant by these terms.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYour rebuttal is merely a game of semantics, Chanakya,‚Äù said Pratikshatra proudly, ‚ÄúSurely fire by any other name burns just as hot.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, you may call your mother *poison* and obesity *edible*, but that would not enable one to safely consume poison. If the objective of such arguments was merely a play with invented words, then your argument would be valid, as well as completely trivial. But the purpose of thought is action, and you expect your arguments to apply to the more common meanings of these terms. In doing so, you behave like a merchant who secures a large deal by promising silk fabrics, but instead delivers cotton or linen apparel ‚Äì or like a policeman who is told to execute a man by a certain name, but not finding the criminal, gives that name to an innocent civilian and executes him ‚Äì or like a preacher who describes his religion in vague platitudes, and demands your blood from you once you join his cult ‚Äì or like a scholar of a misguided school who says that in his ideal form of government, people will act very nobly and charitably, yet does not specify at all how his plans will cause them to do so ‚Äì or like a legislator who, in his argument to forbid a practice, uses only its most wicked manifestations as examples for his rhetorics, even as his own proposed laws do not prevent such evil. In short: your arguments are the intellectual equivalent of *fraud*.‚Äù\n\nThe faces of all those of Taxila ‚Äì including Thera herself, she imagined ‚Äì shone with a wordless emotion: like the faces of a routed army watching its champion ride into battle in full metal armour to turn the tides of war ‚Äì like the faces of the gods when Vishnu rose to defend them ‚Äì or like the face of the Earth goddess when Brahma descended to rescue her ‚Äì manifesting like dawn at the night‚Äôs darkest.\n\nRather ironic comparisons, Thera thought, as Chanakya was literally arguing against the importance of heroism.\n\nPratikshatra pressed on. ‚ÄúYour analogies are merely insults,‚Äù he complained, ‚ÄúYou have not explained how I have committed this fallacy you claim.‚Äù\n\nChanakya smiled wryly. ‚ÄúSurely you are a scholar of repute yourself, and recognize the mistakes in your argument when they are pointed at to you? But I shall spell it out. When people speak of a heroic army, they do not state any plan that will cause the individual soldiers of an army to act in a creative or valiant manner ‚Äì instead, they simply propose the elimination of discipline and claim that this will miraculously cause this outcome, even as this is contradicted by history ‚Äì for though we deride the Magadhas as barbarians, in part precisely for their disciplined armies, it remains true that they were able to completely annihilate the relatively undisciplined armies of the states to its West.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSurely you realize, Chanakya, that prior to the introduction of discipline, all such demonstrations of heroism were common and widespread among the armies of the Mahajanapada states?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere are many levels on which your argument can be refuted. Firstly, one may say that you have no way to demonstrate that this change was *caused* by the introduction of discipline. Second, one may point out the military successes of Magadha against the other states. But a more fundamental refutation is possible. While my classmate likely made claims to the effect of ‚Äì *heroic armies were suited for the Age of Heroes, but that glorious age is lost to us now, thus as we must make do with iron for the age of gold is lost to us, we must make do with disciplined imperial armies* ‚Äì in truth, there never *was* an Age of Heroes‚Äî‚Äù \n\nThera gasped, then shut her mouth when she got some weird looks. \n\n‚Äú‚Äîfor such an age is not found in the Vedas, merely in the poetry of bards. The Battle of the Ten kings was not won by warriors who slew ten times their own number, it was won by the cunning of Sage Vasishta who opened a dam to flood and kill off much of the unsuspecting enemy armies before the battle even began, and who shrewdly placed, in a manner that did not raise suspicion among scouts and spies, his own army into position to attack on command during the enemy‚Äôs rescue operations. The latter is certainly the exercise of discipline.‚Äù \n\nThe unbashed *anti-romanticism* of such words. It was shocking that they were even legal.\n\nThera felt rather conflicted ‚Äì on one hand, she wished to interrupt Chanakya and object to his damning rejection of the very existence of the Age of Heroes (*surely* it existed in Greece, and if the Indians had a similar story of such an age it must have existed in India too ‚Äì why was the existence of something so sacred even up for debate?) ‚Äì but on the other hand, despite having attended Taxila for less than a month, she too felt the jingoistic fever that had permeated the crowd since Chanakya‚Äôs arrival. Chanakya was a *hero*, his arrival a miracle to Taxila in its darkest of nights. To question him there was like including, in a prayer for rain, a criticism of Zeus‚Äôs treatment of Prometheus. \n\nEven Pratikshatra appeared to have lost all confidence at this point, merely pressing on to introduce an honourable delay to his inevitable surrender.\n\n‚ÄúSurely it follows from reason,‚Äù he argued, ‚ÄúThat instilling a standard protocol discourages a warrior from thinking for himself?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúHow, precisely, would you ensure that soldiers *do* think for themselves in the midst of battle? Perhaps by educating them earlier on the art of solving problems? And such an education would include practice problems, of course ‚Äì cases one may encounter in battle, and instruction on the optimal strategy for such cases. If only we had a name for such an education.‚Äù Chanakya smiled. ‚ÄúThe difference between an undisciplined army and a disciplined army is not that the former thinks for itself and the latter doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs that the former is forced to come up with solutions on the spot, as beasts must, rather than strategize in advance, as men do. You believe, wishfully, that each of your soldiers will think for themselves on the battlefield, even as you have no means to ensure it ‚Äì just as you believe wishfully that each of your soldiers will slay ten of your enemy‚Äôs, but that this will not be true of your enemy‚Äôs valour.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYour characterization is an insult to the great heroes of history and legend, like Arjuna, Rama, and Vishnu,‚Äù said Pratikshatra.\n\nHeracles, Odysseus, Achilles. Thera had to stop herself from vigorously nodding.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I may similarly say that you insult the great strategists of history,‚Äù replied Chanakya, ‚ÄúLike Vasishta, Krishna and Samkarshana ‚Äì or, for reasons aforementioned, that the rejection of discipline in warfare is a rejection of the intellect, and therefore of *Purusha* \\[2\\] himself. But I am not interested in the game of compliments and insults, as that is a game of gossip, and therefore is a concern of women, not of scholars.‚Äù\n\nThera observed the shift in Pratikshatra‚Äôs tone and posture of argument. He had abandoned his earlier pompous rhetoric, choosing instead a defensive position against Chanakya, and once that too had failed, he had attacked Chanakya on the basis of the morality of his stance. Even as she likely agreed with him on matters of policy, she had to confess that this was telling of a fundamental insincerity. \n\nIn a final attempt, Pratikshatra adopted yet another appearance: one of wisdom and calm temparement.\n\n‚ÄúHow blissful it is,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúTo be young and believe one knows everything. I must relish the nostalgia. You have studied under the Professors at Taxila, Chanakya, and have believed their words to be truth ‚Äì but I could name you tens of more experienced scholars at Mushtika and elsewhere, who have discussed at length the value of heroism over discipline, and the disaster that discipline has spelled for the kshatriya race.‚Äù\n\nChanakya gave a wry smile in response, that alone sufficed to rescue the university from a historic humiliation, and to secure Taxila its twenty-first consecutive victory at the Yajnavalkya Debates.\n\n‚ÄúTens of scholars?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúIf you were true, you would have needed only one.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*A covetous man may be won by means of a gift, an obstinate man by folded hands in salutation, a fool by humouring him ‚Äì but a learned man can only be won by the truth.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was only after returning to Taxila that Thera was able to catch up to Chanakya during dinner. \n\nShe introduced herself, then said: ‚ÄúI had some objections to what you said at the debate, but didn‚Äôt wish to betray you and the university by interrupting you mid-speech.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Chanakya started. ‚ÄúYou should have. If you were to defeat me now, my win would be tainted.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI was unaware,‚Äù she said shamefully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new to Taxila, and am not familiar with what‚Äôs considered polite.‚Äù\n\nChanakya, for all his apparent haughtiness from afar, said something fairly decent for once: ‚ÄúDo whatever is right, and no one will be offended in Taxila. Honesty is what we regard as polite; dishonesty is the gravest insult.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good advice,‚Äù Thera confessed.\n\nA short pause followed, during which Chanakya seemed rather annoyed. ‚ÄúDid you merely wish to *mention* that you have objections to what I said, or do you wish to debate me on them?‚Äù\n\nFeeling embarrassed, she gathered her thoughts, and expressed them in so many words, focusing specifically on how upsetting his nay-saying rejection of the ‚ÄúAge of Heroes‚Äù was.\n\nTo which Chanakya said: ‚ÄúNone of your objections have anything to do with the truth of my statements, and merely to do with how upsetting they are to you. To hold a value more sacred than the truth is to dishonour the goddess Sarasvati.‚Äù Furthermore, he explained, if wars were run on heroism alone, such heroism would be rather dull in itself, for the only job of a commander would be to maximize such spirits among his soldiers; it would not allow the plays and outplays ‚Äì or the rock-paper-scissors ‚Äì of strategic war. Indeed, he said, disciplined war merely made the strategist the hero, and such heroism was actually effective in large scale as the proponents of heroism claimed their own methods to be.\n\nThera then brought up yet another point of contention she had with what she had heard of Chanakya‚Äôs views, namely with his thesis that wealth and wealth alone is important. She explained that there were many things that *couldn‚Äôt* be bought with wealth, which he seemed to neglect.\n\nThis seemed to amuse Chanakya greatly, who asked: ‚ÄúI take it that your family is wealthy?‚Äù\n\nThera felt herself turning red. ‚ÄúVery,‚Äù she admitted.\n\n‚ÄúIt is only those born to wealth who do not understand its value, only those born with great intelligence who cannot comprehend what cognitive capacities they possess that others do not, and it is beautiful women who downplay the importance of being well-formed or shower dishonest praise on the beauty of their uglier friends. There is a great deal that wealth *can* buy, and wealth is an encapsulation of the deeds of a man ‚Äì for a man earns wealth by giving goods to his clients, and loses wealth by taking goods from sellers. There are indeed goods that money cannot buy, but an honest man must find it upsetting that such goods cannot be bought by money, and think of methods to make such goods purchasable to money, rather than celebrate such goods for their inability to be purchased by money.‚Äù \n\nThera raised more questions, about usury and other matters, and Chanakya must have grown tired of the smalltalk, because he then said: ‚ÄúIf you truly believe the things you say, you wouldn‚Äôt be so easily convinced by my single-point arguments without any further questioning, because you would have thought through these beliefs more thoroughly. I suspect that your true intention here has nothing to do with the topics you profess to care about, but rather to talk to me, such as to extract some favour or to merely make my acquaintance.‚Äù \n\nThera felt humiliated. Chanakya had humoured her so far like a friend, but perhaps she had pushed it too far at the end and caused him to adopt a stricter position as a professor and all. She recalled his earlier words: *Honesty is what we regard as polite; Dishonesty is the gravest insult*, and decided to be forthright: \n\n‚ÄúForgive me for my insincerity. I learned that you will soon become a Professor and have your own gurukula. I greatly respect your intellect, and wish to be your student.‚Äù \n\nChanakya declined emphatically. Thera‚Äôs heart sank.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIf you do just merely to make my acquaintance, I happen to need a wife for my graduation ceremony.‚Äù\n\nThera laughed, but then realized he may be serious, and that he might consider the child marriage of a barbarian girl ‚Äì even one of such noble birth as herself ‚Äì to be completely morally acceptable. \n\n‚ÄúIf I may press further,‚Äù she asked, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice, ‚ÄúWhy will you not accept me as a student?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI believe you do not quite understand the quality of students that I am taking for my gurukula,‚Äù said Chanakya. ‚ÄúYou are a student of the Persian arts, a discipline imposed on us by the imperial government, that is taken by princes lacking in intelligence and masculinity, to which admission is gained by uttering a few insincere words of flattery to the Persians.‚Äù\n\nNot wishing to be deterred so easily, Thera insisted: ‚ÄúBut I am trying to switch to an Indian education in the sciences‚Äî‚Äù she leaned forward conspiratorially, ‚Äú‚Äîand between you and me, I, and the Greeks in general, share the Indian opinion of the Persians. I do not have any words of flattery for them in my *mind*.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that you, and the Greeks in general, also agree with the Indian opinion on the proper method to wash oneself after defecating‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Äîactually, we don‚Äôt agree on that‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Äîbut it is through discussing disagreement, not agreement, that the progress of the world is achieved. Agreement is the consequence, not the cause, of a successful debate that dispels false beliefs on either or both sides.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am willing to discuss our disagreements.‚Äù Feeling a little brave, she added: ‚ÄúBut let me warn you that your perceptions of the Greeks may be quite incorrect. For instance, we have our own great cities, just like India and Persia do, and our own sciences, just like India does.‚Äù\n\nChanakya gave her a skeptical look, but didn‚Äôt seem offended that a foolish barbarian girl had dared to defy him. \n\n‚ÄúThere is a tale that is often told of the Greeks,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúAs a warning to travellers visiting foreign countries and as a solemn reminder of the superiority of Vedic culture. Of a scholar by the name of Shukrata who was executed in Greece for his political views.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSocrates‚Äôs execution was a tragedy and an indictment of Athenian democracy,‚Äù Thera agreed. ‚ÄúBut matters have changed now. Socrates‚Äôs student‚Äôs student, a philosopher by the name of Aristotle, is now employed as a teacher by the royal family that rules Greece.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúIf another philosopher were to speak negatively of Socrates, or of this student‚Äôs student, would he be executed?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWithout doubt!‚Äù Thera replied haughtily, then realized the implication.\n\n‚ÄúThen things haven‚Äôt changed at all,‚Äù said Chanakya. ‚ÄúNo more than the welfare of a slave who is passed from one master to another. The Greeks have no law against *Brahmahatya* \\[3\\], indeed their governments actively engage in that wicked practice ‚Äì that reason, among others, is why we regard the Greeks as barbarians.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù said Thera. ‚ÄúJust as the wicked practice of widow-burning is why we regard the Indians as barbarians.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\nThera was certain that she had crossed a line, and readied herself to prostrate herself and beg for forgiveness, when Chanakya cracked a small smile. \n\n‚ÄúPhilosophers are more important than widows,‚Äù he said at last. ‚ÄúBut I will accept you as my student.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Learned men are envied by the foolish; rich men by the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *sriman ‚Äì* literally ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù, used like ‚ÄúSir‚Äù or ‚ÄúMr‚Äù in the absence of standard noble honorifics\n\n\\[2\\] *Purusha* ‚Äì Literally ‚ÄúMan‚Äù, representing consciousness/free will in some sense. *Prakriti* ‚Äì Literally ‚ÄúNature‚Äù, depicted as feminine. \n\n\\[3\\] *Brahmahatya ‚Äì* killing of a Brahmin (scholar/philosopher)'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'r5whea'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r5whea/the_great_empire_ch_1_takshashila_khanda_110_hero/</li>

Unless I'm mistaken, except a brief period of 2 years, they were never under govt control.Am assuming their earnings should be pretty decent. In all these years,how much have they spent on Hindu causes like stopping conversion,Hindu hospital &amp; schools to ensure Hindus dont fall prey to missionary circuit, proselytisation of Hinduism, funding for Hindu mythology based movies, etc?\n\n\nQuestion for those who claim freeing temples from govt control would be the ultimate salvation of Hindus. Without a waqf like board to ensure Hindu religious earnings are used for Hindu cause, how is it helping in any way?"<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'r5jpir'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r5jpir/char_dham_of_uttarakhand_are_amongst_the_holiest/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Discuss: voting should be a privilege that needs to be earned, not a right that's given by default"<br />Body: "I'm unsure if something to this effect was posted before but wanted a discussion on this. The pros, the cons etc. \n\nA lot of problems with existing democracies stem from (imo) a lack of critical thought from the voters prioritizing the wellbeing of the nation. People vote to get freebies (directly in payments or indirectly via promises of subsidies). There is the vote bank politics and a move by certain politicians to bring in illegals with promise of freebies with taxpayers money in exchange of votes, then there are people who rather let the country burn than let the other side get any brownie points. \n\nThe underlying issue imo is that people aren't invested in the long term nation building but rather look at (often petty) short term gains. This in turn is because they don't have enough skin in the game. \n\nI wonder if things would be a lot better if you get to vote only if you have contributed in some fashion (income taxes beyond a certain slab, sportspeople, defense personnel, educators/scientists, people of arts etc). \n\nThe side effect is that really poor people have no vote but then as far as I've seen, their priority (for obvious reasons) is in making their ends meet over spending time thinking of geopolitics etc."<br />Author: 'CommonCantaloupe2'  id: 'r5immy'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r5immy/discuss_voting_should_be_a_privilege_that_needs/</li>

      <li>Title::: "If a situation like CoVID arises and people die due to government's fault, it should repay the tax money, at least, the income tax, the person paid during their lifetime."<br />Body: "I read a post on another sub about Rahul Gandhi demanding the government to pay Rs. 4 lakhs to the families of people who died during CoVID. for what I thought, this was a stupid idea and the money would be better used to prepare healthcare for the future. But, isn't this the case many of the times?\n\nI've heard the government distributing compensation like 5-15 lakhs, but is it enough to support a family who lost their primary bread earner? Speaking of a mid tier city, and accounting for an unaffected lifestyle, 5-6 lakhs/annum is a minimum, so how long is this gonna hold up?\n\nWe pay our government hefty taxes in all times, for times of emergency like this too, so that, when an emergency of this scale occurs, they could to the right thing to protect us. Shouldn't the government think about this and developing basic HR facilities in normal times like healthcare, education, transport, clean surroundings, rather than ott spending in flashy things like the world's tallest statue, military power and useless schemes?\n\nI know the fraction is a very small fraction of people who pay income tax, but they don't deserve to have such an insulting and inhuman treatment becuase they were the ones who did the right thing,\n\n\n they don't deserve such an ending where the system, which they trusted in, is such an imbecile when it comes to saving them.\n\nWe are not blind idiots people, who will pay exorbitant amounts of taxes. Even a bank or investor asks you for detailed plans and strategy before giving you a few lakhs to crores, then how can we not scrutinize and, if so ever happens to be,  refuse to pay our hard earned rupees."<br />Author: 'crustbin13'  id: 'r54aeb'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r54aeb/if_a_situation_like_covid_arises_and_people_die/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'CALL FOR HELP (MANIPAL UNIVERSITY JAIPUR)'<br />Body: "Hello my fellow citizens of India,\n\nI    am writing this message because students have been facing the wrath  of   the MUJ Administration. Due to the recent COVID spike, we have been    sending mails for a while for exams to be conducted in online mode  and   have been getting no responses. Even when we get responses, they    threaten to take disciplinary actions against us for raising our voice.    Last February, when the situation was normal, we went back to our    college and there was a huge increase in the cases, but the    administration and hostel authorities tried to cover it all up. Now,    they are forcing us to give online exams throughout the whole semester.    Even our mid-term exams have been online, and even our labs have been    online. In addition, they are saying that they want us to give offline    exams because it hurts the credibility of the institution and the    placement rate. Well, we all had our placements online, and we had one    of the best seasons till date. Furthermore, colleges from IIT, IIIT,    VIT, and SRM are all conducting online exams. And even so, the hostel    right now is fully packed with our hostel asking us to pay 30k for one    month+10k mess fees (with an additional 15K security deposit). Not only    this, but the students are not even wearing masks and no rules are   being  followed. Moreover, one of my friends received a threatening call   from  the head of student welfare today and said that disciplinary   action  would be taken against him for tweeting against the university   on  Twitter and even told him to stop all this politics. And when his   mom  called the head, he did not even listen to the parents' concern and    disconnected the call. The college has been just ignoring all our    requests and has been forcing us to come back to college just for our    final exams, which have been online for the past 1.5 years. Also, the    college is not following the directive of the news guidelines laid down    by the Rajasthan government, which specifically says that parents'    permission is requested for students to come back to offline classes.    For our final exams, they are not asking for permission of any kind. In    addition, they have said that if it's not feasible for us to give our    exams right now, then we can give the exams in January, when, again,    nobody knows what the situation will be and final year students will    have their internships at that point which in turn again is meaningless    and illogical.\n\nI am attaching    videos from our hostel(Dated 24th November), flouting norms and forcing    us to come back to fill their pockets, not listening to our requests   and  threatening us. I have made this account solely for the purpose of    writing this post anonymously because I am scared that they will be    using this to take action against me. They are taking away our freedom    of speech. Due to the recent spike in cases and the imminent threat of a    new wave, our college is just focused on one thing alone(image and    money). The Rajasthan government has also stated that if any case is    found in any institution, that institution will be closed for ten days;    if this occurs, and something happens to any student as a result of    this, the administration will accept responsibility.\n\nI    urge you to please help us and stop this injustice. I am attaching  our   twitter moment and hope you can help us trend our movement against   this  injustice. It would be great if you guys could spread this news  in  the  media too. Recently, in Karnataka, medical students, all fully    vaccinated, have contracted COVID (281 students and counting) and now    they have closed the college and declared it a contained zone. This  goes   to show what is going to happen, and colleges right now in India  have   taken prudent and wise decisions and are conducting exams online.  While   our college is threatening free speech and forcing us to  contract  COVID  while not following government guidelines.\n\nPlease find the videos, one of the latest email sent as attachments.

      <li>Title::: 'How do we stop the weirdos from further ruining our image/reputation?'<br />Body: '# We Desis have a lot of negative stereotypes and very few positive ones. How do we break them?\n\n**Individual Level:** We can work on ourselves and as individuals differentiate ourselves from the rest of the weirdos but it won\'t help the image of our race as a whole. We will only be seen as "one of the good ones"\n\n* **The Street Shitter:** It\'s up to the government to fix the sanitation and overpopulation issue.\n* **Casteist:** This one mostly applies to the mainland and is again up to to the government to fix.\n* **Open Bob and Vagene:** There a lot of innocent mainlanders, fobs and ABCDs who get wrongfully stereotyped online and irl.  So my question is how do we stop/educate the creeps from harassing women online and sending them creepy messages?\n\n(I actually made a catfish account just to see if the Bobs and Vagene stereotype was as bad as the people make it out to be and sadly it was. I got hundred of followers, all of them mainlanders and even got dozens of DMs from them)\n\nThese people are either unaware of the memes that are made on them or are aware and choose not to care. Shaming them doesn\'t seem to work. So how do we stop them from doing this shit and further enforcing the stereotype?\n\n* **Tech Support Scammer and the Indian Accent:** The Indian government/police doesn\'t seem to be taking any action against the scam centers. Westerners who have never met a Desi or have very limited exposure to Desis get annoying scam calls everyday which makes them generalize and hate us because of their very few experiences with Indians being bad ones and in their opinion makes it okay to generalize and be racist towards us. And the reason the Indian Accent is hated is because most scammers have a thick Indian accent.\n\n*So what can we do?*\n\nAlso, please none of the same BS about Soft power or self improvement. Soft power might boost our SMV a little but it won\'t help much unless we break these stereotypes first.

      <li>Title::: 'Lyricist Anand Bakshi‚Äôs Filmfare Interview from 2000'<br />Body: 'His name unspools vignettes of tenderly written numbers like *Chingari koi bhadke (Amar Prem), Saawan ka mahina (Milan), Bindiya chamkegi (Do Raaste), Main shayar to nahin (Bobby), Woh kya hai (Anuraag), Khilona jaan kar (Khilona), Teri pehli nazar ko salaam (Ek Duje ke liye)* and more recently *Tujhe dekha toh (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), Le gayi, le gayi (Dil To Pagal Hai), Taal se taal mila (Taal)*, in your mind. And like the Everready batteries, he‚Äôs still charged. And raring to go. Long after the others have fallen by the wayside.\n\n**With over 4000 songs under his belt, 38 Filmfare nominations, four Filmfare Awards in a career spanning 45 years, his is no mean achievement. At 70, Anand Bakshi‚Äôs certainly the most prolific lyricist of our times.**\n\nIt all began in Rawalpindi during pre-partition. Cinema was still a nascent medium. Anand Bakshi reminisces, ‚ÄúThere were times when I would sell my books in order to buy a movie ticket. My parents would scold me. But that never stopped me. I dreamt of coming to Bombay and doing something in films. Though I wasn‚Äôt clear what.‚Äù His natural talent for music made him popular among his friends. He‚Äôd entertain them by singing film, Punjabi folk songs and ghazals. But contrary to his literary image, Anand Bakshi studied only upto the eighth standard. ‚ÄúThe situation were such that I had to drop out,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúI have no formal training in writing songs.‚Äù\n\nAfter serving the army for 2-3 years, Bakshi chucked it all up to come to Bombay in 1952. After three years of fruitless struggle, a depressed Bakshi returned to his old job: the army. ‚ÄúBut I was restless,‚Äù says Anand Bakshi. ‚ÄúSo after three years, I came back to Bombay once again. By then I‚Äôd married and had a daughter. My wife and my parents thought I was simply wasting my time. They told me to stop dreaming and to concentrate on my job. But I was adamant.‚Äù\n\nIn Bombay, Bakshi once again began his struggle, meeting people, hopping from one studio to another. To make matters worse his money was over in about three months. ‚Äù I was at the end of my tether,‚Äù he grins today. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to do. I thought I should return home. But I was embarrassed to do so. What would my family say?‚Äù\n\nSoon his struggle bore fruit. Bakshi heard that Bhagawan Dada was launching a film, *Bhala Aadmi*. ‚ÄúI went to his office at Dadar,‚Äù Bakshi flashbacks. ‚ÄúI told him I was a song writer. Right away he told me to write four songs. I was paid Rs 150 for those songs. It was a whopping sum those days.‚Äù The listless days however continued. And then one day Sunil Dutt, who happened to be a distant relative, send Bakshi to Raj Kapoor with a letter. But Raj Kapoor already had an established team of writers in Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri. Bakshi narrates, ‚ÄúHis assistant Hiren Kheda told me that Raj Kapoor wouldn‚Äôt be interested in me. But if he ever made a film, he would definitely give me a chance. Soon he turned producer with *Mehndi Lagi Mere Haath*. And I wrote the lyrics.‚Äù\n\nTalking some more about his struggling days, Anand Bakshi remebers the day he met music director Roshan at Filmistan studio. ‚ÄúI still hadn‚Äôt made my mark then. He asked me to meet him the next day. That night it rained very heavily. I haven‚Äôt seen such rain in my 45 years in Bombay. There were no trains. And I couldn‚Äôt afford a taxi. I was worried how to reach there. So I calculated the time it would me to reach Filmistan by foot from Dadar. I left four hours early the next day. When I reached Filmistan, Roshan saab was surprised to see me. He said it wasn‚Äôt important enough to go through so much trouble. I said it wasn‚Äôt important for him but it was very important for me to get work. I did *CID Girl* with Roshan saab.‚Äù\n\nSoon word spread about the new writer on the block. He bagged films like *Jab Jab Phool Khile, Milan, Do Raaste, Amar Prem, Roti, Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki, Seeta Aur Geeta, Anokhi Ada, Daag, Mera Gaon Mera Desh*. Films which went onto become jubilee hits at the box office. And in partnership with music direcotrs like Laxmikant-Pyarelal and R.D. Burman, Anand Bakshi slalomed to the big league. Bakshi states that he‚Äôs worked very hard to reach where he has. ‚ÄúRemember, we had stalwart writers like Sahir Ludhianvi, Shailendra, Hasrat Jaipuri, Kaifi Azmi, Majrooh Sultanpuri. Whereas I hadn‚Äôt even passed my tenth standard. I used to get scared to write. Naturally, I had to work hard to prove myself. But there was healthy competition in those days. Sahir used to help me a lot. Even Shailendra encouraged me. He‚Äôd introduce me around. I remember he even asked me to write a qawwali in one of his films.‚Äù\n\nBut his sweetest memory is of Raj Kapoor coming to his house to sign him for *Bobby*. ‚ÄúI was thrilled,‚Äù he smiles. ‚ÄúHe invited L-P and me for a story narration. On our way, I asked Laxmikant- Pyarelal whether Bobby was a girl or a boy. I‚Äôd written a song, ‚ÄòHum tum ek kamre mein bandh hon‚Äô. When Raj Kapoor heard the song, he thought it would fit both the hero and the heroine.‚Äù So many anecdotes fill the air. Prod him and he mentions the time Raj Khosla explained a situation in *Mera Gaon Mera Desh*, where the hero is tied. The heroine wants to rescue the hero. ‚ÄúAt once the dialogue between Alexander, the great and King Puru flashed in my mind. Alexander asks him, `tumhare saath kya sulook kiya jaye.‚Äô I got my song *Maar diya jaye ya chhod diya jaye*.‚Äù *Achha to hum chalte hain (Aan Milo Sajana)* came after hours of futile discussions with Laxmikant-Pyarelal. When he still couldn‚Äôt figure what to write, Bakshi got up and said, *"Achcha to hum chalte hain"*. Laxmikant asked, *‚Äúphir kab miloge?"* And lo! the song was born.\n\nFor *Bairaag*, he‚Äôd written a beautiful number for the blind Dilip Kumar. But the director Asit Sen didn‚Äôt like it. When Shakti Samanta heard it, he jumped at it. He used the *Woh kya hai*  song on Moshumi Chatterji in *Anuraag*. Similarly the song *Maine poochha chand se*, composed by S.D. Burman was written for Ramesh Sehgal‚Äôs film. But it never got made. Later son R. D. Burman recorded it for Sanjay Khan‚Äôs *Abdullah*. Says Bakshi, ‚ÄúThere are about 200-300 songs of mine which haven‚Äôt been used. They were recorded but the films never got made. They are rotting on the cans somewhere. Who knows?‚Äù He mentions *Chingari koi bhadke (Amar Prem)* as his fave song. ‚ÄúThat song wasn‚Äôt written for any film. One evening I was sitting and the words just flowed. When Shakti Samanta and Rajesh Khanna heard it, they wanted it for the film.‚Äù\n\nBesides penning songs Anand Bakshi has also lend his voice to a few numbers. He sang *Baagon mein baahar aayi* with Lata Mangeshkar for *Mom ki Gudia*. He also sang a qawwali for *Sholay*. ‚ÄúBut unfortunately it was deleted from the film,‚Äù he laughs. Talks veers to today‚Äôs abysmal quality of films and lyrics. And he sighs, ‚ÄúEven the stories have changed so much. Those days the stories used to have so much depth. Now it‚Äôs all so superficial. There‚Äôs no romance left in the movies. All the hero and the heroine do is dance in the name of romance. Can you believe that I haven‚Äôt written a single sad song in years now. That‚Äôs because sad songs don‚Äôt fit in today‚Äôs milieu. No one wants to watch tragedies these days.‚Äù\n\nHe rues the fact that the quality of lyrics too has deteriorated over the years. ‚ÄúIt reflects the time we live in,‚Äù he reasons. ‚ÄúI shudder when I hear certain lyrics. The grammar is all wrong. Writers use all the wrong words. But the audience accepts it because they don‚Äôt know any better.‚Äù He remembers how films went onto become jubilee hits in the good ole days. ‚ÄúI got a special suit made for the silver jubilee of *Milan*. It was such a big occasion for us,‚Äù he smiles. ‚Äù *Farz* ran for 100 weeks. So did the other films. Today if a film runs for 25 weeks, your must count your blessings.‚Äù Clearly, his magic touch remains unsullied. ‚ÄúI guess my familiarity with Indian folk music has helped me a lot,‚Äù he says explaining his sucess run. ‚ÄúEven after so many years, when I sit to write a song, I feel I won‚Äôt be able to deliver. Suddenly I get all knotted up. The fear that I won‚Äôt be able to do it drives me.‚Äù\n\nFinally he says, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it amazing that I‚Äôve worked with generations of music directors. I‚Äôve worked with Roshan and his son Rajesh Roshan, Chitragupt and his sons Anand-Milind. I still feel young at heart. I can never tire of writing. I‚Äôm amused when people ask me how I continue to write romantic songs. Arre bhai writing is like breathing to me. It comes naturally.‚Äù\n\nSo saying, he gets up and walks towards his study. And the words are ready to flow once again.'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'r45tih'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r45tih/lyricist_anand_bakshis_filmfare_interview_from/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Indian 'Peace Keeping Force' and its forgotten crimes against the Sri Lankan Tamils"<br />Body: '*Before I make this post, I want to emphasize that the post is to bring awareness about an event in history that isn\'t often discussed in mainstream Indian politics. For the sake of raising awareness, I ask that you share this post and engage with the content; thank you*\n\n**\\[WARNING: LONG POST BELOW\\]**\n\nThe Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was part of the Indian Military that had been operating in the largely Northern province of Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990, with the goal of ending conflict between the Tamil militant groups and the Sri Lankan State. However, the IPKF became engaged in a war with the LTTE, after the LTTE had accused the IPKF of allowing LTTE soldiers to die in Sri Lankan State\'s custody. This conflict created a bloody history in which the Indian forces had largely committed rapes and mass murders against Tamil civilians.\n\nBefore I delve into further details, the heinous crimes that the IPKF had committed had been condemned by Anura Bandaranaike who was the Opposition Leader at the time and even Prime Minister Premadasa had been moved to get the IPKF out of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Jaffna Hospital was a situation in which on Divali, the IPKF had stormed the Jaffna Hospital and began the systematic killing of civilians, doctors and nurses (roughly 60-70 people), who they had suspected to be colluding with the LTTE. To ruthlessly and wantonly kill innocent medical personnel and patients in a hospital is beyond cruel.\n\nThe Valvettiturai massacre was considered \'India\'s Mai Lai\' in reference to the horrors that the US had done in Vietnam. Roughly 60 civilians had died and it is one of the many cases where India had largely enacted cruel treatment onto the Tamil people\n\nThe Jaffna Hospital massacre was one of the many crimes that this group had committed and the goal of this post to spark discussion rather than highlight every crime that took place during this time; in fact, the majority of soldiers hailed from Northern India (Punjab, Haryana), lands characterized for it\'s horrendous treatment of women. This period of Indian occupation had resulted in the sexual assault against numerous Tamil women of varying ages. To avoid posting grotesque details, I ask those to have a visit either to the Instagram account mentioned earlier or to the following Wikipedia article:\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\\_Peace\\_Keeping\\_Force#Sexual\\_violence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Peace_Keeping_Force#Sexual_violence)\n\n[https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Indian-Peace-Keeping-Force-actually-responsible-for-human-rights-violations-in-Sri-Lanka](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Indian-Peace-Keeping-Force-actually-responsible-for-human-rights-violations-in-Sri-Lanka) (this is from Quora and the answer by Samantha Ekayanake provides great detail)\n\nFor those that may not view Wikipedia as a reliable source, many of these accounts are corroborated in Rajan Hoole\'s \'Broken Palmyara\' which discusses the crimes that the IPKF had committed in the North. Also, these are mentioned in these sources as well:\n\n\\- Amnesty International, Amnesty International Statement On The Situation in Sri Lanka With Respect To The Return of Tamils to Sri Lanka (London: Amnesty International, 1988), p. 2\n\n\\- William Maclean, "Civilians risk gantlet of guns to flee Tamil city", Globe and Mail (26 October 1989)\n\n\\- [https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/asa370301990en.pdf](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/asa370301990en.pdf) (Lists the disappearances done by IPKF)\n\n\\- [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T01058R000406330001-0.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T01058R000406330001-0.pdf) (CIA File that discusses Rajiv Gandhi\'s attempt to exert Indian hegemony on Sri Lanka)\n\n\\- [https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/87NEWDELHI23722\\_a.html](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/87NEWDELHI23722_a.html) (Wiki Leaks cable detailing LTTE and IPKF Clashes)\n\nThis period was so horrendous that even both the TamilNet and SinhalaNet sites, which are characterized for their more \'colorful\' views, are in agreement with the crimes that have taken place during this period.'<br />Author: 'RohanG1991'  id: 'r3w5ew'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r3w5ew/indian_peace_keeping_force_and_its_forgotten/</li>

With a workforce of nearly 1.3 million,  it is also one of the largest employers in the world.\n\n# FOR\n\n**Indian Railways**  **recovers only 53 per cent of the cost of a ticket from a passenger,  which puts additional pressure on the network in terms of earnings. The remaining 47 per cent is given as subsidy to the passengers.**\n\n The Indian railways are subsidised **by around Rs 400 billion ($5.8 billion)**, of which around 60% goes to commuter rail and short-haul trips. \n\nIt is high time we privatise India Railways , large subsidies and low quality of service has to end.\n\n Privatisation will lead to cost rationalisations and we will begin  to see freight rates dropping. Railway transportation should be cheaper  than trucking but high cost and service that requires further  improvement, has pushed cargo to trucking, increasing logistics costs in  the country and also increasing pollution. We strongly believe that  privatisation will mitigate these issues\n\nPrivatisation  will increase the levels of investment, performance, and customer satisfaction while reducing the cost to the taxpayer through rail subsidies \n\n  *‚ÄúWe want railways to drive India‚Äôs growth story.

We have no accountability for the Judiciary. No decision taken by the courts can be criticized in public, lest our Judicial master deem it to be the contempt of court. Their decisions cannot be reviewed by anyone other than themselves. We have been a democratic republic for the past 70 years and yet the common public is still at the mercy of what cases our Mi lord deem to be worthy of judgement. \n\nWe are told that there are three pillars of Indian Democracy:\n\n1. Executive\n2. Legislative\n3. Judiciary\n\nBut sadly that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. While the first two pillars of our Democracy can be loosely termed as for the people, by the people, the third fails to be so on so many accounts. Consider the scenario of appointment of our Judiciary, The Chief Justice of India. Theoretically CJI is elected by the collegium of Supreme Court Justices, who pass their nominations to the Prime Minister, who then suggests it to the President. Practically, there have been only 2 cases where CJI has been anyone other than the senior most judge of the Supreme Court. \\[1\\] Consider the election of judges for the subordinate courts, these are appointed on the recommendation of the CJ of the High Court of the corresponding state. \n\nAccountability is the sine qua non of democracy. Transparency facilitates accountability. The Indian Judiciary fails on all counts of accountability. The only process by which a Supreme Court/High Court Judge can be removed is by \n\n‚ÄúPresident can remove a judge on proved misbehavior or incapacity when parliament approves with a majority of the total membership of each house in favor of impeachment and not less than two thirds of the members of each house present‚Äù \\[2\\]\n\nAgain, practically there has been only a single attempt at impeachment, and that also failed.\n\n‚ÄúA district judge or additional judge may be removed from his office by the governor on conformation from the high court collegium.‚Äù \\[3\\]\n\nOur Judiciary is a slow moving machinery where each part is reluctant to change. The cases are piling up, while there are more than 30% vacancies in numerous district courts. All the administrative decisions come under the District/Session Judge for Lower Courts. There have been numerous recommendations to streamline the process of hiring and appointment of Judiciary Officers through Centralised Service, All India Judicial Service, but the first recommendation was done in 1958. \n\nWe are in a Judicial nightmare.

The state that is featured in this series is Odisha.\n\nOdisha is a state that has not been in the spotlight for many years. In fact, Odisha Tourism tagline itself is India's Best Kept Secret.\n\nOdisha Tourism: [https://odishatourism.gov.in/content/tourism/en.html](https://odishatourism.gov.in/content/tourism/en.html)\n\nCheck out this interactive map from Chief Minister Office: [https://cm.odisha.gov.in/map](https://cm.odisha.gov.in/map)\n\n[https://www.mapsofworld.com/india/orissa/](https://preview.redd.it/vvup7fmoad081.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84671bac6356760f4aae7ae1d5020d6188abf64b)\n\n[https://gisodisha.nic.in/Statem/District.pdf](https://gisodisha.nic.in/Statem/District.pdf)\n\nSo let's get with some basic facts about the state:\n\n**Physical Geography:**\n\nIt was the first state to get independent and celebrates Utkala Dibasa and is celebrated on 1 April 1936.\n\nOdisha lies between the latitudes 17.780N and 22.730N, and between longitudes 81.37E and 87.53E. The state has an area of 155,707 km2, which is 4.87% of total area of India, and a coastline of 450 km. In the eastern part of the state lies the coastal plain. It extends from the Subarnarekha River in the north to the Rushikulya river in the south. The lake Chilika is part of the coastal plains. The plains are rich in fertile silt deposited by the six major rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal: Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Baitarani, Brahmani, Mahanadi and Rushikulya. The Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), a Food and Agriculture Organization-recognised rice gene bank and research institute, is situated on the banks of Mahanadi in Cuttack. The stretch between Puri and Bhadrak in Odisha juts out a little into the sea, making it vulnerable to any cyclonic activity.\n\nThree-quarters of the state is covered in mountain ranges. Deep and broad valleys have been made in them by rivers. These valleys have fertile soil and are densely populated. Odisha also has plateaus and rolling uplands, which have lower elevation than the plateaus. The highest point in the state is [Deomali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deomali_(mountain)) at 1,672 metres in Koraput district. Some other high peaks are: Sinkaram (1,620 m), Golikoda (1,617 m), and Yendrika (1,582 metres).\n\n [https://www.ibef.org/states/odisha.aspx](https://www.ibef.org/states/odisha.aspx)\n\nAs it is closer to Bay Of Bengal, it is prone to natural calamities. Odisha has been by over 100 cyclones between 1891 and 2021. One of the worst cyclone to hit Odisha was in 1999. [Number of Cyclones](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cyclone-yaas-how-odisha-s-model-of-disaster-preparedness-came-into-being-101621969683964-amp.html)\n\nOdisha is India‚Äôs main industrial hub where 35% of natural resources are found in the state itself. It has significant reserves of iron ore, bauxite, nickel, coal, etc.\n\nThe major cities are Rourkela, Sambalpur, Cuttack, Angul , Baripada, Balasore, Brahmpur, and Bhubaneswar. Paradip Port also is the biggest port. There were several textile Mills and paper Mills which have closed down unfortunately.\n\nBhubaneswar is actually one of the first planned city in India along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh and was designed by Otto K√∂nigsberger. (Wikipedia)\n\nKnown for having the tags : Best Smart City, Sports Capital of India, Industrial Hub of India, Steel Hub of India, many others.\n\nSo many people think Odisha is poor. Are we poor? Actually the answer is no. Living conditions have improved a lot, infrastructure is scaling up (of course at snail pace, aram se bhai), various schemes by BJD has been helping people to a certain extent. ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14791854/2021/21/2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14791854/2021/21/2))\n\nOdisha has two airports operational: one international airport (Biju Patnaik International Airport), Jharsguda and two upcoming airports at Rourkela and Jeypore.\n\nHowever, Odisha is still lagging on some aspects of the infrastructure which Shri Narendra Modi govt is focusing on. That is why they roped in Ashwini Vaishnaw to be Minister for Railways and Minister for Electronics and Telecommunications, Communications so that he can improve the rail connectivity and Internet connectivity.\n\nOdisha has India's missile testing centre at Chandipur, Odisha where successful missiles have been fired.\n\n**What can you tell us:**\n\nSome are from : [https://www.utkaltoday.com/amazing-facts-odisha/](https://www.utkaltoday.com/amazing-facts-odisha/)\n\n**Political**\n\nBiju Janta Dal has been ruling the state since 5 March 2000. Naveen Patnaik has been serving the state for more than 5 terms , about 21 terms. He is one of the longest serving Chief Minister and has been undefeated. Even longer than Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBiju Janta Dal was founded by Naveen Patnaik who is the son of former Chief Minister Biju Patnaik. Biju Patnaik was the Chief Minister of Odisha from 1961 to 1963 &amp; 1990 to 1995. He was known to be a trusted ally of Nehru but eventually something went north. Biju Patnaik was a pilot. His skills came in handy when he went to Indonesia with his Dakota plane to rescue former Indonesia Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir and President Sukarno, Vice-President Hatta. When he died, he was wrapped with three flags: Indonesia, USSR &amp; India.

Odissi originated from Odisha only.\n\nOdissi dance, one of the oldest forms of classical dance in India, traces its origins to Natya Shastra- the sacred Sanskrit text on performing arts. It evolved further on receiving royal patronage.\xa0The carvings found at the Udayagiri Monastery denote that Odissi was patronised as early as 2nd\xa0Century BCE and the trend continued unabated till about the 16th Century AD. Odissi dance form can be broken down to the movement of the head, bust and torso and the accompanying gestures and expressions. The soulful expressions accompanied by graceful gestures and deft movements punctuated with intermittent moments of stillness appropriates watching Odissi Dance to ‚ÄúPoetry in Motion‚Äù.\n\nSambalpuri Folk Dance is also very popular. In fact, Rangabati originated from Western Odisha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Sambalpuri Folk Dance \\(https:\\/\\/apps.odishatourism.gov.in\\/folk-dance\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4o6b38u6yo181.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be384b9742d6e1239862c4a2e5f3706e7d3506f1)\n\n **Language**\n\nCurrently, there are 38 million Odia speakers.

This effectively ends the monopolies of majority state owned power distribution companies. A very big step, but let's hope this does not see unreasonable protests. \n\nThis step is highly required since the dependency on electricity is going to increase, considering the cooking industry may also switch to electric cooking, along with electric cars and other electric equipment.

On the other hand, countries such as China and Brazil seem to have virtually no serious hunger nowadays; in some cases, they even do better than the US now. While things have improved for India in recent years, it still sticks out badly on world maps which shows this.\n\nBut what exactly causes India to have so much hunger, despite there not being a serious famine or food shortage for over 50 years, or food distribution issues being at least as bad in many other countries with lower malnutrition rates?

So, I bought leaves and dried them and [made powder](https://i.imgur.com/2QitTfh.jpg). Last evening I used these leaves to make Sambar and by god, it was dammed good. I\'ve used ~ 2x times the Sambar powder.\n\nI have my own story of struggles of making perfect sambar. I\'ve written it elsewhere and sharing it with you.\n\n---\n\nI have my own personal story on Sambar. I never liked it. But there is one restaurant in Tirupati I had Idly Sambar and it blew my brains. I still have memory of that experience. Samajh lo ki mera Sambar ka virginity nikal gaya. Now I was hungry for Sambar. Later on when I started to cook at my home, whenever I tried making sambar it didn\'t turn out right.\n\nThere is one small \'theka\' near my house where she makes really good sambar. I am her regular customer. So I asked her how to make sambar like she does. Here I should mention that I tried out all methods that are usually found on internet and I followed it to the dot but could get the flavor. Meanwhile whenever I felt like having, I used to drive all the way to Tirupathi just to eat Idly Sambar and Sambar bada. So the lady told me that she uses Sambar powder from one particular shop in Tirupati and not the ones that come in packs.\n\nSo I took the address of the shop and next time when I was visiting Tirupati, I went to that place and bought 250 g of the powder. I asked him if he makes them in his shop. Well, he then narrated another amusing story of this sambar powder. Apparently most of the best restaurants don\'t use the regular packet sambars that we can buy. They use professional powder such as this. There is one mami in Mylapore, Chennai who makes this professional sambar powder and she exports it worldwide. I tried my hand at it again this time around it did come somewhat better but still far away from the mark. I thought I should watch the lady while she makes it. Anyway I didn\'t try asking her.\n\nAlso I asked my bua how to do it. She also makes good Sambar, much much better than how I do but the "oomph" of the restaurant is at next level. I tried learning from my bua but ...‡∞ú‡∞æ‡∞§‡∞ï‡∞Ç ‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞æ‡∞¨‡±ç‡∞≤‡∞Ç ‡∞Æ‡∞ø ‡∞§‡∞ø‡∞Ç‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞∏‡±ç . But I learnt do make good ‡∞™‡±Å‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞∏‡±Å.\n\nTwo weeks ago I had to visit Chennai on some errand and in free time I went to Mylapore. After having another round of Idly sambar in a small road side restaurant, I asked the guy if there is a place around where I can buy Sambar powder. He told me that there are a few and he gave me a recommendation that he likes and uses in his restaurant. And then I told him my problem with making Sambar and how I was failing. He called his cook to give me instructions. Later when I returned back I tried it again with new instructions. And by god, this time around it has come really good. As good as the one you get in Tirupathi restaurant. The key is actually to use haldi and mirch in equal proportions along with Sambar powder and more tamarind juice. Also add a bit of sugar. That changes everything. I was able to reproduce this consistently few times.

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Empire || Ch 1: Takshashila Khanda || 1.9: Reductionism'<br />Body: '*‚ÄúTo keep a value more sacred than the truth is to dishonour the Goddess Sarasvati; to cut off a man\'s tongue is to point a sword at her throat.‚Äù*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/11/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**‚Äî1.9. Reductionism‚Äî**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*THE KAUTILYA LECTURES:*\n\n*‚ÄúTHE ELEMENTS OF SOVEREIGNITY‚Äù*\n\n*By Professor Chanakya.*\n\n*Delivered initially in the 156th year of Magadha hegemony at Taxila, Gandhara to the following students:* \n\n*- Apratimaujas a brahmana of Gokula, Shurasena*\n\n*- Dandasharman a brahmana of Ujjain, Malwa*\n\n*- Panini a brahmana of Salatura, Gandhara*\n\n*- Pabbata a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Chandragupta a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Shribhanu a kshatriya of Kundagrama, Vajji*\n\n*Transcribed later from memory by Shribhanu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara Nakshatra.*\n\n*Edited and organized at the word of Professor Chanakya by the Yavana lady Tara.* \n\nKanada, the preceptor of the *Vaisheshika* (Reductionist) philosophy, says that the study of the Physical Sciences begins with the enumeration of the elements that comprise matter. He lists these elements as being of six types: substances, qualities, activities, generality, particularity and relationship. From this through the methods of perception and inference alone, all other laws of science can be explained.\n\nSimilarly, to discover the laws of the science of government, one must list the elements of sovereignty.\n\nUsanas says that the king is the sovereign. Bharadvaja says that it is the minister. Visalaksha says that it is the country that is sovereign. Parasara and Kaunapadanta say that it is the army and the fort ‚Äì my own preceptor is sympathetic to this stance. Pisuna says that it is the treasury ‚Äì I too adopted this stance in my early days.\n\nBut none of these can be correct. In the game invented by Usanas, victory and loss depend entirely on the capture of the king; not so in real wars, for a king too can be sacrificed by a minister to win a war. The replacement or death of a minister is not as great a tragedy as the loss of a country to an enemy. The country alone cannot be sovereign, as we care about who rules it. And as for the army, the fort, the treasury ‚Äì if any of these were the sole guarantor of sovereignty, the soldier who guarded the treasury doors would be truly powerful.\n\nI will speak, more generally, of how order is established.\n\nThe guard of the treasury is loyal to the king because he thinks, ‚ÄúIf I steal from the treasury, I will be punished when my theft is exposed by the auditor‚Äù, and furthermore, that if he attempts to conspire with the auditor, the auditor will think ‚ÄúThe guard may be a spy for the king, this may be a ploy to test my honesty‚Äù. \n\nIf the guard and the auditor were of one mind, they could unite and conspire to steal the king‚Äôs wealth; if all the soldiers of a king were of one mind, they could unite and refuse to work for the king; if the vassals of an emperor were of one mind, they could unite and overthrow the emperor. But divided, they may be ruled.\n\nI shall provide, for the purpose of understanding, other examples of such phenomena as they occur.\n\nPrices are such a phenomena. Sellers, if they were capable of conspiring with each other, could set prices that were as high as they desired; however, if such a conspiracy were attempted, a seller would then think ‚Äúthe other seller may be a traitor, he may reduce his prices slightly one day and take all my clients for himself and increase his revenue manyfold‚Äù, and likewise the other seller. Or they may think ‚Äúthe other seller thinks as I do, and if I am capable of betrayal, so is he‚Äù. And so even the slightest rumour of dissension breaks the cartel that does not punish its traitors.\n\nLanguage is such a phenomena. Scythians, if they could all will alike, could speak Sanskrit and consequently speak and think with clarity as we do, and the effects of doing so would be beneficial to their economy. Yet each Scythian may think ‚ÄúIf I alone start speaking Sanskrit, none of my colleagues would understand me‚Äù, and there is thus no cause for any one Scythian to speak Sanskrit, even if there is reason for all Scythians together to do so.\n\nAnd sovereignty is such a phenomena. Even when a conspiracy against the king is profitable ‚Äì whether in the treasury, or in the army, or in the court, or by supporting enemy kings, each member must think ‚Äúthis conspiracy may be a ploy by the king to test me, and even if it is not, other members of it may choose to betray me for profit, thus I should betray it for profit first‚Äù.\n\nSuch is the nature of man: every decision is made by the will of one man, not by many together. \n\nThus it is a fallacy to make statements like ‚ÄúThe rich do such things because it benefits them‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Brahmins do such things because it benefits them‚Äù. For while the behaviour of individuals may serve their interests, the behaviour of groups lacking in unity seldom does.\n\nAnd thus the art of statecraft is the art of making alliances, so that it becomes profitable for each of its members to be loyal to the king, even if it would not have been profitable if they were lacking in unity. \n\nThus there are seven elements of sovereignty: the king, the minister, the country, the treasury, the army, the fort, and the ally, and the successful exercise of statecraft lies in binding these elements together through the art of alliance-making.\n\n‚ÄúProfessor,‚Äù asks Apratimaujas, ‚ÄúWould this be a correct summary of your teaching? To exercise governance, it is necessary to have command over a large number of people, for if you have command only over a small number of people, they will have no cause to be loyal to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúContinue under that assumption,‚Äù Chanakya directs.\n\n‚ÄúHow, then, is an alliance ever defeated, or a new state ever established? It seems to me that in the absence of other allies being loyal, an ally has no cause to be loyal, and the same applies to each of those allies, and so on. It appears to be the same problem as that of teaching Sanskrit to Scythians.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI will say three things,‚Äù says Chanakya, ‚ÄúFirstly, kings may not have successfully instituted such a system as would instil loyalty, and such vulnerabilities may be exploited. Second, it is possible to ally with an existing powerful state against another powerful state, so it is not necessarily the case that you start with having *no one* as your ally. Third, there are methods to create loyalty among large numbers of people at once. But more generally, the question you‚Äôre raising is known as the problem of *war*.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*THE KAUTILYA LECTURES:*\n\n*‚ÄúTHE CAUSES FOR WAR‚Äù*\n\n*By Professor Chanakya.*\n\n*Delivered initially in the 156th year of Magadha hegemony at Taxila, Gandhara to the following students:* \n\n*- Apratimaujas a brahmana of Gokula, Shurasena*\n\n*- Dandasharman a brahmana of Ujjain, Malwa*\n\n*- Panini a brahmana of Salatura, Gandhara*\n\n*- Pabbata a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Chandragupta a kshatriya of Pataliputra, Magadha*\n\n*- Shribhanu a kshatriya of Kundagrama, Vajji*\n\n*Transcribed later from memory by Shribhanu for the benefit of the Yavana girl Tara Nakshatra.*\n\n*Edited and organized at the word of Professor Chanakya by the Yavana lady Tara.* \n\n‚ÄúWhat is the objective of war?‚Äù asks Chanakya.\n\n‚ÄúTo acquire more power,‚Äù Pabbata answers. \n\n‚ÄúAnd what such powers are acquired by war?‚Äù asks Chanakya.\n\n‚ÄúThe power to tax,‚Äù suggests Pabbata.\n\n‚ÄúTo improve the conquered country by enforcing security, eradicating wild tribes and such,‚Äù suggests Dandasharman.\n\n‚ÄúOr by creating academies and granting uncultivated lands to Brahmins for cultivation,‚Äù suggests Panini.\n\n‚ÄúOr by improving the judicial system and outlawing wicked practices in the conquered country,‚Äù suggests Chandragupta. \n\nA conqueror may possess many goals, including taxation, enactment of better laws in the conquered land, protection or formation of trade networks, or control over locations of strategic importance such as to protect one‚Äôs country from invasion or to clear a path for one‚Äôs army to conquer the country beyond the conquered country. For all these goals, the conqueror requires the loyalties of men in the enemy‚Äôs country; thus in general terms the goal of the conqueror is to be able to *govern* the conquered country.\n\nSometimes this loyalty amounts to accepting the conquered king as a vassal, or in some cases even deposing him entirely, and governing the conquered country as a province of one‚Äôs own. But sometimes all that is desired is a trade treaty, or the protection of trade routes, or the installation of a ruler more friendly to the conqueror‚Äôs interests.\n\nMuch as one starts with the definition of the elements to explain the laws of science, one must start from the definition of war to explain the tactics of war. The term war invokes images of battles and expeditions, but the definition is far more general. For example, it also includes a coup or a civil war, or a war fought through deception alone.\n\nThe efforts taken to acquire some article in the sense of exercising right over it ‚Äì a country, a route, a fort, port or strategic position, a water source, some loot, slaves, a woman or several, honour and glory ‚Äì is termed war. \n\nSome of these causes are just; others are not. \n\nThose that impede such efforts are termed enemies. \n\n‚ÄúI have heard the term *Chakravarti* used to refer to an emperor who rules all of the civilized world,‚Äù says Chandragupta, ‚ÄúIs that a just cause for war as well?‚Äù\n\nChanakya declines to answer that question.\n\nI shall now discuss the means of waging war. \n\n‚ÄúSuppose that I wished to acquire the country of Malwa for the right to tax it,‚Äù says Chanakya, ‚ÄúAt the very least, I would need to send a messenger to their tax collectors to send their taxes to me instead of to their king. What would happen then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be laughed at,‚Äù says Pabbata.\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, for they have no reason to comply. Suppose that I threatened to execute them if they didn‚Äôt comply, or if I offered them a salary to comply. What would happen then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôd still be laughed at, if you are known to have no means of following up on your word. But if you do follow up on your word, the king of Ujjain would capture and punish you for your crime.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOr at least, they will punish whichever agents I send to carry out these activities. So the king of Ujjain is doing something I do not wish him to do. What do I do when I wish to change someone‚Äôs behaviour to my liking?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThe doctrine of *sama-dama-danda-bheda* (persuasion, purchase, punishment, deceit),‚Äù Shribhanu recalled. ‚ÄúYou will employ these means to cause the king of Ujjain to do your bidding.‚Äù\n\nPabbata smirks. ‚ÄúGood luck with that. The king of Ujjain is a viceroy of Magadha.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThese discussions are theoretical,‚Äù says Chanakya sternly. ‚ÄúCan you tell me which of these four methods I will use, and how?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou could hardly *persuade* the king or the tax collectors to pay you taxes,‚Äù says Panini, ‚ÄúBribing someone to give you money hardly sounds sensible. I suppose you could deceive them by bribing some cart drivers and border guards‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRecall that I am not merely attempting a one-time plunder,‚Äù says Chanakya, ‚ÄúI wish to have the *right* to tax the land, as recognized by its people, so that I can do so unopposed and peacefully.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou would punish the king of Ujjain,‚Äù said Dandasharman. ‚ÄúOr threaten him with punishment.‚Äù\n\nOne method of such punishment is assassination. Indeed, this is what has been constantly occurring in Magadha as we speak. Yet, the king may be too well-guarded to easily assassinate, or the king‚Äôs ministers may have decision-making power, and they may not care so much about the health of the king as they do of the health of the country. Or I may be worried of the king attempting a counter-assassination on myself, and for a king endowed with wealth, that may have a greater chance of success.\n\nThus I wish to harass the country of Malwa in order to have them do my bidding. \n\nWhat is the best way to harass a country?\n\nThere are two forms of harassment: generic harassment, with the understanding that it will stop if they submit to my will, or targeted harassment, that specifically punishes the action that I wish to forbid. The latter is preferable if I only wish to conquer a portion of their country, or if I wish to force them into accepting a treaty on trade and such; the former is preferable if I wish to conquer their entire country.\n\nGeneric harassment takes many forms: assassinations and kidnappings of important officials, robbing treasuries, capturing territories other than the desired one as hostage, destructive acts such as burning countries, plundering cities and poisoning water sources, blocking of trade routes and food supplies. \n\nTargeted harassment involves battles. Battle may emerge between the army I send to rob their treasuries and the army they send in defence of it, and then such battles may escalate as each side sends reinforcements. Such battles are to be avoided, as they are unplanned ‚Äì instead, the conqueror must plan in advance and send an army of the size and composition that will eventually be needed. Secretive methods may also be employed to aid a battle.\n\nWhen the costs the conqueror imposes through these methods exceeds the costs of surrender for the defender, the conqueror wins.\n\nAn expedition should only be undertaken if its expected profit ‚Äì from gathered taxes and loot, concern for the welfare of the conquered people, precautionary cause, strategic cause ‚Äì exceeds its costs.\n\nThus, a war whose outcome is known in advance to both sides should never be fought.\n\nThus, all warfare is deception.\n\nTo harass a country ‚Äì plunder its cities, burn its fields, capture its leaders, and so on ‚Äì one needs to place an army in the midst of that country. Routes are too easily blocked, and mobilizing armies is costly and time-consuming, thus the necessity to establish or capture forts. Similarly, a defender needs forts to mobilize one‚Äôs army more easily, and to be able to pinch direct attacks in the centre of the country. For one large lion can be fought, but it is much harder to fight a pack of wolves that surrounds you on all sides. \n\nA defender may judge that instead of retreating to a fort, he may defeat the attacker‚Äôs army in battle before it reaches the fort. This may be advised if the defender can find a location for battle that favours him, such as a river crossing or certain terrain, as these act as forts of their own sorts. But forts are preferred, as they can be designed by men to function as desired, much as agriculture is desired to hunting and gathering fruits in the forest. Thus the conqueror should also establish military camps.\n\n‚ÄúI will pose to you a question,‚Äù says Chanakya, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt conquerors simply focus on capturing the capital through an assassination, rather than make extensive efforts to capture bordering cities and forts?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúKings tend to be well-guarded?‚Äù Dandasharman suggests.\n\n‚ÄúPabbata,‚Äù asks Chanakya, ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I were to assassinate Dhanananda?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou would quickly be executed by Sakadala, and Augraseniya would be appointed Emperor,‚Äù Pabbata answers.\n\n‚ÄúWhat if, instead of assassinating Dhanananda, I entered Magadha territory and somehow raised a local army and laid siege to Pataliputra?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen the surrounding forts loyal to the emperor would surround and destroy your army.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThose are similar outcomes,‚Äù Apratimaujas observes, ‚ÄúIf you attack the emperor, his allies within the palace will destroy you; if you attack the palace, the armies of the city will attack you; if you attack the city, the armies of the country will attack you; if you attack the country, the armies of the vassals will attack you; and if you attack the empire, the armies of the allies will attack you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo one must know where to attack from,‚Äù Chandragupta considers, ‚ÄúWeighing the quickness of a direct attack against the unopposed nature of an attack from the outside?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù says Chanakya, ‚ÄúAn attack from the inside must also fight all those who attempt to stop him, as must an attack from the outside. However, an attack from the inside may cause the conqueror to be more easily surrounded, and thus poses a strategic disadvantage in terms of positioning. Can anyone state the more general point I am trying to demonstrate?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat the conqueror‚Äôs victory depends on acquiring the loyalties of each of the defender‚Äôs elements of sovereignty,‚Äù says Apratimaujas, ‚ÄúThe allies‚Äô loyalties depend on their belief as to who will emerge victorious; yet your victory depends on the allies‚Äô loyalties.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is akin to the problem of teaching Sanskrit to the Scythians,‚Äù says Chandragupta.\n\n‚ÄúIt is akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy,‚Äù says Panini.\n\nIndeed, the art of war is the art of commanding the loyalties of the elements of sovereignty. There are many methods to do acquire the loyalties of the enemy‚Äôs elements.\n\nIf the conqueror already possesses a greater degree of sovereignty than the defender ‚Äì such as through a sufficiently larger army, wealthier treasury, larger or superior country, or a king and minister that govern with greater intellect ‚Äì then that alone is sufficient to acquire the elements, as the enemy is aware that an attempt to oppose the conqueror can be punished effectively by the conqueror.\n\nIf the conqueror is starting with little, then he must employ many cunning methods to acquire these elements. For example, he may pretend to have acquired an ally to acquire another ally, and vice versa to acquire the first ally. Or he may sow dissension within the enemy‚Äôs country to weaken the enemy‚Äôs command over his own elements, thus allowing even a weak king to conquer the country. Or he may take the support of a new ally entirely.\n\nSuch methods are diverse and require creativity, they cannot simply be taught through lecture. I will eventually, through the means of various games, teach you to independently suggest such methods when necessary.\n\nA particular method to create self-fulfilling prophecies is the manipulation of the enemy‚Äôs morale. This is the purpose of motivating an army through speeches, of demoralizing the enemy‚Äôs army, of slaying commanders, of planting flags on fortresses, of writing declarations of war and independence, of fabricating bad omens, of creating false genealogies and prophecies, of seeking verbal endorsement from distinguished Brahmins, and of performing the *Ashwamedha*\\[1\\] ritual. \n\nNo individual soldier needs to be motivated by the speech, yet the collective of all soldiers is motivated by it, as each individual soldier will think, ‚ÄúAs this king has given this speech, all my compatriots will be more loyal to him, and thus he has a greater chance of succeeding, and when he does succeed, I shall be rewarded if I am loyal to him now‚Äù, and all his compatriots think the same. Similarly, no enemy soldier needs to be superstitious for a bad omen to demoralize him, for he need only think ‚ÄúAll my compatriots will be demoralized by this bad omen, thus the enemy will win, thus I will benefit from betraying my king‚Äù, and all his compatriots think the same.\n\nThis is also why houses are built in accordance with the principles of *Vastu****\\[2\\]***, for each man thinks ‚ÄúIf I purchase a house not in accordance with such principles, no one will buy it from me‚Äù, and even if no one man believes in these principles, men will believe in it as a collective.\n\nI will make some comments on how such methods may be executed successfully.\n\nThe pronouncement of inspiring speeches can be compared to flirtations between a man and an unchaste woman. Each soldier is afraid to immediately proclaim his loyalty by crying ‚ÄúVictory to the Great King!‚Äù, as his compatriots may not share this feeling, and indeed they will not, as each of them thinks the same. Instead, he may express interest in the king‚Äôs words, put on an expression of high morale, breath and stand in an inspired manner, and applaud the king with a cry or through gestures, in that order, all as he observes similar signals from his compatriots. The process may also be aided by taking in confidence beforehand particular soldiers of decent repute to cry ‚ÄúVictory to the Great King!‚Äù in order to pressure their compatriots to do the same.\n\nThe key to turning loyalties is to make oneself distinguished in some way; it does not matter which way. For example, a relative of the king, the minister or general, a subjugated house or vassal state, an imprisoned or exiled king of an extinguished line all have a greater chance of conquering a country than does an ordinary man. People are also more likely to follow men distinguished by their wealth, scholarship, high birth and fame. That is why when a prince of a king may even conquer the capital directly, while an external king would likely fail in this mission unless he appoints a local governor as his vassal. \n\nOne way to avoid betrayal, whether intentional or by such tactics, is to associate with allies of good repute, such as ancient noble lines that will defend the honour of their word with their lives, or with mercenary clans of good repute, or with close and reliable friends with character that can be personally appraised. \n\nSimilarly to prevent attacks on his own army‚Äôs morale, a king must train his soldiers and other government servants to a protocol. This is known as ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù.\n\nWhen attacking a disciplined army, a conqueror must expose them to unexpected situations that they have not been trained a protocol for.\n\nThus each possible situation must be anticipated and effective protocols must be developed to be followed in these situations.\n\nTo develop the best counter-play to the enemy, a king must also gather information about the enemy, such as of the size and composition of his army, and the tactics he may employ. This is ascertained with scouts and spies. For example, the composition of one‚Äôs army must reflect what is needed to oppose the other‚Äôs army, such as the use of archers against infantry, and the use of cavalry against archers; as must the fortifications and location of battle. \n\nIf both parties had complete knowledge of the other‚Äôs army and sent the best army to oppose it, the result would be heavy bloodshed on both sides.\n\nThus all warfare is deception.\n\nDiscipline also has its disadvantages, as following orders may lead men off a cliff. Thus, per the needs of the situation, a king may employ mercenaries, or entertain his own soldiers as mercenaries by placing bounties on the achievement of certain goals, such as slaying a commander. Bounties on the achievement of greater goals, like seizing a fortress, may be offered to organized mercenary clans rather than to individual soldiers.\n\nFor completeness, I shall discuss the method of *Dharmayuddha****\\[3\\]***.\n\nIt is observed among some wild beasts that when they fight among themselves, they fight with their paws sheathed. Even though unsheathing their paws would allow them a greater chance to succeed, doing so will also prompt their enemy to unsheathe their paws, causing a great deal of destruction to both sides. Thus the beasts silently agree on certain rules of what is foul and what is not.\n\nSimilar observations can be made about pitched duels between princes.\n\nSimilar observations can be made about debates between scholarly Brahmins.\n\nSimilarly, two enemies may agree beforehand to fight on a particular battlefield at a specified time, to only bring certain weapons or an army of certain size to the fight, to obey certain rules during the battle, to surrender a predefined objective upon defeat in this battle, to not depose the defeated king but to reinstate him as ruler subject to certain acceptable conditions, and so on. Such rules are followed by clans in the interest of preserving their reputation.\n\nAs it is only kshatriya warriors who may be expected to uphold such rules, armies of vast numbers cannot be raised by employing peasant soldiers in such battles. Thus such battles cannot be fought against tribes such as the Scythians that conscript entire populations into their armies. Nor can such rules be followed while fighting against Western tribes whose army compositions are vastly different from those of civilized states, or against tribes that have no reputation to uphold, or against tribes of poor reputation. \n\nFollowing rules that your enemy doesn‚Äôt follow is suicide with extra steps.\n\nThus *Kutayuddha* is of great importance when fighting against barbarians.\n\nAs an exercise, you shall explain why states are nearly always contiguous, and what this entails for our assumptions about statecraft. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The king, the minister, the country, the fort, the treasury, the army and the ally are the elements of sovereignty.* \n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 6.1\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Which is better, a friend of vast population, or a friend of immense gold?

      <li>Title::: 'The Farm Laws and the recent extremism here.'<br />Body: "I am a sikh and a son of a farmer from Punjab.\n\nThe farm laws were unconstitutional. Also, they had some glaring issues that the farmers wanted the government to amend but that did not happen. So, the protests began.\n\n- The Essential commodities act amendment, a law that would allow hoarding to food grains by big corporates.. no one wants that. The common people couldn't understand what that could cause. The hoarding was observed in our history, before as well as after independence.\n\n- With no guarantee that the private companies would buy the grain at MSP, farmers feared that they will be taken advantage of by the companies. This was recently observed in Himachal Pradesh as done by the Adani group. They eliminated competition in previous years and now that only they are ones who will buy apples from the farmers, they reduced the buying price by a large margin. No farmer wants that. Adani group buys those apples at cheaper prices and puts them in cold storage. Then, they sell the apples at higher prices during off season. Both the consumer and the farmer suffer because of it.\n\nThe laws were not, in fact, there to benefit the farmers.\n\nNow, about the extremism.\n\nI watched a video about a politician claiming that Jats would have assassinated the PM if the laws were not repealed. I read the comments and was horrified at the accusations being thrown at sikhs.\n\nFirst of all. Not all sikhs are farmers and nor are all farmers, sikhs.\n\nThe Akal Takht is just a historical building and has no role in modern times. The only religious organization Sikhism has is the SGPC i.e. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committe. It manages the gurudwaras in northern states. Nothing else.\n\nNo one tells us what to do. We have our own free will. Also, we have common sense.\n\nA jatt is a sikh who is a farmer. Completely different from the Jats of Haryana. There are blacksmiths who work with metals, there are gold smiths who make jewelry. Likewise, there are sikhs who farm, called Jatts. \n\nJatt and Jat may mean the same but they are totally different people other than the fact that they are farmers.\n\nPolitics is web of lies, of deceit, of conflict, of strife, of greed, of corruption... Politicians thrive on conflict. That's how they get fame and votes. Take whatever they say with a grain of salt. Do not be fooled by them. They are great orators who know how to influence the masses with mere words. Think and make your own opinions only AFTER you know the FACTS.\n\nYes, sikh extremists exist. No one is perfect. Does that mean all sikhs are extremists? Hindu extremists also exist. Does that mean all hindus are extremists?\n\nI was horrified when I read those poison filled comments under that video. We are Indians. Our unity can't be that weak that an idiot like him could create such divide. \n\nNo, I refuse to believe that."<br />Author: 'manny0101-wn-wp-ffn'  id: 'r0gvz0'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/r0gvz0/the_farm_laws_and_the_recent_extremism_here/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'By what Authority? critical analysis of Social contract theory'<br />Body: "Who has the exclusive authority over our laws and us? The obvious and evident answer is\rthe government. So, what exclusive authority does government and its agents hold? Why do we see\r\na vigilante, who does the same work as the state, in a bad light? It is precisely because the vigilante\rdoes not have the proper authority to do so.\r\nOne of the main proponents of political legitimacy and political obligation is the social\rcontract theory. If a government has ‚Äòauthority‚Äô, then both and exist: the government has the right to\r\nrule, and the citizens have the obligation to obey. Social contract theory is the oldest and most\rargued theory to prove authority of state over an individual. As all of the variants of social contract\rtheory hold that the government has authority precisely because there is some sort of agreement\r\nbetween citizens and the state.\r\nA valid agreement is an agreement that's morally efficacious ‚Äì that's , it succeeds in\r\nrendering permissible some action to which one consents or in generating an obligation to act during\ra way that one has agreed to act. Conditions for a valid agreement are Valid consent requires a\rreasonable way of opting out, Explicit dissent trumps alleged implicit consent, If A provides B with\rsome scheme or services, that B explicitly refused to pay or recognise the services provided by A. A\rhas no authority over B, even if he uses those services, provided B has no other reasonable\ralternative and Contractual obligation is mutual and conditional.\r\nDoes the social contract adhere to these conditions? Begin with the primary condition on\rvalid agreements: all parties to a contract must have an inexpensive way of opting out. In what ways\rone can one opt out of the social contract? The only option is to leave or immigrate to another\rcountry. Even if this option is not reasonable, there are barriers that prevent that from happening.\r\nBarriers like individual lacks financial resources to do so, one can fail to leave because of the\rattachment he has with his friends, family and neighbours. Finally, he will be subjected to another\rgovernment. The only real option the individual has is given by Michael Huemer,‚Äù they may live in the\rocean, move to Antarctica, or commit suicide‚Äù. \nThe critical issue being discussed here is that there\rare not any reasonable way of opting out of an agreement and that is the price of rejecting social\rcontract is too high. The first condition of valid agreement has not been met by social contract\r\ntheory.\r\nLet us address the second condition: you have not implicitly accepted a contract if you\rexplicitly state that you simply don't accept it. In the case of the agreement, even if minority number\rof individuals have explicitly indicated their disagreement. These are the political anarchists, people\rthat hold that there should be no government. The state continues to impose harsh laws and\rpunishments accompanying it. However vociferously you protest against the agreement, the state\rwon't refund your tax money nor exempt you from the laws. The state here is explicitly neglecting to\rrecognise my explicit dissent and thus it violates the second condition of valid agreement.\r\nThe third criterion is if A provides B with some scheme or services that B explicitly refused to\rpay or recognise the services provided by A. A has no authority over B, even if he uses those services,\r\nprovided B has no other reasonable alternative. For example, government demands that you pay\r\ntaxes because you are using their services. This argument is fallacious, let me give you an equivalent\ranalogy, if you wake up one morning and get ready to go to your office, you find that a woman\rnamed Karen has washed your car even though you had not asked her to do so, are you obligated to pay her or even say thank you for her services? No, you are not. This concludes that Social contract\rtheory violates the third condition for valid agreement.\r\nThe fourth condition states that, contractual obligation is mutual and conditional. This\r\ncondition is obvious and easy to follow, we both must satisfy our end of the agreement otherwise\rthe agreement is void. If a citizen violates a law, the government ensures that the individual must be\rheld responsible and he/she is subjected to the penalties like fines, imprisonment, etc. In return the\r\nstate has the duty to enforce citizen‚Äôs right, protection from criminals, etc. Does the government fail\rin its duties? We are not expecting state to fulfil all of its duties, prevent all of the crime, ensure that\r\nbasic amenities reach all of the individual and efficient use of taxes that is no corruption.\r\nSocial contract theory holds that state must put reasonable effort to fulfil its obligations to its\rcitizens. In India, there are so many cases of government misusing taxes for their own benefits, high\r\nlevel of corruption that put us to shame (Congress, the oldest political party in India, allowed scams\rafter scams during its rule which have resulted in the loss of a staggering amount of Rs\r48,20,69,00,00,000 over the last 70 years) and according to National Crime Records Bureau (2018)\rthe conviction rate for murder, rape, kidnapping and abduction, rioting and hurt(including acid\rattacks) is 41.4%, 27.2%, 29.2%, 18.8% and 32.6%. Can we call this a reasonable effort? There are\rsome cases too where the government refused to hold there end of the bargain. This is an example\rfrom the case Warren v. District of Columbia, where, the Appeals Court cited ‚Äòthe fundamental\r\nprinciple that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such\ras police protection, to any particular individual citizen‚Äô. Here are some other examples of the cases,\r\nwhere the state explicitly refused to hold up their end of the bargain, Hartzler v. City of San Jose, 46\rCal.App. 3d 6 (1975) and DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189\r\n(1989). If the state keeps on refusing its burden of obligation to its citizens, it has self-refuted the\rfourth condition of valid agreement.\r\nGovernment is an institution that is founded upon intentional, harmful coercion. As shown\rabove, the contract or agreement is invalidated and thereby releasing its citizen from their\robligation. I would like to think that I have proved the illegitimacy of state authority. I will conclude\rby quoting HansHermann Hoppe ‚ÄúNo, the state is anything but the result of a contract! No one with\reven just an ounce of common sense would agree to such a contract. I have a lot of contracts in my\rfiles, but nowhere is there one like this. The state is the result of aggressive force and subjugation. It\r\nhas evolved without contractual foundation, just like a gang of protection racketeers. And concerning\rthe struggle of all against all: that is a myth.‚Äù"<br />Author: 'ClickyMe123'  id: 'qzuix7'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qzuix7/by_what_authority_critical_analysis_of_social/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'India adoptee here. Can someone explain Indian family dynamics?'<br />Body: 'I hope it‚Äôs alright to post here. I have recently came into contact with my birth family.

And I‚Äôm not talking about items they themselves would buy; I‚Äôm talking about things that cost $300+. Is that what Indian family members do? Ask other family members to buy expensive items? \n\nSome members talk to me only to later on ask me to ‚Äúdo business‚Äù with them. I never experience that with my American family members. \n\nThey say/ask that younger family members should come live with me. Is that common, to ask family members living abroad to take care of younger family members?

      <li>Title::: "Why MSP can't be made a legal right....here's the economic answer"<br />Body: "A lot of ordinary people and those supporting the demands of the farmers don't understand what that means. First of all MRP and MSP aren't the same. MRP is maximum price not minimum. A lot of people keep equating the two. There's a reason no country in the world has made MSP a legal right. Indian MSP is higher than international prices. WTO rules forbid exporting at a price lower than domestic mandated price. Currently traders sell outside the country at a lower price and try to get export subsidies to make up for the difference. Sugar subsidy alone is worth more than Rs 6,000 crore. All of it will become illegal because of anti-dumping rules of WTO. So the entire export market of India will collapse. Who's gonna eat the excess quantity of Paddy and Sugar that India procures so much? Demand for most farm products is inelastic. There's only so much consumers in India can eat and spend. People really underestimate how much grain India produces. Entire Punjab can stop farming and there will still be paddy left (total rice consumption in India was 102 MT while total production was 121 MT in 2019-20). In fact the total production might reach 150 MT this year mostly because of record production in Telangana. One farm leader was even asked about it in some news debate ,his answer was to leave neo liberal WTO and India should show the way to the world. I don't know what to say. Rent seeking policies like this will only end up destroying the Indian economy. Punjabi farm leaders seem to be betting on this because government already procures most of their rice and there's hardly any industry in Punjab anyway, so they have nothing to lose since they don't export much anyway."<br />Author: 'anny007'  id: 'qzgao9'<br />Score:151<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qzgao9/why_msp_cant_be_made_a_legal_rightheres_the/</li>

The highest award was also given to him and he was granted honorary citizenship by the Soviet Union. \n\nWhen the Kavalis attacked Kashmir, it was Biju Patnaik who made several trips a day from Delhi to Srinagar on 27th Oct 1947 by flying a plane and transporting the soldiers to Srinagar.\n\nIndonesia was once a colony of Dutch ie Holland and the Dutch occupied a large area of Indonesia. Dutch soldiers kept the whole sea around Indonesia under their control and they did not let any Indonesian citizen out. \n\nIndonesia was liberated from Dutch in 1945. In July 1947 Indonesian PM Sutan Sjahrir was house arrested by the Dutch. They sought India's help. Nehru asked Biju Patnaik to rescue the then Indonesian PM Sjahrir to India. \n\nOn 22nd July 1947, Biju Patnaik and  his wife took a Dakota plane &amp; flew out. While flying over the control area of the Dutch, they landed on their soil &amp; showing great bravery brought the Indonesian PM to India safely via Singapore. The incident developed a tremendous energy in them,they attacked the Dutch soldiers&amp; Indonesia attained independence.\n\nLater, when the daughter of Indonesian President Sukarno was born, he called Biju Patnaik &amp; his wife to name the infant. Biju Patnaik &amp; his wife named the President‚Äôs daughter as **Meghawati**. Indonesia had granted honorary citizenship award 'Bhumi Putra' to Biju Patnaik &amp; his wife in 1950.\n\nAfter the death of Biju Patnaik, seven days of state mourning was observed in Indonesia and one day state mourning was observed in Russia and all flags were lowered.\n\n**Source:** [Suman Sharma on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/sharrmasumann/status/1462278980829007878)"<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'qyzwdg'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qyzwdg/biju_bijayananda_patnaik_1916_1997_is_the_only/</li>

      <li>Title::: '1990s changed the way we watched movies | Varun Grover'<br />Body: '***Check out this excellent article filled with nostalgia on the 90s by Varun Grover***\n\nNostalgia is like cinnamon powder of the emotional realm. It‚Äôs present in everything sweet and saleable today - from resto-bar decors to photo filters to memes (‚ÄúAao kabhi haveli pe‚Äù is the latest in the same series in which Alok Nath‚Äôs Sanskaari Babuji was once a rage) to every second Hindi film remixing yet another song from the 1990s. In all this sepia-tinted violence of marketing buzzwords, is there any space or need even to talk about that seemingly unremarkable chunk of time in the history of our cinema and television?\n\nStill - this is a question I am tired of asking myself - what is it about the 1990s that refuses to leave us, the children of that era? (By children of that era, I broadly mean those born post-Emergency but pre-liberalization; boys and girls who gained the visceral sense of body, mind, and the world in the 1990s.) Of course, it was the time of coloured TV, DD Metro, cable channels, a new sensibility in cinema, and it was the time when Baba Sehgal entered our lives. But is that enough? And isn‚Äôt that what every generation believes - that they have lived through the most turbulent or sexy or peaceful or meaningful childhoods? So why do I still dream of Alisha Chinai, Anaida, Jackie Shroff (he was singing a qawwali in a dream I had last month, something he has not done in a Hindi film yet, I think), Varsha Usgaonkar (Toh Saathi Koi Bhoola Yaad Aaya fame), and Kya Banoge Munna (serious DD fans will remember this morning-show gem)? It‚Äôs a probe, this piece, which may take me into places bittersweet.\n\nI was a TV addict right from the day the first set came into our home in 1987. Beltek black and white, with a fan-regulator-like channel changer. There were 12 channels on the regulator but only one in our TV sets and hearts. The Doordarshan telecast was limited to a few hours daily and I would happily watch Krishi Darshan (at 7.30pm) -the studio chat show on farming life and techniques - just because it sometimes showed stock footage of farms. ‚ÄúOutdoor‚Äù footage was a visual candy in those times of claustrophobia-inducing floral-print indoors and cardboard backdrops. Though we were making lots of films for theatrical release, the TV telecast was rationed as if in wartime, as if we would run out of films soon. The doctors running the government hospital of TV had prescribed us only one Hindi film a week (with a single commercial break to remind us of national integration via Mile Sur Mera Tumhara) in addition to a weekly programme of film songs - Chitrahaar. By 1991, owing to our good behaviour, the quota was increased to two films and two Chitrahaars a week. When the news of this doubling of our feed first came, it was so unbelievable that almost everybody rejected it as a rumour. Somebody even claimed that it was to distract us from the Mandal and Mandir protests happening all over.\n\nSo imagine when, in 1994, there was a thick black cable coming straight into our homes from the sci-fi-style dish antenna of the shady but enterprising office of the local ‚Äúcable operator‚Äù (a term uttered with much reverence in those early days) - bringing in the latest films and songs and trendy game shows and much credible BBC and much sexy Santa Barbara - how might a normal Indian kid otherwise addicted to sarkaari deprivation have reacted?\n\nThe fact that this uncensored, unlimited, and hitherto unimaginable technological wonder coincided with my entry into puberty made it all the more life-changing.\n\nI think the first gem we discovered on cable TV was Andaz Apna Apna (1994), a film that didn‚Äôt create much of a buzz when it released in theatres. I immediately put it on top in the ‚Äúfilm suggestion card‚Äù given by the operator that we were supposed to submit at the end of every month. As it turned out, a majority of the subscribers asked for the same film and it played daily in the afternoon for a month. Other notable films that we made the cable guy put on repeat were happy-weepy Hum Aapke Hain Koun‚Ä¶! (1994), Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (1993), Naam (1986), and for some strange reason (possibly action) the Sanjay Dutt-starrer Kroadh (1990). Though after every action film, especially those with a couple of ‚Äúadult scenes‚Äù in them, the cable guy would purify the network by screening a mythological TV serial (rerun of Mahabharat, 1988, or Jai Santoshi Maa, 1975). I didn‚Äôt mind the serials - as long as they showed outdoorsy stuff. Gulshan Kumar made hay as his mythological shows on VHS tapes unspooled on our afternoons.\n\nIt was also the time that I started going to the cinema with friends, unaccompanied by parents. Though males in India don‚Äôt have to struggle much for this, it was still liberating to buy our own tickets and watch a film without the fog of discomfort that surrounded us when an intimate scene played on screen. When Titanic (1997) came in theatres, riding on the buzz about Kate Winslet‚Äôs nude scene, my parents went to watch it first like a bespoke two-member Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) committee and deemed it fit to be watched by us - me and my younger brother (17 and 15, respectively). The nude scene was still there, possibly shortened for the India cut, and that fog of discomfort still gripped many in the hall - one family even walked out at interval, missing the real morbid fun of the sinking. I watched the film again, missing the first day of my Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) coaching, with a friend who hadn‚Äôt seen it yet. I cried at the ending both times.\n\nOn another occasion, watching Hero No.1 (1997), two friends and I won a lucky draw announced during the interval. One of our seat numbers (M-9) had won a newly launched T-Series ceiling fan. We requested the cinema hall manager (Pratibha Cinema, Lucknow) to keep the fan and give us some money in return. He gave us Rs300 and with my share of Rs100, I took my younger brother for dinner at a Chinese restaurant - our first-ever Chinese meal in a proper restaurant with dim lights and dark doors. We finished the meal quickly - my brother fearing we would be thrown out for lack of manners and I fearing the theatre manager would magically appear from somewhere and take the money back.\n\nThe film that defined the decade for me, the one that took me by storm was Rangeela (1995). We didn‚Äôt understand the basics of cinematic language then but the primal energy bursting through the screen was enough to elevate it to the status of a contemporary masterpiece. My friends and I saw it in a theatre and later on many reruns on cable. It was probably the first time I looked at a film not just as entertainment or a sensorial catalyst but also as a thing of beauty, as art.\n\nI read somewhere that most of our life-long active memories are derived from experiences we have had between the ages of 12 and 18. Our teenage years, good or bad, remain a part of our subconscious lives forever. At least anecdotally I can confirm it to be true. The Lucknow house we lived in and moved out of in 2001, still makes regular appearances in my dreams.\n\nI recently went back to the city after a long gap and dropped by at the Gomti Nagar house of my subconscious. It had changed completely - the outer wall, the open terrace, the front yard - all had mutated into another teenager‚Äôs youth. I still rang the bell and explained my situation. The current residents let me in - to allow me to find some speck of resemblance and peace with the time I had spent there. I entered the living room with a TV playing ads, looked at the walls, imagined my mother here, brother there, us playing table tennis on the floor during one happy summer break. I strained to catch a moment from 20 years ago but it was gone. It was time to leave. But just then the ad break on the TV ended, a music channel played Chura Ke Dil Mera Goriya Chali from Main Khiladi Tu Anari (1994), I closed my eyes for a fleeting moment, and I was there. It was that easy.\n\n[Source](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/1OkS0BOI2hs1tIk00K2jFN/1990s-changed-the-way-we-watched-movies.html)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'qytpn3'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qytpn3/1990s_changed_the_way_we_watched_movies_varun/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Failure of the Farm Laws and a greater worrying trend within the current government.'<br />Body: 'I want to give my two cents on why I think the farm laws failed and why it is worrying to say the least.\n\nNow I am not a supporter of the BJP and NaMo, but as a student of economics I considered the laws reformists and much needed, fought with many friends over why they were good so I did feel bad when yesterday Modi announced to repeal these laws. But I wasn\'t surprised, these were practically dead on arrival and once the government suspended them for 1.5 years it was only a matter of time for them to be formally repealed.\n\n\nMY UNDERSTANDING OF WHY MODI FAILED\n\nZero Ground work : No sane person would go about reforming the biggest sector (by workforce) in India with an Ordinance, without any effort whatsoever to try and convince the farmers (who have the most political clout as well). BJP spends so much on advertising bullshit all over India, could\'ve used some of those resources to explain the laws, debate on it and send the message across to farmers. The Green revolution was a success because the politicians spent 5 years doing the ground work for it. Modi took "work from home" quite seriously.\n\nThe Modi-Shah administration has also turned arrogant, the strong numbers that they have in parliament doesn\'t translate into bringing success for their policies. Their previous decisions might explain this disregard for public  discourse. Demonetisation was failure that affected almost every Indian, but the citizens forgave them for this mistake by believing in good intentions. But that is not going to work everytime. Ram Mandir was a success because the public didn\'t need convincing, majority of the country wanted it to happen. I wouldn\'t term Art 370 a success because the situation in Kashmir has deteriorated but they were able to pull it off as Kashmiris don\'t matter a lot in Indian heartland politics.\n\nBut look at the failures, CAA, although passed in the parliament and still a law, nothing has been done. Nobody has spoken about NRC since Modi\'s statement in Ramleela maidan. Nothing achieved for the BJP, but a lot of international shame brought in for the government of India and not to forget lives lost in the Delhi riots. \n\nAlso reformatory bills have been stuck. The reform in Labour codes is stuck. Government reversed it decision on reducing interest rate on small saving accounts in the wake of the Bengal elections and now the farm laws. \n\nEven 300+ seats couldn\'t guarantee good policy and governance as long as morons are in power.\n\n\nHOPE THIS PROVIDES A LESSON TO THESE FUCKERS, BUT IF THE PAST IS TO BE LOOKED AT THEY DON\'T HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THAT.'<br />Author: 'devansh_-_'  id: 'qya7dn'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qya7dn/failure_of_the_farm_laws_and_a_greater_worrying/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Outraging over everything!'<br />Body: 'Dear Friends, I have been observing the outrage posts here with some dismay. Positive stories or analysis does not get the same traction as the latest outrage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of this is just the way that [social media](https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/why-social-media-makes-us-so-angry-and-what-you-can-do-about-it), the internet, and increasingly news operate today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I wish that this sub and all of us can be better than this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne recent example is the rage over an African-American claiming that Yoga is not Indian but African. Yes there are people all over who are ignorant, but using that to post abusive messages against all African-Americans or  Africans will harm India and specifically this group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust for context, while we are outraging about someone thousands of miles away who may have no idea of Indian culture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is someone right next door. Yogi Haider in Pakistan why says" "Born in Pakistani Punjab, Haider is emphatic ‚Äì in contrast to what many Muslims think ‚Äì [that yoga has nothing to do with the Hindu religion and should be accepted by people of all faiths](https://www.desitoday.ca/the-unsung-yogi-of-pakistan)."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I ask you not to outrage about this man, but think strategically. He may be saying that to blunt the arguments of Islamists who want to ban Yoga. Similarly some in the US have tried to distance Yoga from Hinduism to answer the [hate of Fundamentalist Christians who want to ban it](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/alabama-yoga-ban-public-schools-christian-groups).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstead of outraging, we should work to reclaim the narrative about Yoga. When anyone in the world talks about Yoga, there should not be any doubt that it comes from Indian Hindu civilization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen thousands practice this in Pakistan, or around the world, *they are natural allies* and cursing or abusing them, instead of reaching out breaks that link. Even those who may not link it to India, by their very practice are closer to Hinduism than those who do not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe should always keep in mind that when we speak publicly on the internet or interact with non-Indians we are all ambassadors for our country, culture and faith.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will end with a few lines from [another article](https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/yoga-indian-soft-power):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What should India do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Indian government recently announced the creation of a separate Ministry for Yoga, which is a welcome decision. The proposed ministry ought to collaborate with the Ministry of Human Resources and Development to promote institutional collaborations at the international level to further encourage the study and practice of yoga in foreign universities. The practice of yoga should be encouraged in Indian schools to ensure the physical and mental well being of young Indians, which will let Indians lead by example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The Indian government can open studios abroad to train interested people in yoga, yogic therapies and Ayurveda (an ancient Indian medicinal tradition based natural and comprehensive system of health care) to ensure that yogic practices are practiced as described in the Vedas. Collaboration with the Indian diaspora should be encouraged to disseminate yoga training abroad, in regions where it is not yet popular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yoga could be a big attraction for tourists coming to India. The ‚Äòtourist circuits‚Äô of India should add a ‚Äòyoga/spiritual circuit‚Äô to their list. This would further enhance India‚Äôs image as a peace-loving country, apart from generating revenue, increasing foreign exchange, and providing employment to local people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Indian public diplomacy has already been making efforts to showcase yoga.

While we outrage about Modiji kneeling the sanctity of Parliament &amp; Executive in front of a religion-motivated violent goons against desperately needed laws, let\'s have a look at the pillars of democracy which employed their entire machinery to enable the goons. \n\n1. Foreign funding- Protests arent cheap, ask how much money is required to ply alcohol, food, AC, gym, upkeep for hundreds for sustaining the protests for a year.\n\nNot just Soros, foreign based Khalistanis spent massively to ensure booze,food &amp; amentities kept flowing at protest sites.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/li8ndq/you_might_be_sick_hearing_of_sorosfrankly_so_am/\n\n2.Of course, foreign funding for protests doesnt really make sense for maintaining the sovereignty of a nation. So why didnt the govt ban that you, ask?\n\nWell, it did ban and the ban was repealed instantly by our good old judiciary within a month.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2020/03/supreme-court-ngo-foreign-funds-agitations-protests-public-cause-politics/amp/\n\nCurrently Supreme Court is working to dilute the laws even further. Over 20,000 cr INR ie close to 10% of central budget is funnelled by foreign govts particularly US &amp; EU each year for activism &amp; conversions. Govt had made the law such that a foreign funded NGO can transfer money to any NGO as long as it is registered under FCRA, to keep a track of its activities so that foreign funding isnt used for illegal purposes. Supreme Court is claiming that asking those recipient NGOs to get registered with FCRA like the donor NGO is problematic. Really?\n\nhttps://livelaw.in/top-stories/fcra-amendments-2020-supreme-court-ngos-foreign-powers-centre-diversion-of-funds-184100\n\nhttps://livelaw.in/top-stories/fcra-amendments-supreme-court-foreign-contributions-ngo-supreme-court-184731\n\nLet\'s look at other regulations of courts wrt these protests. \n\nGranting bail to a literal ganster in case of armed who had led armed mobsters in attack on Red Fort on Republic Day to hoist Sikh flag at the Fort. His bail plea literally reads "gangster-turned-actviist"\n\nhttps://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/r-day-violence-delhi-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-gangster-activist-lakha-sidhana-734618\n\nIn January, when GOI pled courts not to allow these anarchic elements into the capital, the courts replied "we dont want blood". At least 7 pleas were filed in Supreme Court to protect the civilians from foreign funded anarchists &amp; clear up the roads since January itself. For all the activism our judges do, they still didnt have the time to decide that curbing the freedom of movement of other civilians by a vested minority is illegal. \n\nContrast this to the UK courts which promptly empowered the govt to imprison those who block roads in name of "protests".\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-court-sends-road-blocking-climate-protesters-prison-81229482\n\n*When the courts - half of the "law &amp; order" promote anarchy, what are you to do?*\n\nMultiple rapes were committed at protest sites, a brahmin burnt alive in middle of brahmin hatred promoted at the protest sites, and a sikh dalit brutally murdered for "blasphemy". Regular stories of harassment of girls from families living around the protest sites. Courts which take suomoto of every tree cut on borders, didnt get the time for suomoto on these. Anyone claiming this was not intentional ignorance of the crimes at protest sites?\n\n**When the courts - half of the "law &amp; order" promote anarchy, what are you to do?**\n\n3.

And the elected representatives lost this battle.\n\nThe same battle between elected vs unelected/foreign funded agents is/was fought in every aspect of national consequence: From building border roads (stayed by courts &amp; opposed by media), to a simple case of giving citizenship to persecuted Hindus of Pakistan/Bangladesh, to issue of making websites accountable for news they print (stayed by courts &amp; opposed by media),creating a self governing body to regulate content of streaming channels (stayed by courts &amp; opposed by media) to issue of censorship by social media sites. \n\nIn each of these cases, media acted as a propaganda tool- like they did in case of farm laws- mum on why these laws are needed- mum on why the demand of protesters is one-way road to economic doom of inflation &amp; water scarcity- downplaying all acts of violence- from murders to rapes to assaults\n\n Our democracy was subverted by unelected foreign funded elements.

Now, one other reason could be simply that the Farmers at the border were putting too much pressure and the Govt. had no choice.

Khalistani/Pak backed forces have been legitimately gaining ground at incredible speeds and reports even claim that a pre-1984 situation has been brewing. There‚Äôs no doubt that the laws aren‚Äôt worth it if it alienates a state vital to national security, to this extent.\n\nOnce Capt.

During these uncertain times, there‚Äôs just no way the Indian state can risk a 1984-esque Sikh alienation. Just look at our army, a disproportionate % are Sikh/Punjabi.

There is no future for this god forsaken country. There's no explaining to do to them. Violence should be met with violence, states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bengal should be made to suffer by blocking roads or atleast glueing nails to the road to protest rapes, corruption, extortion, exodus. media should be filled with protests all day every day burn cars run tractors over, block busy streets. Won't pay any income taxes. mass protests to remove all kind of taxes on income should be there why should the burden fall on the hardworking 3-4% of the country. Why should we give money to these politicians who think they can spend it however they want. Taxpayers are not getting any extra facilities in this country infact they are the most overlooked.

      <li>Title::: 'Why Blame Modi'<br />Body: "Why to blame him, he's old probably fighting his last Elections. He achieved what he lived for, the two main movements of his life - Ram Mandir and A.370. He successfully achieved those. The real culprits in my opinion are the BJP leaders on ground level who failed to leave any significant impact and gain votes in the name of Modi. The real culprits are the next generation woke leaders of BJP. \n\nI don't know what's next for Modi but this move is clearly a suicide move in Politics considering how he's perceived as a strong leader. There's a running gag about how Modi is aiming for Nobel, which I don't think so is happening because of the amount of hate he's generated against him for such a long time. \n\nBut all of this still not makes up for why he should be blamed. Today's address sounded weak, and it seemed like he did not get the support he expected by his own party members in convincing people. The PR of MPs and MLAs for BJP has been bad. Only reason why people vote them is because of Modi and I see that reason being gone by 2024.\n\nAlso, this leads us to a very interesting question, What's next for BJP aka What's next for India?"<br />Author: 'ankesh162'  id: 'qxfttd'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qxfttd/why_blame_modi/</li>

Also, she‚Äôs getting paid quite well (20,000 per month). She has been sincere with her work and while is isn‚Äôt educated, she is definitely quite sharp minded. So if she‚Äôs leaving for just two days to be with her husband, son and daughter in law, why would she get emotional? It would have made some sense if she was leaving for good.\n\nIs she feeling guilty of something she might have done or might be planning?\n\nShe did cook today‚Äôs dinner before leaving..and now we are not sure whether we should have that dinner.\n\nI do live in a very secure apartment with 5 layers of security and cctv camera everywhere, so it‚Äôll be hard for her to plan and then execute some crime in collaboration with anyone.
