      <li>Title::: 'This sub fights a daily, exhausting war to reveal the truth and keep the narrative on our side. But I feel all our members must also take this fight to Twitter.'<br />Body: 'I created a twitter account last week. Within 7 days, I realized how utterly misinformed foreigners are about India, Hindus and our major news incidents. Most of them have never even talked to a resident Indian before. No wonder they are so easily duped by propaganda created and spread by the leftist-Islamist alliance. And the sad thing is, they truly want to learn the truth, but there are hardly any mainstream sources available for them most of the time. Even Wikipedia is gone now.\n\nNow, I know, there are several members who believe we shouldn\'t waste time in countering propaganda on foreign soil. Who cares what outsiders think of us, they say. But, left unchecked, they could seriously turn the world against us and lead to an active attempt at outside interference in our domestic policies. Recently, there was quite a big campaign called Hindus against Holi or something like that among Indian-American students at the major US universities. These kids will be brainwashed, then they\'ll join the US govt. and then lead Americans and the world to spew vitriol against us. \n\nAt the end of the day, we aren\'t really interacting with people outside our echo chamber thanks to the wonderful "democratic" and "free speech" ideals of some of the communities on Reddit. And the sheer anonymity means we can\'t really trust anyone. Twitter helps counter both these problems to some extent.'<br />Author: 'BarneySpeaksBlarney'  id: 'fe1rsp'<br />Score:83<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fe1rsp/this_sub_fights_a_daily_exhausting_war_to_reveal/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Here's why Hindus were given the disputed site at Aayodhya.(Facts)"<br />Body: "1. Faiths of many Hindus that Ram was born there and Right to worship was guaranteed by the constitution in the preamble as well as article 24(Right to Freedom of Religion) which is a fundamental right. The other petitioners in the case were fighting over the land which is a property issue &amp; it's protection was under article 300A(Right to property) which is an ordinary right. \n\nThis is important as there is this principle in law where a fundamental right &gt; ordinary right.\n\nConclusion: Mecca to Muslims is same as Aayodhya to Hindus. Also faith and worship is more important than property.\n\n\n\n2. ASI's evidences from excavations\n- Idols and artifacts found which proved that there was a structure upon which the Mosque was built.\n\n- A slab with inscriptions was found and preserved  that in a nutshell talks about Lord Vishnu and someone killing a ten headed demon.\n\n- A floral like object was excavated that is a symbol of Hindu temples.\n\n- Many pillars and underground walls were found that laid a foundation for the Mosque.\n\nConclusion: The structure under the Mosque was not Islamic as Idol worship is forbidden in Islam.\n\n\n\n3. Ancient Scriptures\n-Many ancient foreign travellers including some Mughals had written in their scriptures about Aayodhya, the temple and people praying there.\n\n-Tulsidas who wrote Ramayana also mentioned in his  dohas about Aayodhya where he clearly mentions that there was a temple that was demolished by an invader where Hindus were also killed.\n\nConclusion: The structure under the Mosque was a Temple and had ties to Lord Ram, the 7th avatar of Lord Vishnu and killer of Ravana the ten headed demon.\n\n\n\n4. The Mosque built by Babur by his commander Mir Baqi was not recognised as a Monument of national interest as well as was not in any way an important Masjid to Muslims like the ones in Mecca and Madina. And the fact is many mosques are demolished and shifted for economic and domestic reasons in Islamic countries.\n\nMy final take:\nDemolition of the Mosque and other illegal activities done was not right and a criminal offence.\n\nBut the Mosque would either way be demolished if  an order by the SC would've been given for excavation purposes.\n\nHindus of 16th century were mostly killed, forcibly converted and their temples being destroyed.\n Hence  the AIMPLB and Sunni Waqf board who represent the muslim side should've given the land based on these facts to improve the communal harmony. \n\nIt is therefore this historic judgement which will serve as a basis for others judgments that will further give them a tough fight when Kashi and Mathura are brought in the picture."<br />Author: 'bennychetan98'  id: 'fe02a5'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fe02a5/heres_why_hindus_were_given_the_disputed_site_at/</li>

This was the one single factor that influenced their withdrawal from India,” says retired major-general G.D. Bakshi in a recent book on the last years of British India. “ Bose lost the battle on the India-Myanmar frontier but won the war for India’s freedom.” In these conversations, the then British Prime Minister apparently said that the role played by Netaji's army was paramount in India being granted independence, while the role played by the non-violent movement was dismissed as minimal. In 1956, Clement Attlee had come to India and stayed in Kolkata as a guest of the then governor. Remember, Clement Richard Attlee was the man, who as leader of the Labour Party and British Prime Minister between 1945 and 1951, signed off on the decision to grant Independence to India. Until 1977, the Congress government did not even put up a portrait of Subhas Bose in the Indian parliament. They clearly stonewalled inquiries into Bose’s mysterious disappearance. Bose never got due recognition for all his supreme sacrifice for his country’s freedom.

Why a non-devotee\'s material qualification are said to be of little value ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities."\'Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\'s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\n\nyasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanāsarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥharāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāmano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ\n\n"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods.

      <li>Title::: 'A well written note on IIT coaching institutes and pressure on students'<br />Body: 'Parents get fooled with the "topper photos" ads published by coaching institutes. Seeing the ad they wrongly assume that their son or daughter will also top the exam by joining the institute. \n\nOften the opposite is true.  Students who top would have topped from anywhere!  And most students in these institutes failed to clear these exams. These institutes will never tell you the percentage of students who cleared and who failed. \n\nMore importantly, all students in such places go through a terrible time, feel depressed, lose confidence and never get to feel the joy of learning.  \n\nWhat to look at before joining a coaching class:\n\n1. Before enrolling your child, see who the teachers are and whether they focus on building a child\'s confidence or on breaking it.   Are teachers experienced, secure and confident themselves?  Or are they always trying to prove how smart they are?  \n\n2.  Is the institute only focusing on top students or on all students?  Don\'t look at the top rankers.  Look at the percentage of their students who clear.  While everyone wants their child to be a topper, that\'s not going to happen.  But every child can improve and reach their maximum potential. \n\n3. Does the institute shame or punish students who do badly and make them feel incompetent?\n\n4. Is the learning process fun and enjoyable?  Or do the teachers only focus on competition and tests?  When students ask doubts, does the teacher take it seriously and explain or does he/she blame the student for "not understanding and being stupid"?\n\n5. All institutes are commercial businesses who want to make profits.  If they give scholarship to students who can\'t afford, that\'s good.  But if they give scholarship to all toppers, then how will they make money?  Everyone who is successful pays them nothing.  They make money only by fooling a large number of students who will not succeed.  Such an institute enrolls everyone, but focuses only on the toppers. They make the rest lose confidence and underperform. \n\n6. Sadly, parents who made a mistake and enrolled their kids in such places, are afraid to talk about it outside.  And sometimes they feel bad about sharing it.  So the next set of parents get fooled.  Coaching institutes put a lot of effort to fool parents.  Unless parents get smarter and share more amongst themselves, things won\'t change.  Sadly till then it is the children who will suffer. \n\n7. Last but most important point is do you even need to join coaching ?   Listen to your children. If they say they don\'t want to prepare for JEE or NEET don\'t force them.  Let them do what they want.  And even if they initially said they want to and you enrolled them in a coaching program, continue listening to them.  They may change their mind midway. \n\nCredit: Balaji Sampath'<br />Author: 'apadipodu'  id: 'fdrb42'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fdrb42/a_well_written_note_on_iit_coaching_institutes/</li>

As an Indian-American (dad is from India, mom is Kenyan Indian, but I was born and raised in US), I\'ve been following the CAA controversy closely but of course I don\'t have the on-the-ground perspective so I was hoping to get that here.\n\nAs far as I understand, the CAA only affects refugees, yet I keep seeing it repeated on Western media that Muslims are "scared" that they\'ll get their citizenship taken away (or at least that something bad will happen to them) or that liberals are scared India\'s secular fabric is being taken away even though CAA is specifically supposed to apply to religious minorities in Muslim-majority countries, if I am correct. Am I missing something here about the CAA? Is it just misinformation or something else? I just don\'t understand why Muslims and others are protesting so hard against this law when it seems quite banal, unless it\'s about something bigger like Modi\'s general policies.

      <li>Title::: 'Why and How Love Jihad happens'<br />Body: 'Quran teaches both good and bad things and hence Muslim Clerics teach both good things and bad things to Muslims inside Islamic Schools called Madarsas.. So, all Muslims have both good and bad qualities. 95% Muslims are polite, devout, charismatic and charming and simultaneously believe that only one God should be allowed to exist and that other gods should not exist. A lot of Hindu women are easily falling for Love Jihad because they have pre conceived negative notion about Muslims and when they meet Muslims, they surprised to know that Muslims are polite, devout, charismatic and charming and start thinking "He is not like other Muslim extremists" . And then the same Hindu women who used to think negative about Muslim men fall for the guy.\n\nWe need to teach this to Hindu women that Muslims have both good and bad qualities so that they don\'t get to this conclusion of "He is not like other Muslim extremists". The only conclusion that they should have is "This Muslim is polite,devout, charismatic and charming and at the same extreme with respect to his God beliefs "\n\nAnd on top of this, while Hindu women have freedom to mingle with Muslim men, Muslim women don\'t have the freedom to mingle with Hindu men.That is why mostly inter-faith marriages are between Muslim men and Hindu women (And also because intersectional feminist pages have been infiltrated by Islamists and they post  pro Muslim content and post about how "Hindu men are trying to control Hindu women" and this creates an urge in Hindu woman to fight against oppression by deliberately getting a Muslim boyfriend.

Ali, the fourth one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and Hz. Muawiyah, the governor of Damascus, who did not accept his caliphate. The battle took place in 657 in Siffin, which is in the east of Raqqa; many Muslims were martyred in this battle. \xa0\n\n\xa0It is narrated in history books that the army of Hz. Muawiya resorted to a trick (?) by placing pages of the Quran on the tip of their spears. He was thus able to defeat Hz Ali. \n\nNow let's talk about delhi riots in perspective of this above story. We need to counter a battle of idealogies by using their own means. Ofcourse with lesser blood shed. \n\nHere is how the things can be done. Bring 50-60 people in full islamic attire protected by metal plates and kevlar inside the clothes. Give them hand Mike and let them March with quran in hand quoting the peaceful verses of Quran . The same thought which has led to picking up stones will be used to put people in dilemma. There are very few who are actually angry over hindus majority of them are just made to think or better say brainwashed in a particular manner to be violent. Yes, seeing the Qur'an which cannot be burnt by Muslim community nor stones can be thrown at them. You will have the conundrum which can be used to immobilize the supporters.  If they still attack we can shame them for their misdeeds. Either way it's a big aversion tactic. \n\nVoilence will beget violence , but if you defeat the ideology then you are in the game.

As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\'s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\n\nyasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanāsarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥharāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāmano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ\n\n"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy."

I'd really appreciate it if you guys could help me navigate through the turbid moral waters here. \nOne of the main argument from the anti-caa side is that our country was never meant to be based on religion and that we were always supposed to be secular. Liberty, equality, etc. And based on those principles, religiously selective benefits are unconstitutional. I totally agree with the argument up to this point. However, is a responsibility to maintain a secular atmosphere implied, included, or required in the premise? Why or why not? And if it is indeed implied, what's the breaking point according to the Constitution, at which national interest becomes a higher priority to the government than maintaining secularism. Everybody is talking about rights, but nobody about responsibility. And personally, I don't like extrapolation as an argument to prove a point, on either side of the spectrum. Consistency matters, of both good and bad behavior. All the arguments about the outliers on either extremes are equally stupid. What matters is the location of the average and how close to the average the majority is grouped. And what happens if the average for any individual group moves too far away from the expected national average, of secularism or nationalism?"<br />Author: 'i__need__answers'  id: 'fd4ccd'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fd4ccd/a_breach_of_contract/</li>

My requirements were a powerful (cpu) laptop with metal body and 3 years extended warranty. I did not want a GPU. Here are the cons of each laptop that I found. I finally ended up purchasing a Lenovo Ideapad S540 offline.\n\n1. Many laptops below 60k have surprisingly bad displays. The thing about many laptops is that you cannot see the display IRL before ordering it and if you receive a bad display you are kind of stuck with it. The Asus Vivobook series is famous for this. I was considering the Asus X403FA. It is a near-perfect laptop with a metal body, but I went through a lot of shops before seeing one in person and the display was very, very dull(none of the youtube reviews mention this). Many of the Dell Inspiron 3000/5000 series, Lenovo laptops(S145) and Vivobooks have poor quality displays. I don't know if manufacturers are using this as a cost-cutting feature. Do get a good look at the laptop display IRL before purchasing it. \n2. Pulse width modulation - Many laptops use low PWM which causes a lot of strain on eyes. Put your phone camera in slow-motion mode and look at the laptop display at less than zero brightness. If it is flickering, then it might be having low PWM and can cause eye strain. The very popular ACER swift-3 seems to have this issue, so does my IdeaPad s540. It is very difficult to fix this using software. If someone knows more about PWM comment below\n3. Many laptop companies do not give extended warranty for online purchase often making it cheaper to purchase the laptop offline(laptop + extended warranty might be cheaper offline). IMHO is extremely important if you are spending 60k on a laptop. I got Lenovo's 3year warranty + 3 year ADP for Rs 2299. The same thing online will cost around 8-10k (Hp has the same thing). I don't know about Asus and Acer.\n4. There are many small things that you might miss if you are purchasing a laptop without having a look at it. The IdeaPad S540 I purchased does not have a good keyboard(its travel distance is very small). Also, a few of the Ideapad series 8th gen models I saw have a small touchpad lag that makes it incredibly annoying to use. An online purchase means that you might not be able to return it if they don't acknowledge this as a flaw.  Some Asus zenbooks have bad touchpad which lags for a second every minute or so.\n5. The build quality is difficult to judge online. If possible, get a metal body laptop. Metal body and metal finish are two different things. \n\nI was considering between Asus vivobook x403FA / Hp 14 ce 3006 tu / Lenovo ideapad S540 / Asus zenbook  UX331FAL-EG003T / Dell Inspiron 5490.\n\nAsus vivobook x403FA - Poor display. Everything else is perfect about this laptop. I am not sure how   \ngood Acer's warranty is.\n\nHp 14 CE 3006 TU          - It is not a full metal build and battery backup is low(only 42wh)\n\n Lenovo IdeaPad S540 - Bad keyboard. Plus the display seems to have low Pulse-width modulation. Some models seem to have touchpad lag so never order this online\n\nAsus zenbook UX331FAL-EG003T - Touchpad seems to have some sudden stop issues. Reviews also   \nseem to mention this \n\nDell Inspiron 5490.                        - You cant see this laptop IRL before purchasing, its online only. One dell support person I called could not even confirm that this laptop has IPS display. It also seems that exchanging your old laptop is difficult with this dell online-only model.\n\nLet me know what you think. Is there any other model I should have considered? What is your experience buying laptop online?"<br />Author: 'throaway201122'  id: 'fcy78x'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fcy78x/things_to_know_about_ordering_laptop_online/</li>

Turkey is using 1 million + refugee it has to bargain the EU/NATO support for its campaign in Syria. However, this move of Turkey has further isolated it as Greece activated EU mechanism to get its border secured.Frontex, the EU border patrol is now reaching Greece to help Greek authorities in its gigantic task to handle the influx.\n\nIn other words, in its bargain to gain support from EU, Turkey has further isolated itself by threatening Greece with stream of refugees. Greece used to be a pariah member in the EU, given its financial irregularities. But over the last few years Greece has really worked in making its financial institutions more transparent and efficient, thereby gaining more respect from the stronger members of EU.\n\nHowever, Greece and Turkey conflict go far back in the history, when the Turks used to rule over a part of Greece and commit unmentionable atrocities against the Greeks. And Turkey, as we know has also been a lot more vocal against India lately, and this is our turn to start being vocal against Turkey, and its threats to Greece. Enemy of your enemy is your friend. If we all started tweeting in favor of Greeks, during this difficult time in their country, we might end up having one more ally in the international arena. The tweets from Indians will bring Greece closer to India, and when India might need more international support in it's digital campaign, the Greeks could come handy.\n\nSo I invite all my Bhratas on twitter, and start tweeting in favor of Greece and against Turkey, with the current hastags that are famous such as : #Isupportgreece, #Istandwithgreece, #Greece and so on."<br />Author: 'desi_swagger'  id: 'fcvvqx'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fcvvqx/greek_turkey_border_conflict/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Akbar, his experiments with religion and his religious policies'<br />Body: "Contemporary records say that Birbal often spoke ill about the faith and he was one of the closest associates of Akbar. Birbal also apparently constantly pushed him on Surya worship and Akbar did definitely incorporate a lot of these what you would call decidedly Dharmic habits in his faith including sun worship. Iirc his Hindu courtiers even  pushed their luck and tried getting him to wear a tilak but Akbar drew the line there and never did go there afaik. He did publicly worship the sun and fire though and had lamps lit (not for vision but the ceremonial lamps) throughout his palace. Raksha bandan was celebrated in court and he himself wore the rakhi. All nobles, including Muslims were to also do this. Shiv Ratri was a night of festivity and he was said to have even partaken bhang and alcohol in the company of sadhus. \n\nThe greatest sign though of his tolerance, secular approach and sheer greatness was a ruling which essentially said that the office of the Emperor was above the office of the Mullah in matters of justice. \n\nWhile Islamic Emperors often did pass judgement, not one till then and afaik after ever ruled themselves above the word of God. In this ruling Akbar said that while the Islamic Sharia judges rulings would be respected, it was his, the emperor which had the final word and that too, this won't be based on any scripture but His Majesty's own understanding of the case (reason over religion). \n\nAll this was not apostasy in his eyes because he had based on his experiments and fact finding come to the conclusion that Islam was established but with a fixed tenure of 1,000 years and the time had passed, ergo he could do as he wished without blaspheming Allah. \n\n\n\n\n\nBadauni iirc directly records that of his close circle, it even included a Yazidi, who apparently blasphemed the prophet day in day out. Any other Muslim would have chopped his head off but like most Dharmic kings, Akbar gave him a patient listening. \n\nBy the mid of his tenure, he was so disaffected by Islam that he denounced fasts and daily prayers itself as irrational. \n\nThis is when the search (both internal within himself and external through his famous baitaks-another thing Dharmic kings used to famously do) for a religion based on reason began. \n\nAkbar if these sources are to be believed, didn't talk much in these forums but absorbed the debates like a sponge, but shaping his entire faith, which at this point was NOTHING like Islam. \n\nI mean the man even set up a fire temple modeled on the Zoarastrians (after an embassy from that religious group)\n\nYes in his early days he was a reasonably devout Muslim but over time he evolved and decided that one faith didn't answer his calling, that all were beset by irrational thinking and thus was born his own unique faith. \n\nIt was not just Hinduism, Christianity and it's own philosophies deeply affect this great soul. He even ordered the princes of the court to learn the basics about all these faiths. \n\nIn summation, he was definitely born a devout Muslim but through his own intellectual prowess he surpassed all faiths, investigated all of them deeply and created his own one (this is covered in history but the details are skipped on)"<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'fctb09'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fctb09/akbar_his_experiments_with_religion_and_his/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A principle-based nation state is better than an identity-based nation state. Change my mind.'<br />Body: 'Most nation states in this world are formed based on the identity of people who live there. For example, Japan is predominantly of one race, language and cultural tradition; On the other end of the spectrum, Iraq has multiple races (Arabs, Kurds), multiple religions &amp; sects (Sunni, Shia, Yazidi) and multiple languages (Arabic, Kurdish), which makes it difficult for Iraq to be a stable nation state. \n\nThen there are newer countries where all these identities don\'t matter, what does is whether or not you believe in some basic principles practiced by almost everyone in the country. When someone migrates to Canada for example, it is expected of them to respect women\'s rights, LGBT rights, right to freedom of speech and expression, etc. **I think that these kinds of principle-based nations are more stable and could survive for the longest time,** because your birth identity doesn\'t matter, it\'s about whether or not you follow certain fixed set of rules. \n\nIndia can become a principle-based nation, because of its heterogeneity, and the principle doesn\'t need to be liberal. For example, there can be a rule like: "If you\'re Indian, then you should be open to all faiths, in line with the pluralistic ancient Hindu tradition".

She declared love and had phone sex by the end of the week. It was sudden for me but I thought maybe she is in infatuation state. After couple of months, family decided it’s time to get engaged. Now she wants to chat 4-6 hours everyday, says let’s create memories. \n\nShe organizes a getaway for a day and we kiss on the roadside. Mind that kissing in public places is an offence in India. This was the first kiss of my life but I was shit scared. Anyway, I still felt this was going too fast. I don’t have previous relationship experience so can’t decide well. Can’t share this with family either. I played along. \n\nWe got engaged. Gifted about 75 gms of gold ornaments and an iPhone to the fiancé. Scheduled to get married in next 3-4 months. Girl is way too much into me or so she shows. Time passes, 1 month left for the wedding. Girl asks me to buy my own car so that we can go on trips after wedding. I was anyway planning to get one, thought this would be a good gift. I buy one. Now just around the wedding day the bride’s family asks me to give them the car and then they will drive it back to my place and declare that they gifted the car to me. I said no right in their face. This could get me in jail under dowry. I can easily prove ownership but India’s dowry rules favour girls. We go behind bars as soon as a complaint is raised. I suspected this is alla ploy. Reading the above events, this maybe apparent but trust me it all happened so swiftly that it didn’t look like a ploy. \n\nAfter I said no for the car, girl’s brothers started misbehaving, used abusing language. I kicked them out of our house. I texted the girl about the situation and she blocked me. I canceled the wedding.\n\nNow I’m really in love and she puts condescending posts on various social media showing hatred and also with her new fiancé. I don’t get it. It hasn’t been 10 days yet. I feel devastated right now. On one hand, I feel I just saved my ass and on other hand I feel I lost the first love. My mind knows she was a gold digger and her family was with her but my heart is still murmuring her sweet msgs before all this happened.\n\nHow do I get over this?'<br />Author: 'coconutIsNotEnough'  id: 'fcnvp2'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fcnvp2/first_time_bad_luck_how_do_i_get_over/</li>

I can’t write who am I because these people are powerfull and they will come after me.\n\nThe Delhi riots were instigated by Muslims and many Hindus have died. They have been wanting to start some sort of killing since December when CAA was passed. We saw Shaheen Bagh and even before that, there were already Muslims doing riots. From Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat, Bengal and everywhere else. Muslims threw stones, petrol bombs and what not. So it is weird that Wikipedia article paints Delhi riots as some program to kill all Muslims by Hindus.\n\nWhile everyone is outraging, I know who exactly is ruining India image in the world. It is one man called Deepesh Raj who calls himself DBigXray.\n\nI know his identity because in Wikipedia, when you see his old edits, you can see that he created page of some weird school is in a small town called Carmel School. When you see the Facebook page of Carmel School, I found Deepesh Raj bragging about putting the school in Wikipedia.\n\n📷\n\nDeepesh Raj is actually an Aam Aadmi Party supporter and is known to very close to Arvind Kejriwal. It is this reason that he is making sure that the truth of Delhi riots is not out.\n\nIn Wikipedia, do you wonder why Tahir Hussain is not even mentioned? It is because Deepesh Raj is probably getting money from Kejriwal to hide these facts.\n\nThink about it. Who does it benefit if Delhi riots paint Hindus badly and Muslims as victims? It is only Kejriwal because his votebank will be happy. Deepesh Raj is just doing work for Kejriwal. I cannot prove that he is taking money, but he is known to have political closeness.\n\nIt is the business of such people to hate Hindus and love Muslims who kill Hindus even when Muslims are burning Delhi.\n\nI request nationalists to spread this maxx so the truth can come out.\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2020/03/delhi-anti-hindu-riots-wikipedia-bias-edits-dbigxray-investigation/'<br />Author: 'POL051292'  id: 'fcgxno'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fcgxno/copy_pasting_a_post_by_an_anonymous_handle_on/</li>

So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Kṛṣṇa. As a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he could not forget Kṛṣṇa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Kṛṣṇa\'s name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Kṛṣṇa can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa constantly.

      <li>Title::: 'A LONG-FORM dialogue on understanding the Left mindset that I think will help those feeling helpless against the demonization of Hindus in the international press and in understanding why the Indian left media acts the way it does.'<br />Body: 'Hello everyone. Over the past few days I as well as others have been thoroughly disturbed by what has been going on. The way the leftist media has been selectively presenting facts, committing errors of omission, often straight out lying to construct their narratives to ruin India\'s image internationally, and to break down the morale of the people who support the constitutional changes taking place in the country currently. Upon seeing these lies peddled by the media, a family member during a call with me, asked indignantly, "Ye log jhoont kyun dikha rahe hain? Inhe pata nahin ki asliyat kya hai, ya jhoont bolte hain? tum bade shahr mein rehte ho, tumhein pata hoga?" \n\nAs a conservative, up until now I\'d been focusing solely studying the philosophy of the right. So basic economics, Thomas Sowell, Karl Popper, Paul Johnson, and other important scholars of the right. Only recently did I out of curiosity started studying a little bit of the left, and I have to say, while their ends might be wrong, the means they\'re employing are quite effective. Admittedly, my knowledge of the left is very basic. But for what it is worth, here it goes. I\'ll put it down in dialogue form. Hope you find it informative. \n\nP.S. - After I started writing, I just kept on, and the post grew to this length. I\'m grateful that this subreddit helped me articulate my views.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why does the left-wing media not see that the riot was both-sided? That both Hindus and Muslims participated in it, and that there was advanced planning on part of the Muslims too? Why is it still trying to portray the Muslims as a victim minority group, when it so obviously a lot better organized and being around 15% of the country, and making up 24% of the world, is a global majority compared to the Hindus?** \n\n Because the left is not interested in the question of who is being unfair to whom. It is not a question of whether Hindus are oppressing the Muslims, or the other way around. These are pretenses to dupe the people into believing that they advocate for "minority rights" and "open borders" out of compassion and humanistic intentions. Their real objective is something else. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is it?**\n\nSome kind of internationalism. An order where the sovereignty of the individual nations is severely compromised and a top-down international government has a say in every little thing national entities do[i](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote1sym). A society where all fault-lines based on religion, ethnicity, etc. disappear and only one division remains: the one based on class and class-consciousness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I\'m somewhat aware of these terms. What you\'re saying sounds like Marxism. But as far as I know, Marxism failed in the Soviet Union catastrophically, so why would they try to do it again in India? And isn\'t this a conspiracy theory?**\n\n It sounds like a conspiracy theory, yes, to people who have not been acquainted with this philosophy. It is not. Look, theories seem probable only in light of other knowledge that a person already has in their mind. Think about the idea of the sun moving around the earth. The idea would sound ridiculous to someone who\'s not familiar with the notion of gravity, and the model of the solar system. If you were to tell a ninth-century Indian about this notion, they\'d probably balk at you and call you crazy. I\'m not saying what I\'m stating is a scientific theory, but this is just to say that certain ideas seem senseless until you get a sense of the background propositions, the knowledge *in the light of which* the idea makes sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Okay, what you\'re saying seems** ***bakwaas*****, but fine, what\'s the "background knowledge"?**  \n\nIt\'ll take a bit of time. You\'ll have to bear with me. And it\'ll seem to have no bearing upon the present situation, till the very end. Are you up for continuing this conversation?   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sure, I have time. Go ahead.** \n\nOkay, so here we go. You\'re aware that soon after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, this guy Karl Marx was born. He was an almost-exact contemporary of Darwin, and from the middle of the 19th century onwards he wrote several tracts on the ideology of communism alongside another guy called Engels. So we have *The Communist Manifesto* and *Das Capital*, and a huge bunch of compiled writings, including essays on India.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes, yes. The idea that the bourgeoisie groups together as a class and controls the means of production, i.e. the big factories, and uses economic coercion and the power of the state to force the proleteriat -- the poor industrial workers -- into toeing their line. I know that this idea created havoc in europe soon after, and reached its apogee with the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, when the Bolsheviks headed by Lenin came to power. It quickly turned into a state of oppression, and under Stalin the state turned became a machinery of terror and the ego-maniac killed hundreds of thousands of the citizens. The state survived for the next forty years or so and finally republic states into fifteen repubic states around 1990. It\'s often joked about since. What\'s the catch?**  \n\nThe catch is that what we know of and what we criticize is merely Soviet Marxism. Soviet Marxism is just one type of Marxism among several others, and often when we criticize the same, we criticize its economic aspects and Marxists laugh at us because that\'s not even the kind of Marxism they\'re aiming for in the present. There are other schools of Marxism flourishing in the democratic world that a lot of us are unaware of. This is specially true for the India, where most of the people as it is are ignorant of political ideologies -- “*Are bhaiya kya hai ye left and right? Ham to insaaniyat dekhte hain ...*” \n\n \n\n**Okay, go ahead. Tell me about those schools.**  \n\nLook, when we criticize Marxism for its faulty economics we criticize classical Marxism, Marxism as it was penned down by the originators Marx and Engels. When we critize Marxism for its turning into a reign of terror, we mostly mean the Stalinist regime and Soviet Russia. What we completely ignore is **Western Marxism**. The Marxism that emerged in the Western European countries as Eastern European countries fell under the Soviet spell in the 1917-1923 revolutions following the October Revolution. Think about the progression of Marxist philosophy like this:  Classical Marxism --&gt; Leninism --&gt; Leninism-Stalinism --&gt; Western Marxism.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\'s Western Marxism? How\'s it different from other forms? And this better have a bearing on India pretty soon.**  \n\nBear with me.  In a very rough way, I can put it this way. In the inter-war period, between 1919 when WWI ends and 1939 when WWII begins, Marxism went a series of crises.   \n\nFirst, the Soviet revolutions took place only in the eastern european countries, the Balkans and the Central Asian countries, etc. In the western european countries, countries like England, France, Germany, Italy, communist revolutions failed and were repressed thoroughly by the state. Why? In Germany and Italy, the ideology of fascism took root. England had a strong democratic  and classical liberal tradition, and France already had ideas of liberty and social democracy engrained into it by the French Revolution. In summary, Marxism failed to take root in the western europe. This was ironic, since these were the countries where the population of the industrial workers was the greatest. The eastern european countries didn\'t have much industry, and so minimal industrial workers which constitute the proleteriat, and revolutions there, contrary to what Marx had anticipated, were won on the basis of the peasants.    \n\nSecondly, after the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin came to power, and immediately turned the state into a dictatorship. Marxist political and economic philosophy, which until then was being constantly added to by a variety of thinkers, was suddenly strangled. People either were members of the official communist party, and strictly and silently observed its diktat, or they were exiled or killed. This brought an end to innovative Marxist philosophy in Eastern Europe.    \n\nAnd so the epicentre of Marxist philosophy shifted to western europe, where it had failed. Communists either were imprisoned, exiled, or concealed their affiliation and worked in secrecy.   \n\n The biggest question before these Marxists: why did we fail in the west? What happened? Why does the working class not organize together and get up in arms against their oppressors and overthrow the state? Why do they still vote and feel proud about their countries? Why do they love a nation that exploits them? Marxist philosophy had asserted so much, and much of what happened was contrary to its expectations. Marxists needed to get back to the drawing board. Analyze what happened. Amend their philosophy to explain their failure.[ii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote2sym)  **Interesting. So how did the Western Marxists alter their philosophy?**\n\n In Italy, Mussolini came to power in the early 1920s, and immediately started using the state appratus against the PCI, the Communist Party of Italy. This party was headed by a guy called **Antonio Gramsci** (1891-1937), a small, physically-weak clever dude who would later change the course of Marxism as it is practiced today. This guy was put behind bars in 1926, where he, like Hitler, Nehru, Savarkar, Mandela, and many other political leaders, had time to meditate on his politics and write about it.    \n\nWestern Marxism in its fundamentals is a progression of what Gramsi\'s thought as it was conceived in the Italian prison.  He challenged certain fundamental propositions regarding the how the state achieves power: most importantly, he challenged the **dominance account of power**: the idea which asserts that the state obtains and maintains power by *force* and *economic coercion,* that is, that the state beats people down or blackmail people economically to hold on to power. This was a commonly-accepted notion amongst Marxists of that era, and one that blew back into their faces, since quite embarassingly, the “working class” liked their state, a lot of them being fiercely nationalistic, and didn\'t pay attention to the communist call for revolution in Western Europe.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**But is it not true? The state does dominate. Look at China, look at Tianeman square, look at the south american countries, how they brutally beat down on protests using state power. How else does the state rule?**   \n\n You must understand the basic problem that Antonio Gramsci is fighting with, which, simply put is: *why are the people in democratic (and fascist) nations not responding to the Marxist call for revolution? Why do they love their countries so much? Why are they patriotic, and enroll in armies and sing national anthems with heartfelt pride for states that – according to the Marxists – are all about exploiting them?*  \n\n  That the state rules by force is true, but according to Gramsci, it is only part of the whole truth. Clearly, the British weren\'t suppressing communist revolts by the dozens using arms. The communist revolts weren\'t happening in the first place because people didn\'t have that much of a problem with the government. They had disagreements, they had grievances, sometimes grave, but they didn\'t despise the government like the Marxists hoped they would. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **I see. So what did Gramsci propose?** \n\nHe divided the factors of state power into two. The state rules by two methods: by maintaining **coercion** and **consent.**    \n\nWhat is coercion? Simply put, coercion is the use of force and economic sanction on part of the government to maintain power. Shutting down farmers\' protest in countryside Maharashtra by a lathi-charge? Coercion. Prosecuting you for seditious content and putting you in prison? Coercion. Firing you from your govt. job if you criticize a policy? Coercion. The state applies coercion by the use of what he termed the **political society**, which is constituted by the armed forces, the police, the judiciary, and so on. This much was known to the Marxists of his day.  \n\nConsent, is an innovative – and very subversive – idea on Gramsci\'s part. It influences all modern thought on Marxism in the democratic countries today. Basically, consent , as conceived by Gramsci is the willingness of the citizens – the working class, mostly, but others as well – to *willingly be party to their exploitation by the state.* People fall in love with the state. They develop feelings of patriotism towards the state. They become loyal, fiercely so. How does the state do this? By something Gramsci called **political hegemony*****.*** Here is political hegemony defined:  \n\n “*the domination of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society so that the ruling-class worldview becomes the accepted cultural norm, the universally valid dominant ideology, which justifies the social, political, and economic status quo as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs that benefit only the ruling class.*”[iii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote3sym) \n\n Basically, a large group of upper-to-middle-class people who subtly control the state come together and propagandize an ideology that justifies the suffering of the working/lower class by using democratic, religious, nationalistic, ethnic, linguistic, or any other means. The oppressed people are deceived into believing it, and don\'t revolt, instead consenting to the alleged oppression.    Consent is generated through what Gramsci called the **civil society,** which are “the cultural institutions and practices that appear to be independent of politics, but in fact are not.*”* So television, religious festivals, the republic day parade, the daily national anthem at school, the Sanskrit language, all of that is propaganda on part of the state to get your consent.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Damn, that\'s ... interesting**.    \n\nSounds strangely convicing, no? It seems to explain so much you see around you.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It kinda does, yeah. So ... if we relate this to India, then ...?** \n\n Yes, so take the Bhagavad Gita. According to the Western Marxists, the philosophy of Bhagavad Gita is simply a bourgeois ideology used by the Brahmins to maintain hegemony, or power, over the other castes.  “Devote yourself entirely to me, and thinking every action of yours a sacrifice, O Arjuna, perform your *dharma.”* An ideologue of Gramsci\'s thought might say that this is just a Brahmin ploy to maintain a social order that favours them. “Do your duty, don\'t concern yourself with questions of right and wrong, don\'t worry about all of those philosophical problems, go and kill your brothers.” And of course, if a Dalit reads the Gita, the message that he is supposed to glean from it is, “Do your duty, even if it is cleaning after other people\'s excreta.”  \n\nNow, of course, such a convenient analysis straw-mans the Gita, and ignores all the sublimity of the scripture. It ignores the fact that this idea of surrendering your will to God is not a hegemonic ploy uniquely attributable to the Hindu scripture, but a constant motif of ancient philosophical thought. Stoicism, for instance, a mostly secular sect of Greece and  hellenestic Rome, suggests surrendering your will to the Gods, and performing what is under your control, and leaving everything else to nature. It\'s a doctrine that, among other things, aims to remove the doubts and fears that curtail our action when we are too attached to victory or loss to really do what needs to be done, to actually try our best to achieve our objective. God, or Gods, can be read here to mean that part of nature that is beyond your control, that even with all our knowledge of science, is still  beyond our grasp. Krishna\'s idea is not to hegemonize Arjuna, but to point out the existential rationalizations Arjuna is engaging in to justify his unwillingness to fight because he\'s too attached to his brothers, even when *they\'re exploting him*.   \n\n But if you will find exploitation in everything if that is only what you look for. This is not to deny that religious authorities have justified exploitation by referring to Gods, but to say that that is not the gist of all *sanskriti*. *Sanskriti* would by its nature – because it is a reflection of the society -- incorporate elements of all aspects of the society, from the depths of depravity to the heights of sublimity, and you will find in it what you look for. The idea is to look at --  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**But you digress. This is not a discussion about the value of tradition. Let\'s perhaps stick to Western Marxism.**  \n\nYes, right. The point is, a Gramscian theorist would see attempt at exploitative propaganda in all forms of culture and political ideology.  The idea of Britain, its literature, its nationalism, its protestant religious identity, its pride, its democratic traditions all the way from Magna Carta to the modern times, is seen as a popular disguise, to feed false satisfaction into the people so that they do not revolt.    \n\nMoreover, identities of nation, religion, language, etc. disable people from marching to the beat of the drum of class-consciousness. If I\'m an industrial worker and you\'re an industrial worker, but I\'m Hindu and you\'re Muslim, or you speak Tamil and I speak Urdu, and we\'re particularly proud of these idenities, we\'re less likely to unite as a class to fight against the “bourgeoisie.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **And so you\'re saying that the idea of India, its ancient civilization, its philosophy, its Hindu cultural identity, is thought by western marxists a kind of propaganda to generate consent to oppress the lower classes by the Brahmins?**\n\n Yes, something like that. That is why they deride everything that remotely relates to the Hindu tradition. The Indians Gods are taboo-ed, caste-strife is exaggerated, the Hindu religious identity is stigmatized. Hell, Kalidasa\'s poetry and drama, which is one of the best works of literature ever produced, is barely mentioned by the intellectuals. We barely are aware of the achievements of our civilization. All this, because they think its a hegemonic ploy by the upper-classes to rule the state. Thus you have NDTV ridiculing the search for the Saraswati river – which is a perfectly genuine historical inquiry – and P.K. ridiculing  Lord Shiva, and a Barkha Dutt and a Rajdeep Sardesai making fun of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for saying something favourable to the idea of India, and other innumerable instances like that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**But why that doesn\'t explain why the left is so lenient towards Islam. After all, if religion is a hegemonic strategy, then Islam ought to be considered one of the most oppressive hegemonic ideologies there are. Why is that not stigmatised?** \n\nSeveral reasons. The most important being this:  \n\nIndia, in the near future at least, is liable to nationalism founded on the Hindu identity. Nationalism, just like religion, is anathema to Marxism, since nationalism is precisely what led to its  failure in western europe. By pointing repeatedly to the historic faults of Hinduism, sometimes real, but mostly imagined, the idea is to break down any possibility of national pride, so that India remains susceptible to increasing Marxist order. Hindu stigma is very important for the left in India, since it is the only thing that stands between them and nationalism. Once the Hindus really come into their own, learning of their past, learning of the crimes that have been committed upon them, the fierce pride and anger will likely obliterate the marxist left-wing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes, but why not criticize Islam equally?**\n\n Because there is no threat of Muslim nationalism in India in the near future. At the most, if the demographic ratio shifts against the Hindus, it will eliminate the possibility of Hindu nationalism within current Indian borders. Since nationalism is based on historical memory[iv](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote4sym), and what is a matter of pride to Muslims is a matter of embarassment to Hindus and vice versa, you can be sure that a skewed demographic ratio will remove the possibility of any nationalism altogether. What, then, will remain? Either a weak state maintaining the present borders, in which case it will increasingly look to an outside, international government to conduct its affairs, or it will disintegrate into a number of non-cooperating states that will individually be too weak for their respective nationalisms to pose any threat to a globalist left-wing order. \n\nThis is also party why a blind eye is turned to the excesses of Islam by the immigrants in the Western countries as well. The greater the proportion of people in your nation-state that don\'t share the common historical memories vital for national pride, the weaker the state becomes, and the more susceptible to global intervention. That is one reason why anti-immigration laws are so vehemently opposed by the left.    \n\nHere is another critical idea by the Gramsci that explains the blindness of the left towards Islam\'s excesses. Gramsci, in proposing a solution to dealing the cultural hegemony of the ruling class, proposed the idea of the **working-class hegemony*****.*** This is a political and cultural alliance led by the marxism intellectuals, of course, and composed of what he termed ***subalterns***, i.e. All those groups that are not part of or loosely part of the dominant hegemony. So, in the Indian context, this would mean trying to recruit first and foremost the Muslims, then – constantly failing to, but still trying – the scheduled castes, the Kashmiris, and so on. This also includes subversive acts such as trying to promote Sikh seperatism, getting it to clash with the state, and then recruiting it into the working-class hegemony.  \n\nWith regards to Islam, the following tenet of Gramsci\'s thought is most pertinent: “to genuinely represent the subalterns the working class hegemony has to take seriously their practices and values, *even if they\'re not progressive”*[*v*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote5sym). This, in the Indian context means that, in order to supress  the **dominant ideology** which is the Hindu tradition, Islam has to be accepted with all its anti-progressive elements: the intolerance, the terrorism, the expansionism, the  archaic codes for women, and so on. This, simply because, in India, Islam is the biggest member of the alliance of the working-class hegemony.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I see. But clearly, Islam is not susceptible to the Marxist ideology. It aims for an order derived from the sharia, not from Marxism. To what extent then is this alliance compatible?**  \n\nIn their ideologies they are anti-thetical. Islam as it currently stands, and as it is likely to stand in the future, will never accept the marxist ideology. Both Islam and modern Marxism are fundamentally non-nationalist, imperialist orders (even though for expedience they subscribe temporarilies to these orders). Marxism strives for an internationalis order based on class-consciousness and rule of the proleteriat, while Islam looks to extend the sphere of influence of the *ummah*, the global muslim community, by whatever pragmatic means possible, even if it is nationalism[vi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote6sym). On the world scale, they\'re competitors rather than allies. But, in terms of the short-term goals they want  to achieve, i.e. the defeat of nationalism (that co-incidentally, is based on Hindu historical identity in India), they form a perfect alliance serving mutual interests. In European countries, you will historically see political organizations suffixed “Popular Front”, which is generally an alliance of all left-wing parties withinin a country. The left-liberal-islamic nexus in India is just that suited to the Indian sociopolitical climate.    \n\n\n**I understand your point. I see how this alliance might work. But still it seems a bit unreasonable to suggest that all the students on the road, protesting in the universities, all the media personnel, the news papers, the magazines, would  do all of what you describe with such calculated intention. Maybe they really are just coming from a place of humanistic concern.**  \n\nI agree. But here you must pay attention to a crucial analogy: there are foot-soldiers in a battle, and then there are the generals, above them is the head-of-state, and often propping his or her power is the public. The reason why the solider fights is not the same reason the general fights, and that is not the same reason why the head-of-state goes to war, and the reason the public supports or condemns the battle might yet be different.  The head-of-state might have a personal interest, the general might be fighting for glory, the soldier for duty, and the public might be supporting the war because of perceived or real injustice on part of the enemy.   \n\nIt is the same with any ideology. The academicians, the professors of Marxism deeply versed in the  Gramscian and other Marxist thought, the media figureheads who\'ve sprung from the universities where this thought is taught, might be promulgating their ideology with complete awareness of what they are doing. Some of the people might also be aware. But the bulk of the public perhaps is fighting because it does not know. It has had it drilled into its head the values of “minority protection” and “Hindutva fascism” and “constitutional values” -- which, by the way, they simply use to flout legal precedants and launch into judicial activism – and the public might just be fighting now out of a sense of perceived injustice that they think the Hindus are inflicting on imaginary targets. That, and that the penetration of marxist values into the  cultural domain – the civil society, to use Gramsci\'s terminology – has ensured that such protestations are considered cool and righteous.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Also, Gramsci died in the early 1930s, what makes you say that his ideology is still active currently?** \n\n I\'ll name you some ideological currents that derive heavily from his thought, and have moved much farther in terms of their sophistication and competence at breaking nationalisms. Admittedly I\'m only versed sufficiently with Gramsci\'s thought, having not read with much depth the other schools. But they are: \n\n The **Frankfurt School**. First Marxist school to be set up in a democratic society, in Germany. Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse are its primary figures. This school came up with the subject of **critical theory**, which is a euphemism for an “ideological effort of representatives of Frankfurt School to challenge all previously accepted standards in every aspect of societal life from a Marxist perspective.”[vii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote7sym)  Critical theory is a mandatory course in English Literature deparments, and also History departments lately.   \n\nRudi Dutschke and his slogan “long march through the institutions,” which was his notion of subverting society by infilitrating academia, beauracracy, media, and so on over a long period of time. This started happening in the 60s and 70s, and has now reached the zenith, with left-wing inside all prominent insitutions that are responsible for maintaining civil society.  \n\nIn India, I can recall a few instances off the top of my head. The Subaltern school of history (which has, admittedly, had some credible historians too), of which Sudipto Kaviraj is a prominent figure, is influenced by Gramscian Marxism. Kaviraj believes that the idea of India was created in the 19th century with the colonial state (conveniently forgetting the Arrian, Megasthenes, Al-Biruni, and so many other ancient sources that define India as a definite geographical and cultural entity).  Yogendra Yadav is a disciple of his.  Then of course you have the journalist nexus, which I\'m sure I don\'t need to spell out.  \n\n\n**So to come back to the initial point ...** \n\n To come back to the initial point, which started this conversation. The reason that the left is omitting the crimes against Hindus and portraying the Hindus as evil in their narrative does not come out of misunderstanding, or a lack of knowledge on their part (“Maybe they just don\'t know what is happening. Maybe because they live in their ivory towers they\'re not acquainted with reality. If only they come to hinterland, to the towns in the lives of the common people, they would understand ...”. This is part of well-thought-out ideology that has been institutionalized all over the world, with added verve in the democratic countries.    \n\nIndian nationalism will have to fight a strong pitched battle against it. It will not cover your riots for you. It will not cover both sides. It is biased, certaintly, but who are you complaining of the bias to? Objectivity is merely a front, behind which is a left-wing agenda being worked at with tremendous intensity. It is sad that most foot-soldiers of the left-wing might not even be aware of the ideology they\'re promoting, but they\'re doing it nonetheless, and have to be equally be countered.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And how do you propose Indians stands their defenses against it?**  \n\nAs with all battles, it starts with recognizing the enemy. People generally think of Islamism as the threat. I do not deny it. But Islamism is a visible threat, it something that is so obvious you can\'t help but respond against it. Left-wing subversion is something that is a lot more devious. It\'s hazy, concealed, garbed in the constumes of secularism and superior humanistic morality, and unless you\'re educated in the subject, you can\'t even point to where and how it is taking place.    \n\nWhat is fortunate, is that the model for social analysis that the left has figured out are not exclusive to them. Gramsci\'s thought, stripped of its prescriptive values and used solely for its general model of the society, can just as well be put to the nationalist objective. The left, using these models, has been succesful in reaching the top echelons of the civil society. There is no reason why the right can\'t use it to further their objectives.    \n\nOne *can* use the concepts of consent, hegemony, dominant ideology, and so on to see where we\'re at. The left has been very succesful in manufacturing consent[viii](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote8sym) of the college students, and they\'ve done it by manipulating the civil society: by infiltrating culture, the movies, the books, the newspapers. Once we\'re sensitive to it, we can issue a counter-propaganda campaign. One can  and should borrow from one\'s foes that which can serve to one\'s own advantage.    \n\nOther than that, I do not know. I am yet to study the rules of political organization and agitation (which again, I will learn from the Marxists, and who\'ve specialized in this area for over a century and a half now; and also, Islam with its centralized mosque-maulvi-fatwa network[ix](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote9sym)). Indians are clearly bad at political orgnization, and this reflects itself not only in the civil society – compare what a weak crowd we\'ve been able to muster in favour of the CAA to how many people actually support it, the supporters-to-demonstrators ratio is pathetic – but also in the political diplomatic scenario (see, our failure to negotiate to our advantage in the Kashmir dispute)[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/submit#sdendnote10sym) Self-education helps.    And that\'s about it. For those who reached till the end, I hope you found something informative here.

If they want to keep their beliefs to themselves why take the burden of doing a door-to-door campaign?\n\nThey started with "we are here to share our faith to Hindus" then a bit later talked about their community and didn\'t told me they were Jehovah\'s Witnesses I only found about it when I took a look at the pamphlet which was carefully made to not to mention the term "Jehovah\'s Witnesses" it only has JW.ORG on it.\n\nAfter series of verse verifications &amp; debunking of their scripture they didn\'t want to stay a bit in my house and started making excuses to get out of there. The point here is I could make a bold move of inviting them for a discussion but the uneducated and poor lot of India would fall victim to their moves and convert into the faith in order to escape from caste issues or tempted to the benefits they offer with their financial aid. It\'s time we start awareness about the proselytization (esp. Christian conversion) to protect our culture and traditions. I suggest readers of this reddit post to provide some insight on the ways we can curb this alien faith that is being imposed on us. Despite its cultish identity Jehovah\'s witnesses draw huge amounts of funds. I heard they are even expanding into the lower rungs of our nation, i.e from cities to towns, from towns to villages. \n\nJai Bharatadesh.'<br />Author: 'Heroclueless'  id: 'fc1aee'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fc1aee/a_knock_on_the_door_turns_out_that_they_are/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Reforms are required in Islam for peaceful coexistence in the country'<br />Body: 'This post is courtesy u/pythonlover2 who cannot post on this sub right now because of his low karma. So I am posting on his behalf. \n\nI have never ever posted on reddit and most probably will not do it again (as I have learnt, one who has most of free time, wins online debates). I stumbled upon reddit and this sub a few days ago. I just wanted to put some of my views (if this needs to be posted somewhere else, please guide me):\n\n1. Islam at its core is violent. You have to accept it. Christianity was the same at one time. They reformed themselves mainly because they conceded that everything in Bible is not correct. Hinduism had developed the social practice of untouchability and sati, but they reformed (or are in the way of reform). Koran has some extremely violent verses against other religions. The problem is that when this thing is pointed out to them, they say it was contextual. But they also contradict themselves by saying that Koran is eternal. It is this problems which has led to problem of Islamic terrorism.\n\n2. Due to Koran being infallible and eternal, a Muslim is on an average much more conservative than any other person who follows other religion. They also are more violent. They will not hurt you when they are down and are in low in population, but they surely will once they gain power through any mean and are sufficient in numbers. This has been their pattern in history and they will repeat it. J&amp;K has given a glimpse of what is to come when they are in majority (anyone saying that the issue in J&amp;K is not an issue of separatism on the basis of Islam, just like Rohingyas, is living in a fool’s paradise).\n\n3. Koran is incompatible with democracy and humanity. As Dr. Ambedkar observed — “Islam is not a universal brotherhood of man. It is a brotherhood of Muslims, for Muslims only, with hatred against non-Muslims”.\n\nInitially I was not in this Hindu-Muslim debate (and I will be out the day few conditions are met, written below). However, hypocrisy of liberals and elites have compelled me to vote completely on this issue.\n\n1. As Dr. Ambedkar pointed out, a Muslim will always keep Islam above the nation. The only Muslim majority state in the country and the partition of India has shown this very clearly. Pakistani flags hoisted in Indian muslim ghettos, and muslims in India cheering for the Pakistani team during Ind-Pak cricket clashes adds fuel to the fire. They also refuse to sing Vande Mataram, the national song. Seriously , the photograph of a Muslim man kicking the Amar Jawan (spitting on the sacrifices made by the armed forces) still makes me furious. Thus, I am worried about the growing population of the Muslims in the country. Not learning from history is one of the fatal mistake a person can do.\n\n2. Hijab has become a symbol of women empowerment when Ghoongat and Mangalsutra are symbols of patriarchy? Liberals have sided with the same force which they were supposed to oppose (a very good article summarising this point — https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/05/25/the-rock-that-broke-liberalism). Rather than being liberals, they have become Islam apologists. They defend everything that is done in the name of Islam as “tolerance” of other’s culture and religion.\n\n3. Where is equivalence in FoE? MF Hussain can paint nude Indian gods and goddesses whereas a Hindu cannot even criticise the prophet? Either it will be two way, or no way. As someone pointed out "They protest violently at the slightest hint of perceived insult to Islam or muslims anywhere in the worlds. They protested against the depiction of Mohammad in Danish newspapers, protested against the American movie about the prophet, protested against Salman Rushdie back then and got his book banned in India, intimidated the organizers of a literary fair against inviting Rushdie even a couple of years back, protested against treatment of muslims in Myanmar, Palestine, etc. Most of these protests are violent and uncivilized, not to mention unreasonable. It is sickening when public property is destroyed, people are killed and order is disrupted in Indian cities over an imagined insult to Islam in some other corner of the world."\n\n4. Why has there been no reform in Muslim personal law?\n\n5. Wearing your identity as a Muslim is secular, but a Hindu doing the same is communal?\n\n6. Comparing RSS and BJP with Nazis and calling them terrorists? I mean seriously? Moreover, at the same time defending Islamic terrorism?\n\n7. Muslims used to vote on religious line for decades. Now what is the problem if Hindus do the same? Though I believe in not mixing religion with education and politics, the Hindus did not start it first.\n\n8. Selective highlight of crime and riot by main stream media.\n\nThe more elites and liberals will defend extremist Islam, the more there will be polarisation. It is bound to happen. I also don’t want a one-sided secularism. Either Muslims are treated the same as Hindus, or else if someone has to be appeased, then I would prefer Hindus for it. BJP’s rise can be simply attributed to this point.\n\nI think following things need to happen to stop it:\n\n1. Stop defending everything bad in Islam and moderate Muslims should strive to reform the religion. Either shun the violent verses in Quran or stop saying that the Quran is eternal.\n\n2. Enact UCC.\n\n3. Return the important (Mathura and Kashi) sites where temples have been razed and mosques have been built, back to Hindus. The mosques should be shifted respectfully. I still don’t understand why Muslims oppose this. By opposing such things, they show that they believe in the same mindset which medieval rulers used to have (which is not surprising at all. Remember, no reforms?). Muslims came as invaders, plundered our wealth, destroyed our temples, massacred our people. Their mindset has not changed at all. They just need the opportunity to do so.\n\n4. Leave the tribal mindset of Muslim brotherhood. If you can’t put the nation above your religion, simply emigrate to a Muslim country.\n\nYesterday I read that Maharashtra government is thinking about (though Shiv Sena has contradicted) reserving 5% seats for Muslims in public educational institutions. I mean seriously? After burning Delhi for few days because “religion cannot be the basis of a law”, you are just saying the opposite? I mean seriously? If the country has to be ruled by Hypocrites, I would prefer those who favour the Hindus. And unless this issue with Islam is not resolved, I will vote along this line only. India and Nepal are the only countries which are Hindu majority. United India (Pakistan + Bangladesh) and Afghanistan used to have Hindu or Buddhist majority. Now around 45% (don’t know exact number, but can be easily calculated) people are Muslims. I always want Hindus to be more than 75% in this country. It is important for the very secularism which the Islam apologists say they defend and the future of democracy.'<br />Author: 'Jorg_RedAncrath'  id: 'fbvli3'<br />Score:140<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbvli3/reforms_are_required_in_islam_for_peaceful/</li>

As soon as the videos of Tahir\'s deeds were out, following were the reactions.\n\n1. A flurry of pictures and videos showing brotherhood between people of all religions to ensure that the Tahir Hussain news did not gain too much momentum.\n\n2. Defending Kejriwal, saying he has been made the scapegoat for someone else\'s provocations and actions.\n\n3. AAP suspends Tahir, with a dramatic filmy statement of "If someone from AAP has made a mistake, give him double punishment".\n\nNo one becomes a councilor, or any such post without the party knowing exactly what the person brings to the table. Ex: BJP knows exactly what Pragya Thakur brings to the table, and they went ahead with her anyway. Similarly AAP definitely knew what Tahir brought to the table, not just the votes, but also the muscle power. They knew it, and AAP and Kejriwal, were right behind him to support him and his plans.\n\nNow, to further deviate from this debate, AAP has given permission to prosecute Kanhaiyya. \n\n1. The Left is bashing him saying he is just a BJP proxy.\n\n2. The other side is busy pointing out that the prosecutor appointed is himself a Kanhaiyya fan.\n\nAll of this totally deviates from the real betrayal Kejriwal and AAP have delivered to Delhi, which is the riots, that included the death of an IB officer among so many others.

Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because Kṛṣṇa was sitting by his side."  \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n  \n**Question 2 : What is the meaning of the word : durbuddheḥ ?**  \n**Answer 2 :**  "durbuddheḥ—evil-minded;"  \nRef : Bhagavad-Gita 1.23, Purport, Srila Prabhupada   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3va4cdtf1k41.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e7d1e6228d7c94c752e1b843dd748528b9fedc\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: "The west's awareness of India is rather insignificant"<br />Body: 'I see a lot of concern being raised due to western media houses publishing negative stories about India.\n\nIf you look at the author list - they are usually a select few and limited in number. Most of them are left leaning, probably got acquainted during left/congress raj.\n\nHaving an open mind by the west is largely limited to only a certain topics. The media house just push (look for) their confirmation bias, which in general says, "Hey look xyz country is so horrible, we live in a much better society." Additionally, "reporting this make us as human conscious society."\n\n If you talk to most above average people, they have a general idea about india. Most of their opinions get influenced by the NRIs they meet in daily life (uber, taxi drivers, accountants, delivery drivers, back end cooks, etc)\n\nDo they somewhat influence an audience?\n\n1. NRIs who generally dislike india, read negative news and say "thank god I left the country" - they are one target audience\n\n2. Foreigners who want to look for negative news about countries they generally or racially dislike.\n\n----\n\nI see a lot of people read wsj, etc articles and think "oh fuck, what a crazy opinion they\'ll form after reading this!"\n\n Truth be told, 99% dont care. Even today - india is a far off place, and stuff of spirituality. \n\nOnly concern is feeding leftist jihad meterial to NRIs who then spew more "I hate myself, my country, self loath.." But there is nothing much u can do about it.\n\nMost negative opinion is generated by indians from tire 2 and 3 cities who go abroad and behave in uncivic manner. \n\nSo, if u see negative news - just assume some narrow minded groups is just scratching each other\'s backs, with selective evidences to confirm each other\'s bias, and make money in the process. \n\nNo one cares until it affects them directly.

Guḍāka means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called guḍākeśa. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Kṛṣṇa. As a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he could not forget Kṛṣṇa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Kṛṣṇa's name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Kṛṣṇa can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa constantly. This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or samādhi. As Hṛṣīkeśa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, Kṛṣṇa could understand Arjuna's purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.  \n\n\n**Question 1 : Why Arjuna is referred to as Guḍākeśa in this verse ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is Kṛṣṇa consciousness ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6n4yijw30k41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=941b5792847ba8e06a51f6d9d27ed2df1d4d49eb\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fbpv0k'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbpv0k/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_124/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Our worrying, whining, &amp; arguing on social media is not going to change anything.'<br />Body: 'So much of the social media has been lit up after the Delhi riots and I got into argument with many people on Quora, Reddit, &amp; Twitter. And as I gave so much time to these argument I though it was worth pondering over whether what we as right wingers are doing is achieving anything at all or is there a possible better way to achieve the ideological goals that we want to achieve.\n\nI concluded that all the whining, worrying, and argumentation on social media is not going to help us. We must very clearly understand this point; specially the younger generation: we must find a better way than mere worrying, arguing, &amp; whining which will lead to realising of our ideological goals.\n\nThere is no doubt that democracy is game of perception. There is no possible way to know the complete truth of any event that happens in this country since every media platform hold its bias and either shows or hides a particular side of the event. Thus, one who holds the control over the narrative will win this perception-war. One who will posses the greater influence will come out as the winner. Old wars were fought with swords but the modern war is the fight of narrative and knowledge. And make no mistake, in this war of narrative your argument being logical or morally superior matters very little. Since, any sh*i that comes out of the mouth of an influential person will hold weight over any logical answer by a nobody.\n\nPerception and narrative is decided by influential reach and that is decided by news channels, movies, TV, blogging sites, historians, people at higher positions etc. And further influential reach is controlled by wealth and power; there is little doubt in that. Going further, wealth and power is achieved by people who have focused minds which are willing to act. Focus is everything and focus is achieved when we get rid of that which is ineffective or distractions.\n\nSo I will offer you a much better alternative that will help us win this narrative war — we must give up the vain distractions of whining, worrying, &amp; argumentation on social media. Instead each of us should invest our energy in a focused and efficient way towards what will actually make a difference, that is making ourselves capable, powerful, and wealthy. So strive towards starting a business, become a director, a lawyer, a writer or anything will provide you with power, wealth and influence.\n\nEven if our constant indulgence and activity on social media is making any difference it is not that significant at all. Some of you will argue that posting and working on social media is important and I will wholeheartedly agree and will add that we will have much bigger credibility and number of followers if we are successful and powerful. An average voter is more likely to believe an army officer, a lawyer, an entrepreneur etc than a random keyboard warrior on social media. Either you can work harder on building your social media influence or you work harder on your wealth and power (which also gives you followers); almost always influential reach &amp; credibility of the later will be greater.\n\nOnly influence is the true variable which will decide our victory or defeat. And influence we can achieve only through power and wealth. Further power and wealth are achieved by focused minds which act. Action is everything, and only action will help us achieve our ideological goals. Focused actions will give us the leash with which we will change the future of this country. And this is only to be achieved by people who instead of whining, worrying, &amp; arguing about the problems actually do something to change them; that is to find the solutions.\n\nFarewell'<br />Author: '23samyad'  id: 'fbpdmi'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbpdmi/our_worrying_whining_arguing_on_social_media_is/</li>

I mean there should be videos no?'<br />Body: 'Why do I feel like AAP\'s MLA Tashir Hussain and his gang  along with the criminal  gang targeted  both Hindus and Muslims to iginite a communal rift. Most of the Muslims that were killed in the riots were due to gunshot wounds. Most of the hindus that were killed were due to assault by mobs. \n\nPostmortem report by police \n\nhttps://twitter.com/Iyervval/status/1233070814485893121?s=19\n\nLike it just doesn\'t make any sense. Here is the video of a group of muslims possibly Tashir Hussain\'s criminal gang  shouting "Allah Hu Akbar" after killing Vinod.\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amansha58432073/status/1232133696125374464?s=19\n\nVideo of a hindu man who was close to vinod\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sharmaAvl/status/1233273820183531521?s=19\n\nThe mob is clearly visible there as you can see a really large   group. \n\nThe same MLA was found to have hosed petrol bombs, bricks, acid, stones and had his gang throwing those weapons from the roof.\n\n Video of his house\'s roof top showcasing sking shots, bricks, petrol bombs\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ShefVaidya/status/1233227091480580097?s=19\n\n\nVideo of his house being used to launch petrol bombs\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rahulpandita/status/1232670834851864576?s=19\n\nWhen Tashir Hussain\'s got info of Ankit Sharma he immediately sent his goons to pick him up and take him to his house.\n\nVideo of locals who witnessed him being dragged away by a group of people belonging to Tashir Hussain.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rahulpandita/status/1232672205609164800?s=19\n\nNote most of the muslim victims keep on saying they were attacked by hindus who had the backing of police. But I doubt this because police seems to not be in control of the situation. \n\nAdd to this the burning down of a BSF soldiers house. Why did the mob shout "come here Pakistani get your citizenship" it\'s as if they were targetting a hindu and why specifically this house which suprisingly belonged to a BSF soldier. If it were a Hindu mob they would\'ve also burnt down other Muslim peoples house to in that area too but nothing like that occured. But surprise surprise BSF soldier\'s house was specifically targe5tted. It\'s like they knew before hand of this. The chilling part that makes me doubt that this was done by  Tashir Hussain\'s gang is because they shouted, " come here pakistani get your citizenship". Why because they will implying he was a hindu refugee. \n\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/india/bsf-jawans-house-burned-down-in-khajuri-khas-by-rioters-shouting-come-here-pakistani-get-your-citizenship-2518989.html\n\n\nFurther more circumstantial evidence is mosque, madrassa and Arun modern public school getting torched. According to people the mob was wearing helmets to shield their identity. The same mob was responsible for burning down those places? \n\nIf you look at the mosque he doesn\'t look that burnt compared to the Arun Modern Modern public school. Hinting towards the fact that they didn\'t want to cause a huge damage.\n\nImages of property inside mosque and madrassa\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rahulpandita/status/1232937325337833474?s=19\n\nCompare the conditions of the interior of the mosque with the school \n\nhttps://twitter.com/rahulpandita/status/1232934037083213825?s=19\n \n\nSame area one was completely torched while one was made too look like it was attacked. Possibly hinting at collusion or an act to instigate hate between muslims and Hindus. \n\nI will do more research and put out circumstantial and hard evidence pointing towards the fact that Tashir Hussian might have been the one going around destroying hindu\'s and muslim\'s property to stir up hate.'<br />Author: 'Lancer008'  id: 'fbp57z'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fbp57z/why_is_media_showing_only_muslims_plight_why_are/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 1.21-22'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : Why Lord Krishna has been addressed as infallible by Arjuna in this verse ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee\'s assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master of all circumstances."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 1.21-22, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rupoaqc09uj41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45a2285077d942341f0f1bec3c30aba67b232348\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: "A Simple 'To-do' for Hindus in light of recent events"<br />Body: "1st of all it's important to understand that there are 2 kinds of people in the world (&amp; thus all communities too) -\n\n* about 5% are thinkers (of which 5%-4% = 1% are doers)\n* and the rest are followers without much original thinking (call it circumstances, Karma, genetics, whatever).\n\nBe a thinker &amp; a Doer, the sustenance of Sanatan Dharma requires you to be so! Don't remain a follower alone. Your and Dharmic destiny is in your hands. Hence, you also need to strenghten your hands.\n\nI'll keep it practical\n\n# 1. Accumulate Power\n\n* If you are in college or school, STUDY HARD and WORK your ass off to get into power or to make your thing when the time comes.\n* Do not shun the professions which are generally left-leaning and jihadi sympathizing. The only reason why they are so because we have given ground to them and don't bother to fight to establish ourselves there.\n* So get into Civil/Public Services (all levels bottom to IAS). Wonder why Jamia keeps churning out IAS's ? well bcz they work long term, to occupy power you have to work hard\n* Be lawyers, politicians, journalists, academicians, economists, NGO wallahs,etc. Depending on what you wish to be, choose these careers. Dont stop even if you're the only dharmic stuck in that field. Others will follow.!\n* know this that there will be continuous onslaught of BS in these streams on you and your Dharmic identity. Keep persevering.\n\n# 2. Do not try to avoid risks in life - Be Entrepreneurial\n\n* Be entrepreneurial, open your own business and employ Dharmic people. This will ensure livelihood security for you and for Dharma. Plus the proceeds from the profits can be utilised for Dharmic causes.\n\nUnabashedly use the power hence accumulated for Dharmic well-being (&amp; not personal well-being). Be prudent so that you can remain in power for as long as possible. But always remember that the power is for Dharma not for you.\n\n# 3. Volunteer\n\n* Whatever your vocation or skills, use a part of that to volunteer at the nearest Gowshala, Mandir, Matth, any other Dharmic cause.\n* Fix a target, say 10% of all weekly work hours shall be volunteered for Dharma. For example, if I am a doctor and if I can visit the local matth to treat/examine people once a week, it'll increase the goodwill of the matth and hence of Dharma. Learn from the Sikhs.\n* Also, join the local shakha of sangh or any other Dharmic cause org.\n* If there's none, then start one!\n\n# 4. Donate\n\n* if you're employed, always donate atleast 10% of your income for Dharmic causes.\n\n# 5. Be a part of and drive community\n\n* Weekly visit your nearest temple and make others visit too. This is the only common places where issues of the Dharmic people can be discussed. Raise and discuss and spread awareness.\n* Know your neighbour, you local politician, local VHP/RSS/other org guys.\n* Maintain a strict vigil on any demographic changes, changes in property constitution\n\n# 6. Be aware and knowledgeable\n\n* Know [Dharma](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/ebinv2/repost_a_brief_introduction_to_sanatan_dharma_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). If you don't then you can be easily misled and guilt-tripped into working against Dharma.\n* Don't yield even an inch while defending Dharma. However, be smart and prudent. Know that you (the individual) are an investment for Dharmic cause. The investment must last long.\n* Read a lot. Maintain a reading habit. Start with works of Sitaram Goel, RC Majumdar etc. There are more knowledgeable folks than me who can add to this reading list.\n\n# 7. Spread awareness\n\n* So that we have as less a percentage as possible of dhimmies.\n* In your families, neighborhoods, classrooms, offices. Don't get into conflicts but also don't just let misled people remain misled.\n\n# 8. Don't fund your own slaughter\n\n* Don't use any halal certified thing (goods or service) even if it is cheaper. Check out the [halala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUIaWa0tvRw)\\-[nomics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFW-X_VYvZU) (2 parts, links added) talk on Srijan channel on YT\n* Dont watch propaganda channels like NDTV, IndiaToday &amp; aajtak (YES!!), ABP (sorry Rubika Liyaqat), BBC etc even if they might have a few virat anchors. Know that its taqqiya by these agencies. Instead watch Republic, IndiaTV, ZeeNews, Wion, etc\n* Don't buy commie/namazi newspapers or magazines like TheHindu, IE, Tribune, Deccanherald, National herald, Outlook, TIME, IndiaToday. Go for regional chads like Dainik Jagran, Dainik Bhasker etc\n* This is because each view/subscriber/click adds to their traffic which they can use to get more premium for adverts on their network.\n* **This is not a support for cancel culture**. Know the vital difference between\n\n&gt;Organisations that follow an anti-Dharmic ideology and therefore undermine Dharma. I have tried to list these ones above and one must also include those that are supported by Church, Ulema &amp; Commies again for Anti Dharmic activities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**These must be totally shunned. They shouldn't get a penny from us.**\n\nVersus\n\n&gt;Organisations that support something that's hip or popular or because certain ideologues have infiltrated their ranks (like Amazon, Netflix).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Here we have to be vocal about stuff that's anti-Hindu and make it uneconomical for them to hurt us just like the treatment meted out to Deepika for her JNU stunt.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Those contemplating more revolutionary things need to 1st consider the present state of Hindus that the vast majority they wouldn't even fight (even verbally or in courts) for their neighbors. **Presently the Hindu mind-set is all about**\n\n&gt;***Roti-Kapda-makaan (bread &amp; house), immediate nuclear family and the aspiration for an NRI son/son-in-law and a grand wedding!***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To transform this attitude and to organize Hindus, **steps 3 to 8 are listed**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You can't hope that they speak in one voice asking for Hindu causes including changes to laws without their being a pan-Hindu awareness and sense of community duty. The wide vocal anti-CAA support is actually driven by elite Hindus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Realistically speaking the really Dharmic Hindu population is close to 50% rather than the oft quoted 80% and the rest are stuck in their own virtue-signalling bubbles. But even the 50% is stuck in their own blinkered self-service.\n\n**We'll have to do all of this our whole life !!**\n\nDo this and inspire your kids to do the same for Dharma. There's a price for everything. This is the minimum price for ensuring our security and sustenance"<br />Author: 'Puckshi'  id: 'fb9izk'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fb9izk/a_simple_todo_for_hindus_in_light_of_recent_events/</li>

Much of the blame has been assigned to the moderators of Reddit India and in particular their track record of censorship.\n\nAs early Redditors would remember, Reddit India was mysteriously created the same person who created Reddit Pakistan – [u/qgyh2](https://www.reddit.com/u/qgyh2/). (Source: Reddit India[ in 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20120203112402/https://reddit.com/r/india/), [r/Pakistan in 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20150310081909/https://reddit.com/r/pakistan)\xa0– The first name in the moderator list was the creator of the sub) However, this person mysteriously disappeared around 8 months back, only to be replaced by a much more sinister set of moderators on Reddit India. And around 2 months back, Reddit had an investment of over $200 mn, from none other than the [Chinese censorship major – Tencent](https://en.softonic.com/articles/tencent-reddit-investment?amp=1). Things have not quite been the same, since then.\n\nRecently a whole host of readers have taken to other forums to publicly complain about the anti-India and pro-Pakistan narratives being dished out on Reddit India\n\nOne of the readers [u/h0ysala](https://www.reddit.com/u/h0ysala/) had noticed a discussion where a map that was posted was incorrect with what was officially denoted as boundaries by India’s MEA. On letting other readers know that the boundaries were incorrect, [u/h0ysala was simply banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/alncis/uh0ysala_simlpy_complains_about_using_legal/) with a message “We don\'t want Bhakts!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](csgy86wzcoj41 " u/h0ysala gets banned for posting the correct map! ")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIn another post, [a reader complains](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/an047n/randia_mods_remove_all_posts_showing_anarchy/) that the moderators of Reddit India have deleted all the content that exposed how anarchy was prevalent in West Bengal!\n\nJust today, yet another reader [u/HR12India](https://www.reddit.com/u/HR12India/) got mercilessly attacked and banned by the moderators of Reddit India. Why? Because he had commented something that praised India on another sub! For which the moderators of Reddit India told them they have the right to not allow anyone who speaks in favor of India!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](t3v0qtc9doj41 " User banned by Mods of Reddit India")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThat was it. No warning, no discussion, speaking good things about India meant you were not welcome to post in Reddit India.\n\nAt this rate, one really wonders what is the purpose of Reddit India, and why it is called Reddit India if speaking about India’s success was not welcome there!\n\nThe purpose, however, is not that hard to see; for users who have been on Reddit for some time only know too well how the moderators of Reddit India have suppressed pro-India content and instead have blatantly promoted pro-Pakistan content, anti-Hindu propaganda. Many have feared this sub is controlled by either Pakistan agents or given Tencent’s control of Reddit, Chinese agents. Seeing the propaganda spread on Reddit India, both don’t seem far fetched.\n\nFor example, another user claims that Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi was behind the cowardly Pulwama attacks were over 40 brave Indian Jawaans were martyred by Pakistan based terrorists. In a post titled “[Say whatever you want. But I believe that Modi is behind all this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arjz4k/say_whatever_you_want_but_i_believe_that_modi_is/)“, he makes his wild allegations. This post was never removed or censored by the moderators. Instead, it is still up, despite the fact that the person who posted this makes no logical arguments whatsoever, nor provides any facts to back up his claim.\n\n \n\nOne of the persons replying to this post, [u/Daliya\\_La\\_ma](https://www.reddit.com/user/Daliya_La_ma) says “Modi may or may not be behind it but Modi is the biggest beneficiary of this rise in tension and possible subsequent conflict.” Many have suspected this user of being a Pakistan sympathizer. He certainly fits the bill – his account was created only around a month back on14th Jan 2019, right around the time the Chinese company Tencent invested millions into Reddit.\n\nAnother user [u/xinamongolic](https://www.reddit.com/user/xinamongurglic) replies on the same post that “I have no doubt about it. It all looks organized.” On checking this user’s profile, his account was only created on 9th February 2019 and almost all of his posts are biased against India. [Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arw4vb/bjp_mp_sakshi_maharaj_seen_laughing_waving_at/egq5zxx/?context=1) of this same user “xinamongolic” says “Not politicians, but Terrorists and Goondas who spew hatred and create Riots and Murders, as in the BJP party. They are happy this cuz happened, that’s what they needed to boost in the polls.”\n\nSurprisingly, this comment has around 20 upvotes, which indicates somehow 20 people like this comment.\n\nAlmost all of these user xinomongolic comments are filled with generic hate and very little substance. In [another place,](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arwgm7/mamata_banerjee_raises_question_on_timing_of/egq5b0p/) he says “Why not? Is there a strict rule that BJP cannot go at any length to win elections? The Riot, Murders, use EVM machines, Hate speeches, polarisation and whatever shit you can imagine BJP are Masters in it.”\n\nAt this point, another reader [u/PB49](https://www.reddit.com/u/PB49/) replies to him that “You are out of touch with reality if you believe this shit lmao”, which again suspiciously downvoted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](hgkwkvuidoj41)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThis kind of polarised comment along with suspicious voting patterns leaves many regular users of Reddit bewildered.\n\nIn yet another blatant attempt at censorship, a recent post by [u/kashmiriiprincess](https://www.reddit.com/user/kashmiriiprincess)\xa0about the Freedom in the World 2019 report by Freedom House [was censored within 15 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as04l0/oh_so_its_not_really_azad_kashmir_after_all/). The reason? The report showed that India had a better ranking than Pakistan (duh) and surprisingly, even the Indian state of Kashmir had a higher ranking than the whole of Pakistan.\n\nThankfully, we managed to obtain a screenshot of the post:\n\n![img](077ago7ldoj41)\n\n \n\nIt is extremely suspicious why the moderators of an Indian forum would remove a post that showcased India has better freedom ratings than Pakistan. Unless of course, the moderator’s priorities lie elsewhere.\n\nConsidering all the shady and dubious censorship and propaganda, we can see that at one end, we have people posting positive comments about India who seem to get censored and banned.\n\nOn the other end, comments that have no basis or facts seem to get promoted highly if they are against India. Baseless allegations are not removed. All of this, on a forum, called Reddit India.\n\nIn fact, many users have brought this suspicious manipulation to the attention of the CEO of Reddit Inc, Steve Huffman.\n\nVery recently, just 5 days back, one user [brought](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/aq9h0k/reddits_2018_transparency_report_and_maybe_other/egfbj1e/) to Steve’s attention in graphic detail all the moderation abuse, censorship, and propaganda on Reddit India, including incidents of political bias and apprehensions of Pakistani or Chinese takeover over the moderator accounts. His post got over 100+ upvotes, thus symbolizing a large portion of Reddit users who agreed with what was said here. Steve’s response? He doesn’t even acknowledge the post!\n\nOn the same post, yet another user [brought](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/aq9h0k/reddits_2018_transparency_report_and_maybe_other/egeiou2/) this to Steve’s attention, again to no avail. This was yet again not even acknowledged! Despite the fact that Steve had replied to several comments on the page, he chooses to not even acknowledge the pertinent questions relating to moderation abuse on Reddit India, asked by 2 different users.\n\n \n\nAt this point, it would not be out of order to conclude that the Reddit CEO is both well aware of complicit in this systematic abuse of moderation and publishing of select narratives on a sub that is designed to discuss all aspects of India. As to why this is happening, the truth remains elusive. Best guesses include both Pakistani or Chinese take over, in an attempt to manipulate Indian social media users with elections right around the corner.\n\nMost readers of Reddit and citizens of India would, at this point,\xa0 request the Indian authorities and law enforcement agencies to take a note of this systematic abuse on such a prominent social media network. Recently, [Twitter was hauled](https://www.opindia.com/2019/02/parliamentary-panel-summons-twitter-india-officials-to-explain-allegations-of-anti-right-wing-bias/) in front of the Parliamentary Committee to answer charges of shadow banning selective content, while exhibiting a complete lack of transparency. A similar approach would be appreciated for Reddit Inc as well.\n\nSimultaneously, agencies such as CBI, NIA, and State Government cybercrime task forces could also take cognizance of the narratives being stitched together on this site that are patently anti-Indian in nature. In fact, it would be pertinent to investigate the accounts posting constant hate and terrorism-related content on Reddit, to identify if they have any ties with known terror organizations. Over the past week, several anti-social comments have been left across social media by people harboring terror thoughts against India, and state police across the country have been cracking down on these crimes under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 as well as Sections 120(B), 123, 504, 505 and 507 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\n\n \n\nA solution to the Reddit problem would help in bringing much-needed transparency in one of the top social networks that Indians use today.\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is the first part of several articles that expose a systematic link between\xa0moderators of Reddit India and anti-national agents and miscreants. The writer is a user of Reddit, and was banned from Reddit India for stating that “India has a better space program than several other countries”. The opaque moderation and false narratives being promoted on Reddit India are documented in detail on [r/IndiaDiscussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/). The writer suggests other subs such as [r/IndiaNews](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianews) and [r/IndiaSpeaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks) which have a much more transparent moderation structure including audit logs of moderator actions.\n\n**Legal Note**: Reddit being a company registered in\xa0the United States Of America notifies that it is not bound by laws of India. The writer strongly disagrees with this, as the Information Technology Act and Rules of India mandate every social media company operating in India to follow Indian laws. Reddit is also legally bound to reveal information of perpetrators of crime through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between India and the United States of America, and Letters Rogatory can be facilitated via the Central Agencies Section of the Department of Legal Affairs under the Ministry of Law and Justice of the Government of India. The moderators of Reddit India have also created a twitter account [u/RedditIndia](https://www.reddit.com/u/RedditIndia/) which is bound by the laws of India and is required to facilitate disclosure of the information sought by any Indian investigative agency.'<br />Author: 'RealMan193'  id: 'favku9'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/favku9/the_official_subreddit_of_india_where_mods/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 1.20'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What were some of the auspicious conditions favoring Arjuna for an assured victory over the Kauravas ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "The emblem of Hanumān on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanumān cooperated with Lord Rāma in the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, and Lord Rāma emerged victorious. Now both Rāma and Hanumān were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord Kṛṣṇa is Rāma Himself, and wherever Lord Rāma is, His eternal servitor Hanumān and His eternal consort Sītā, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord Kṛṣṇa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 1.20, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gotu247c0nj41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa293cb05bcad8bb0e45169df6deb0718d85218\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Under the Cong the largest mass sterilisation program of humans ever, took place. Sanjay Gandhi was a known Islamophobe and he forcibly sterilised millions of Muslims.\n\nPolice literally butchered Muslim families in the heart of Delhi and not a single media house reported it. Not even one (Turkoman)\n\nNellie massacre - 2,000 Muslims butchered in 3 hours. Not even one person was sentenced for it.\n\nYou are either a delusional Pakistani or a pseudo Indian, both have no concept of history and who only spew propaganda.\n\nMoving on,\n\nYour lies on the state of Guj and Muslims I have already debunked. I will copy paste that bit below this.\n\nFact - Pakistani Sunni brothers have butchered 10\'s of thousands of Shiites.\n\nFact - Ahamadiyas are Constitutionally attacked and declared not Muslims (not in India though)\n\nFact - like Hitler and the Jews, you lot till recently required non Muslims to have the stamp "not a Muslim" in your id cards iirc including your passport.\n\nFact - just last week a court of yours (a literal actual court) ruled that kidnap, rape and conversion of a minor is legal because she had her periods! Yeah that\'s right. A literal court in your pathetic excuse of a country ruled this way.\n\nFact - your own PM admitted that 50-60,000 Armed Jihadis roam it\'s streets\n\nFact - you have and continue to succour terrorists from OsamaJI to hafeez sayedJi\n\nFact - your second PM, Khwaja Nazimuddin famously declared that religion is not a private affair\n\nFact - Zia passed the hudood ordinances, all inspired by the Sharia(one of which requires women to provide 4 male witnesses for rape... Which is why ladies and gents Pakistan doesn\'t have a "rape problem" because it has legitimatised rape. Period.\n\nFact - Ahamadiyas are endlessly persecuted (they even released a report on this)\n\nFact - Sikhs have been systematically targeted for persecution and harassment including imposition of Jizya! In this day and age. Even last month the Nanaksahib the holiest Sikh shrine was targeted by mobs.\n\nFact -every single month 50 Hindu and also Xtian and Sikh women are kidnapped and converted forcibly after being raped. Yet your state refuses to pass any anti conversion law.\n\nFact - your state prescribed syllabus mandates Quran reading, even for non Muslims. Your textbooks glorify Islam while denigrating other faiths\n\nFact - your Council of Islamic Ideology is a literal constitutional body that guides your parliament, the govt and even your judiciary and hold unofficial veto powers on any and all bills.\n\nYour filthy state is an Islamic theocracy in all but name, it promotes Islamic terror, is morally bankrupt (your PM apparently has no knowledge of the Chinese persecution of Uiguyr Muslims, Turkish persecution of Kurdish Muslims and Saudi persecution of Yemeni Muslims.... The few Paisa they throw your way to keep your economy afloat must be really important)\n\nIf you are in any way a balanced Pakistani, you will recognize some if not all of this. If you still argue for Pakistan, then you are so brainwashed that there is literally no argument with you.'<br />Author: 'Backyardleaf'  id: 'farjj8'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/farjj8/the_pakistani_troll_copypasta/</li>

He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee's assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master of all circumstances.\n\nAs a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Lord Krishna has been addressed as infallible by Arjuna in this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myeipo4askj41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72f74bc46dd9ea3aa019ef9c22a526f65bd8206f\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fanj77'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fanj77/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_12122/</li>

Seriously, why does a Hindu not deserve the same level of concession and compensation for the hard work they put in? Why does the relative of a ruling class (yeah, don’t forget what the Mustards were doing from the 1200s to the 1950s). \n\nWe also use faith-based Personal Law, which goes against every interpretation of the meaning of the word “secularism”. \n\nWhat the fuсk man?

The emblem of Hanumān on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanumān cooperated with Lord Rāma in the battle between Rāma and Rāvaṇa, and Lord Rāma emerged victorious. Now both Rāma and Hanumān were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord Kṛṣṇa is Rāma Himself, and wherever Lord Rāma is, His eternal servitor Hanumān and His eternal consort Sītā, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord Kṛṣṇa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.  \n\n\n**Question 1 : What were some of the auspicious conditions favoring Arjuna for an assured victory over the Kauravas ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwszkc0toej41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5286784fcb5bfc40b633dfe8815944743033644\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fa7kdq'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fa7kdq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_120/</li>

In fact, now they’re even saying that — if you look at Nevada, that’s all messed up with the vote count, and some of them are questioning the votes, but certainly Iowa was — I’ve never seen anything like it and I’ve been watching politics for a long time.  Been involved in it now for a while.  And I’ve never seen anything like it.\n\nSo — but I think the fact that there — you know, there’s an election coming up.  I think, you know, a lot of people think we’re going to win the election.  I feel we’re going to win the election because what we’ve done for jobs and for the military, for the vets, what we’ve done for healthcare, what we’ve done for healthcare is incredible, including giving options to Obamacare at a far less cost.  A cost that’s much less.\n\nBut if you look at all of the things that we’ve done — rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts — that brought all of you people; that’s why you’re in the United States.  And then you’re very happy and you’re going in with more.\n\nBut I think until the election is over, people are — and it’s not just Bernie Sanders.  It’s others, too.  I think if people thought that there was a real chance of them getting it, it really is going to keep the market down.  Now, the market has been up 70, 80, 90 percent depending on your definition of — you can look at about 16 different definitions.  But the country has been incredible.  It had one bad day; that was yesterday.  Futures are up today a little bit.\n\nBut if you look at what we’ve done in terms of the percentage, even taking 1,000 points off, the numbers are incredible.  If the other side had gotten in, I think it would’ve been 50 or 60 points down from where it was, because the big thing again — these regulation cuts — they were going put more regulations on.  You couldn’t — you were being strangled.  Whether it was Keystone Pipeline, Dakota Access Pipeline, 48,000 jobs between the two of them.  So many other things.  I mean, nothing was getting done.  Nothing was going to be built.  It would take you 20 years to get a highway approved.  A small highway.  It’d take you 20 years to get a roadway approved.  And it was out of control.\n\nWe have that way down.  That number is way, way down.  And they may not get approved, because if it doesn’t work from a safety standpoint or an environmental standpoint, we don’t want to get it approved either.  We’re not going to let them have it approved.  But it’s going to end up taking two years, and we’re trying to get it down to less than that.\n\nAnd if it doesn’t work, at least you’re going to find — and how about working on something for 21 years, and you find out that it just got rejected?  So, half of your working life — of course, nowadays with people retiring so early, it’s more than half, right?  But half of your working life, you’re trying to get an approval.  And then after 20 or 21 years, they reject you.  We reject — three to two.  That happens.  It happens.\n\nSo we’ve done a real job.  But I think that, frankly, until the election is over, our market — it’s phenomenal, but our market will jump thousands and thousands of points, if I win.  If I don’t win, you’re going to see a crash like you’ve never seen before.  (Laughter.)  I really mean it, too.  Okay.\n\nAnybody else?  Yes, sir.  Please.\n\nMR. GOENKA:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m B.K. Goenka, from Welspun Group.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.\n\nMR. GOENKA:  We have invested around $400 million and created around 1,500 jobs.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I actually follow you guys, you know — what you’re investing.\n\nMR. GOENKA:  And thank you very much for clearing the Keystone pipeline.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\n\nMR. GOENKA:  That was a big thing — immediately, once you become the President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\n\nMR. GOENKA:  And all the pipes are manufactured now in the U.S. and that’s a big thing.  (Inaudible) at home.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That was one of the things I said.  Right?  I put a little note, in handwriting: You have to make the pipe in the USA.  Right?  On the bottom.  They said, “Sir, this will take two weeks to get.”  I said, “No, it doesn’t.”  You have to.\n\nNow, we had a little problem because they already bought the pipe, right?  And that was a little bit, you know, unfair to them, I thought.  So we had to sort of let them do what they had to do.  But they had bought much of the pipe.  And Dakota Access pipeline was already built, except for the one river area that I freed up for them.  So it was great.\n\nWell, that’s good.  So, is that what you do?\n\nMR. GOENKA:  Yeah.  And we are really like at home, absolutely.  And after all your tax cut and reforms, it’s really a big, big thing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  That’s very nice to say.  I appreciate.  Thank you for the investment.\n\nYes, sir.  Please.\n\nDR. REDDY:  Mr. President, congratulations.  You’re doing an outstanding job in terms of developing the economy and the world, too.  My name is Mohan Reddy.  (Inaudible) company called Cyient — a technology company.  But more (inaudible) from the technology (inaudible) perspective, this industry had gone through a tremendous amount of (inaudible).  We are now making a large investment in the U.S., hiring thousands — hundreds of thousands of people right now.  But we still have some challenges in terms of regulation issues, especially administrative and legislative.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.  I know that.  Yeah.\n\nDR. REDDY:  So if you can kindly look into that, we’d be very grateful too.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we are.  Now, some of the regulations have to go through what they call a “statutory process,” where you started to cut — we have the Secretary of Commerce here, and Wilbur knows exactly what this is all about.\n\nYou have a statutory process.  So we’re going to cut regulations, but we have to give a 90-day notice.  Then we have to give 120 days.  Then we have to give 30 days.  And we’re in that process now, with respect to a lot.\n\nNo, we’re going to cut a lot more regulations.  No — no — and we’re going to also have regulations because I think you need regulation for safety and for environmental.\n\nBut no President has ever cut anywhere close to what we’ve done.  And I’ve done it in three years, and some of them have been for eight.  In one case, it’s more than eight.  But no President has come close.\n\nBut we are in statutory environments where we have to go — we have one where we have to wait six months before we do phase two, which is — and there’s four or five phases, but they’re all in a pipeline to get cut.  And there’s a certain period in about seven or eight months from now where a lot of them are going to be gone.  But we go through the process.  But you’ve seen a big difference.\n\nDR. REDDY:  Yes, sir.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Good.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  It’ll only get better, too.\n\nYes, sir.  Please.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  A warm welcome, President Trump.  I’m Mukesh Ambani from Reliance Industries.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  We are investors in the United States in the energy sector (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Big one.  Yeah.\n\nMS. AMBANI:  We have over seven billion —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Seven billion.  Big one.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right, sure.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  Of course, we also take (inaudible) and bring it to India (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right, exactly.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  (Inaudible.)\n\nThe other thing is that the United States has been — again, small companies and large companies have been key partners in transforming India’s telecom (inaudible).  (Inaudible) last few years, 4G network.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.  You’re doing 4G.  Are you going to do 5G too?\n\nMR. AMBANI:  We’re going to do 5G.  We’re the only network in the world that doesn’t have —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Huawei.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  — a single Chinese component.  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s good.  Good.  Put a bid in.  (Laughter.)\n\nMR. AMBANI:  (Inaudible.)\n\nI have to thank you personally for your leadership, not only like what you’ve done in the U.S. but the entire (inaudible) effect on all of us.  In India, we could have never imagined the income tax rates have gone down with Prime Minister Modi —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They followed us.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  So all of us in the business community are grateful, and I think that also a (inaudible), who (inaudible) acquisitions and (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.  Right.  They’re getting approved a lot quicker.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  They’re getting approved, and we hope that that will continue for Indian companies, particularly in the energy —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, it will be as long as I’m here.  But if the wrong person gets elected, that won’t happen at all. (Laughter.)   And everything will come to a halt, and your unemployment rate will go up to eight or nine or ten.  And a lot of bad things will happen.\n\nAnd that has — you know, it is holding back.  There’s no question about it.  I mean, I think we’re favored to win.  Somebody said 65 percent.  But 65 percent means there’s 35 percent of something that people don’t want.  And it would be devastating because the economy has never been as good as it is right now.\n\nIt’s being held back by the fact that we have an election coming up.  And I don’t think there’s anybody, frankly, on this side — on the other side that’s going to be very inspirational.  It certainly doesn’t look like it.  So we’ll see what happens.  Thank you.\n\nMR. AMBANI:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Great job you’ve done.  Yeah.  Fantastic.\n\nYes, sir.  Please.\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  We have a small company.  My name is Sethuram.  I am a CEO of a company called Thirumalai Chemicals.  We are putting up (inaudible) plant in West Virginia.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How much?\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  Seventy million dollars to start with.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Seventy what?\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  Seven-zero million dollars to start with, and then going up to 400 million (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  It’s nice when you can say that’s a small company.  Right?\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  The support that the West Virginia government has given us is excellent.  We are proud to be there.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great state.  Those people are incredible.\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  Yeah.  The honorable governor and senators have been excellently supporting us.  We need a little bit of banking (inaudible) support from that area, and we’ll be discussing with various banks too.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’ll get that done.  So you’re dealing with the governor — the governor?  He’s a great governor, actually.\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  He’ll get it done.  Good.  Thank you very much.\n\nMR. SETHURAM:  Thank you very much.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\n\nYes, sir.  Please.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  Thanks for the opportunity, Mr. President.  I’m (inaudible) of (inaudible).  We’ve actually made new acquisitions in the U.S. in the last 12 years, totaling about $12 billion.  First company from (inaudible) in aluminum (inaudible).  (Inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Mostly aluminum?  Mostly aluminum?\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How is that going?  How’s it all going?\n\nPARTICIPANT:  It’s doing very well.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We helped you a lot — right? — with the tariffs.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  So we just signed an agreement to (inaudible) —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  — which is also in the same space as aluminum (inaudible) based out of Cleveland.  Cleveland.  And I want to (inaudible) and thank you, because we (inaudible) approval absolutely on time.  (Inaudible) is the company (inaudible), which is why we’re (inaudible) approval.  And we actually got it a few weeks before (inaudible).  And I wanted to thank you for that.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You got it very quickly.  If I weren’t elected, the aluminum business in the United States would be absolutely dead and the steel business would be dead too, frankly.  What we did.  You know, they were dumping steel all over the place and bad things were happening.  And it wasn’t good dumping either.  It was real — it was sand steel; it was garbage.  And we got that straightened out.  So, good.\n\nBut the aluminum business has made a big comeback.  That’s good.  That’s good.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  And we also have a company called (inaudible) Chemicals, which is the largest producer of (inaudible).  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So your total investment was 12, did you say?\n\nPARTICIPANT:  That’s right.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How much?  $12 billion?  That’s a big investment.  That’s a big investment.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  Twelve billion dollars.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  That’s good.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  We have revenue of $12 billion (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s big.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible) because whatever goes on in the government, (inaudible) really impact us.  (Inaudible.)  And I must say that your policy of less regulations, and tax cuts, and  appropriate protection for (inaudible) from China (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And it means jobs.  And we just signed the deal with China, and they’re going to be spending $250 billion a year now on our country.  Fifty billion will go — forty to fifty will go to the farmers for the purchase of farm product.  But China has been — you know, great.  It’s going to be a great deal.  We’re very happy with it.  They’re going to take care of their other problem, I hope, quickly.  But we’re going to be — it’s going to be an amazing deal.  Okay?\n\nThank you.  Great job.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nMR. PAREKH:  Hello.  I’m Salil Parekh from Infosys.  We made tremendous investments in the U.S. in the past two years — about $525 million.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nMR. PAREKH:  Twenty-four thousand employees in the U.S.  Six new centers in different states.  So we’re really grateful for all the approaches (inaudible) changes that have come in, both on taxes and on regulations.  We see the (inaudible) in your economy to be a tremendous boost for the technology work that we do.  (Inaudible) and I’m grateful for the work that you do.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you.  Great job.  I know your company.  Great job.  And, you know, we now also have it so money can come in.  When your money is offshore, you can bring it in.  Before, it was impossible, virtually — both bureaucratically and the rate was so high that nobody would pay it.  So nothing came in.\n\nNow we have billions and billions of dollars.  Apple is bringing in $350 billion and they’re building plants.  I just left one — they just opened one in Texas; I just left it.  And they’re building another one, and a lot of things are happening.  Great things.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nPlease.\n\nMS. HAMIED:  Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\n\nMS. HAMIED:  My name is Samina Hamied and I’m from Cipla.  As India’s third-largest pharmaceutical company —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\n\nMS. HAMIED:  — we have invested (inaudible) billion in the United States (inaudible).  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Great job.  I know what you’ve done.  Great job.  Thank you.\n\nSo I want to thank you.  Go ahead.  Let’s go.  I was just going to say, “Get out of here,” but everyone wants a question now, huh?  There’s a young — young, brilliant businessman.  Go ahead.\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  President Trump, thank you for the opportunity.  I’m Ritesh.  I run Oyo Hotels.  It’s a young startup.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  In the last six years, we’ve grown to become a leading hotel chain worldwide.  We came to the United States less than a year back.  Our aspiration was: Across the U.S., there are lots of small hotels, which can do with better technology, better investments —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  — run by various communities across the country.  In the last eight months, every day, we’ve opened one hotel in the United States.  We now manage over 330 hotels.  We invested over $300 million in the U.S.\n\nBut over the couple of years going forward, we expect to invest another $2 billion in the United States.  We brought (inaudible) jobs.  And we’re signing a pledge with Ivanka soon that will bring hundreds of thousands of more jobs to people —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s fantastic.\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  — across Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota, and so on.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Is that where you invest?  Those areas?  That’s where you put —\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  Across this United States, but these are the states where we are the most dense.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, how many hotels do you have right now, then?\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  Three hundred and thirty in the U.S. —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s fantastic.  That’s —\n\nMR. AGARWAL:  — but worldwide, over 40,000.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That is really great.  I actually know of your company.  Not just a small company, by the way.  Good job.  Thank you very much.\n\nPlease.\n\nAIDE:  Mr. President, this is going to be the last question.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes, okay.  Well, we’ll do one and one, okay?  Go ahead.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  After aluminum, it is important to speak of steel, Mr. President.  My name is Lakshmi Mittal.  We met in Davos.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This one is a big one, right?  This is a big — this is a big guy.  This is a big player.  Go ahead.  I know him very well.  I’ve seen him on enough covers.  I should know him, huh?\n\nGo ahead.  How’s it going?\n\nMR. MITTAL:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My honor.  But since you have — you became the President, you saved the steel industry in the United States.  And Section 232 has been the big lesson for the rest of the world on how to support domestic manufacturing.  And this is what we expect the other countries to learn: that they should support domestic manufacturing, not made in China.  They support domestic manufacturing to dump steel steel in the world.  (Inaudible) over-capacitation.\n\nBut I must thank you for what you have done for the steel industry, what you have done for the tax reform, what you have done to reduce regulations.  I’ve never seen the extent of ease of doing the business what we experience in the United States anywhere else in the world.  So I must congratulate you for creating an ease of business ecosystem.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  As you know, three years ago, it was just the opposite.  It was one of the worst countries to do business in.  You couldn’t get approvals.  You couldn’t get anything done.  You were sued on environmental — you know, for environmental reasons, not because of the environment, just because it was a way of stopping a project that would produce jobs.\n\nAnd I’m a big believer in the environment and I want to take care of the environment, but they were just using the laws.  And we don’t let that happen anymore.  But if it’s something that is wrong — you know better than anybody — we stop them from doing it.  But you’ve done an incredible job.\n\nAnd the steel industry was dead in our country.  And, you know, we need — there are certain industries you can do without, to be honest with you.  There are certain industry — we can name a lot of them.  But, steel you need, from a military — and aluminum you need.  You got to have the aluminum.  But steel you need probably more than anything else.  You have to have it.\n\nAnd the job you’ve done is incredible.  Biggest in the world by far.  The job you’ve done is incredible.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  Mr. President, we are going to announce a multi-billion-dollar investment in (inaudible).\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  That’s a great place.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Well, you let me know.  I’ll be there for the groundbreaking.  No, that’s a great — I know you’re investing.  I know you’re looking at Alabama, right?\n\nMR. MITTAL:  Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I know.  I had heard that.  That’s great for a very — that’s a big plant and that’s going to be this super-efficient, super-modern.  That’s going to be a showcase, I hear.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  I know that you always know more than I do about (inaudible).  (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.  No, but people know about — people know about that.  That’s a great — that’s a great thing for Alabama and it’s an incredible place to invest.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  One last question for you.  During your last campaign, you had almost a trillion dollars of (inaudible).  Why did that (inaudible) you can give into this trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that will (inaudible)?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, we are doing things.  One of the things we’re doing, we’re going to be announcing another tax cut in not so long a period of time, largely for middle-income people, because, you know, we gave them a good tax cut but we’re going to give them a fairly substantial cut.  And that gives a lot of money to the consumer.\n\nOne of the reasons we’re doing well, and other countries are not doing well — China is having a hard time.  They’re all really — not too many are doing well.  We’re doing better than anybody in the world by far.  It’s because our consumer is rich now because of what we’ve done with a lot of things: jobs, but also tax cuts.  They have money, and other consumers don’t have money.  So that’s great.\n\nThat’s really — it’s an honor to meet you again.  And it was good seeing you there, and I look forward to seeing that plant go up.  But I think you’re going probably be doing numerous plants in the United States.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  Thank you, Mr. President.  One more comment that I have.  United Steel Workers union refused to (inaudible) Democrats.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  And after your tax reform, they started to see bigger checks.  (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  Now they want to (inaudible) Republicans.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\n\nMR. MITTAL:  People can feel the benefit of your presidency.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You gave them — you gave them the bonus?  You gave them a piece of the cut?  And the rest went into investment?\n\nMR. MITTAL:  (Laughs.)  Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it’s a great thing.  Thank you very much.  That’s beautiful.  Thank you.\n\nOkay, final question.  Go ahead.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  We’ve been in the U.S. for 35 years.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  We’ve made about 25 investments.  Our profits are in the area of $5 billion.  Last year we invested $4 billion.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  We’re in the agriculture sector.  We also do all our global biotech research in the U.S. — in agriculture biotech.  And I think the — you’re looking forward — the farmers and the agricultural sector really suffered last year.  And I think that there’s a lot of excitement around that and —\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, there is.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible) it will help us grow our business and assets.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, they were targeted as — and I’m not blaming China for that, because they want to try and win something.  And they were targeted, and I made up the difference, as you know, with the tariffs that came from China.  So they got targeted from China, and then I took money from China, I gave it to the farmers.  And frankly, they didn’t want it.  They just want a level playing field.  They’re incredible people.\n\nBut they did well, but now they’re really doing well, because you’re seeing the numbers coming out, and it’s — it’s going to be something very special.\n\nNot only that — we have $40 billion coming in from Japan.  We have a tremendous amount coming in from the new trade deal that we made with South Korea.  And then Canada and Mexico are going to be — you know, the deal is fantastic for our farmers.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is — you know, this is — that’s right.  I mean, that’s right, in the truer sense.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you have a good new head of the World Bank too.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s doing — he’s one of our people.\n\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  Well, that — that, definitely.  I thought you said the “World Bank.”  That’s right.  (Laughter.)  But that — that also.  (Laughter.)\n\nWell, listen, I want to thank you all.  Congratulations on your success.  We hope you come to the United States; invest more billions.  Because I view it not as billions, I view it as jobs.  And we have great people and we have the greatest country in the world, in my book.\n\nAnd, by the way, India — this has been an honor to be here.  And you have a very special Prime Minister.  You have somebody who is very special and he really knows what he’s doing.\n\nSomebody said, “He’s such a nice man.”  I said, “Well, actually, he’s a very tough man.”  But he is a nice man.  He can be, but he can also be as tough as they come.  You know what that means.\n\nBut he’s done a fantastic job.  But we work very closely together, and we create jobs here and he creates jobs over there through yourselves.\n\nSo again, anything we can do, let us know.  Congratulations on your success.  And I’m going to say hello to all the people now that work at the embassy, and then we’re going to have a little news conference, unless you guys don’t want to do it.  Maybe you don’t have to do it.\n\nBut we’ll have — (laughter) — you could just see them saying no.  Last time, you know, I did it where I met many, many prime ministers, presidents, all — like for three days.  I said, “Well, let’s cancel the news conference because I saw these guys every 45 minutes.”  And when I canceled the news conference, all hell broke out.  So we’re not going to do that.\n\nSo, 5 o’clock.  We’ll see you at 5 o’clock, okay?\n\nThank you, everybody.  Great honor.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n\nEND'<br />Author: 'Ilovemachines'  id: 'fa67l6'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fa67l6/trump_at_a_business_roundtable_new_delhi_very/</li>

Both my parents and my wife supported this decision wholeheartedly. But the decision turned out to be quite disastrous in retrospect as I struggled and struggled to earn, this endeavor started leeching all my savings year after year.\n\nPerhaps it was the switch in technology from .NET to open source or it was diversification into too many skills (like coding, testing, blogging, devops and copywriting), I don't know what caused this. I started spending late hours working and depression soon crept into me. When my father asked how was I doing, I kept pretending that all is well and I was making good money by freelancing. But I couldn't lie convincingly it seems based on what he said and his expressions. Yet, he kept encouraging me and supporting me, and all the while my financial and psychological well being was getting down and down.\n\nAnd now, day before yesterday on 23rd February 2020, I received the greatest shock of my life as my father (Shri Anil Yeri) passed away due to heart attack in Ahmedabad. I wasn't even near him when he died and there were so many things I wanted to say that I will never be able to say to him now, that regret is something I'll have to bear till the day I breathe my last. Today, I drowned his ashes in Narmada river and just come from there.\n\nMe and my family are devastated right now and facing literally the worst time of our lives. However, I've determined that I'll stay strong and bear this storm because I know in my heart that my dad would've wanted me to be strong. I'll continue to struggle building my career in freelancing because I know that he'd have wanted that too. This rude shock has ironically made me stronger because I know that my dad is watching me from heavens and I'm not going to let him down.\n\nMy mom has lost her only support system in life and hasn't been able to absorb this shock fully yet. Hopefully, half of my dad's retirement pension will start coming to her account as per Indian pension rules once all paperwork is complete.\n\nThanks for listening to my life story, I'd also appreciate if you can help me by ordering me a freelance gig on Fiverr or donating me via PayPal/Paytm through my [blog's Hire Me Page](https://prahladyeri.com/hire-me/)."<br />Author: 'el_programmador'  id: 'f9dlfn'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f9dlfn/a_story_a_rant_and_an_appeal/</li>

The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal.

      <li>Title::: 'How Ajmer’s Veda Pāṭhaṣāla and Sarasvatī Devasthāna was converted to Aḍhai din a Masjid'<br />Body: '\n“Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra” (literally "shed of 2½ days") is a large and imposing structure in the city of Ajmer (originally Ajaya-Meru i.e., invincible hill) in Rājasthān, Bhārat. It was originally a Sanskṛit Pāṭhaṣāla with a Devasthāna of Sarasvatī within it said to have been commissioned by Chauhān Vigraharājā III, all of which was destroyed and converted into a mosque by Islamic bigot Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak , on the orders of another zealot Muhammad Ghori , in 1192 CE. \nThe conversion to a mosque was completed in 1199 CE, and Islamic symbols were imposed on the existing structure by Iltutmish of Delhi in 1213 CE. The structure was used as a mosque up to 1947. After the independence of Bhārat, the structure was turned over to the Jaipur circle of ASI (Archaeological survey of India), which in its official publications calls it a as a fine example of a mix of Indian, Hindu, Muslim and Jain architectures !! \nIt is believed that after defeating Prithvirājā Chauhān in the Second Battle of Tarain , Muhammad Ghori passed through Ajmer. There, he saw the magnificent Devasthāna, and ordered his slave general Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak to destroy them, and construct a mosque – all within 60 hours (that is, 2 1⁄2 days) as he had to leave for further journey. The artisans could not build a complete mosque in 60 hours time, but constructed a brick screen wall where Ghori could offer prayers. By the end of the century, a complete mosque was built. \nThe inscription imposed in the Temple states the date of creation of the Mosque as April 1199CE, making it one of the oldest mosques in Bhārat. It is a telling example of the foundations on which Islam was built in Bhārat.\nThe Devasthāna/Pāṭhaṣāla contained many inscriptions, tablets with sankṛit plays, exquisite mūrtīs most of which have been either lost or disfigured, some of which are on display at the Rajputānā Museum at Ajmer. The fact that they have survived for 900 years shows the quality of work undertaken by Bhāratīyas at the time. \nNoted Scholar Śrī Prafull Goradia in his book “Hindu Masjids” has covered this usurped Hindū structure in detail, some extracts of which are given below. \nThe Jhoprā is among the first in a series of temple desecrations perpetrated by foreign rulers of Bhārat. The earlier atrocities were by Mahmud Ghazni , who raided but did not stay back to rule. The triple temples were so attractive that the desecrator chose to retain all, or most of the pillars. There are 70 of them under three roofs which meet and appear to be one integrated whole. And there are other pillars beyond the covered edifice, which looks like a pavilion in splendid stone.\nThe pillars are some 30 feet high gorgeously carved either with exquisite designs up to a height of about 26 feet, thereafter adorned with delicate figurines. Uncannily, there is not a single figure whose face has not been cut off. Nowhere in Europe does one see such acts of vandalism, except what the original barbarian vandals themselves perpetrated under their king Gaiseric, in the wake of the conquest of Rome in 455 AD. \nThe figurines on all the relics on display at the Rajputana Museum as well as those salvaged by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) duly locked in the compound of the Jhoprā have been systematically defaced. Amongst the thousands of stone heads, not a single nose or an eye is visible.\nMind you, the ASI has done nothing to excavate or salvage anything in the complex since Independence. With the passing of the Protection of National Monuments Act, 1951, all archaeological activities have been frozen. The credit for the excavations goes to Alexander Cunningham (the founder of ASI) and Dr. D R Bhandarkar (another eminent archaeologist who worked with the ASI) during the first half of the 20th. Details are available in the Rajasthan District Gazetteer, Ajmer, 1966. \nMuhammad Ghauri presumably offered prayers within the stipulated two and a half days. Subsequently the Adhai Din Ka Jhopra was completed with a well-carved facade which is best described in the words of the ASI Report for 1893: “The whole of the exterior is covered up with a network of tracery so finely and delicately wrought that it can only be compared to a fine lace. \nCunningham described the exterior of the Jhopra even more eloquently: “For gorgeous prodigality of ornament, beautiful richness of tracery, delicate sharpness of finish, laborious accuracy of workmanship, endless variety of detail, all of which are due to the Hindu masons, this building may justly vie with the noblest buildings which the world has yet produced.”\nSuch then was the vandalism with which the sultanate in Delhi began. As with the Quwwatul Islam masjid next to the Qutb Minar , which was also built by Sultan Aibak, so with Adhai Din Ka Jhopra at Ajmer. Both are indelible specimens of humiliation perpetrated by the victor upon the vanquished.\n\n\nIt is a classic hindu architecture:\n \nhttps://i.imgur.com/x2FNcOX.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/v2b8yDO.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KITZrhr.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/13iKLPn.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ii6xbCE.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tQjcumR.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IxdTCGO.png\n\n1856 Temples got demolished and converted into Muslim monuments since invasion of arabs/turks in India. [Source](https://www.hindustanbooks.com/pdfs/10120488-Hindu-TemplesWhat-Happend-to-Them-by-Sita-Ram-Goel.pdf)\n\n\nQuestion the Bhāratīyas must ask themselves – Now that we are independent, what stops us from re-building the great structures to their original glory? Why not start demanding for reconstruction/repair i.e., Punarutthāna of all structures of the Devī and Devatās we worship? Does independence mean we abandon and forsake our Temples, culture, tradition and Gods?'<br />Author: '10100011a10100011a'  id: 'f8rzz1'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f8rzz1/how_ajmers_veda_pāṭhaṣāla_and_sarasvatī/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indian nationalists cannot afford to be hostile towards Muslims. Change my mind.'<br />Body: "Unlike other major powers like USA, China or European Union for example, India has way too many Muslims and the South Asian region as a whole is populated by 30% Muslims, even more in number than the whole of Middle East and North Africa combined. Not only that, both sides of the Indian ocean are filled with Muslim-majority countries, like Indonesia, Malaysia, Somalia and Sudan. \n\nWhat this means is, Indian nationalists don't have the flexibility of a White or Chinese nationalist. A nationalist Indian government for example can never be able to implement a Muslim travel ban or set up 'education camps' to assimilate their Muslim populace. It can't even impose a burka ban. \n\nI'm not even talking about CAA here, which isn't even half as discriminatory as the examples I mentioned earlier. When I see some nationalists, especially in this Subreddit, hard-hitting Muslims for their beliefs, I just want to tell them that: **Guys, it's not our battle.** \n\nJudging by India's geographical and demographic situation, it will do more damage to India's development if 15% of people in the country and 30% in the Subcontinent become anti-Indians, because of all the messages they see coming out from the other side. And let's not forget, it's not as if India's problem would be solved if there's no Muslims in South Asia. It is USA and China that have taken turns in propping up Pakistan for over 70 years. \n\nMy suggestion, especially to frequent visitors of this Subreddit, who consider themselves to be a nationalist, **is to play by our strengths**. I'm not saying become secular or inclusive, but simple things like not becoming fixated or antagonistic towards only one group can go very far. Being friendly towards liberal-minded Muslims who prefer the Indian way of life compared that of their own could be a tremendous asset. **Most importantly, keep in mind that India's greatest enemies are not the small or disunited guys, it's always the big and powerful guys who pull the strings.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'f8ph87'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f8ph87/indian_nationalists_cannot_afford_to_be_hostile/</li>

You can watch his videos if you wish and I recommend it   \n\n[video](https://youtu.be/RNFesa01llk)\n\nbut TLDR is \n\n1) hyperloop has never been tested before and only test that was done , was in a 1km distance track without a living being sitting inside. Also not at a full scale. \n\n2) Also , hyperloop train runs in vacuum ,which means the whole track should be vacuum pumped. so , the volume of this vacuum chamber would be bigger than biggest vacuum chamber. Also the fact that temperature difference in atmosphere will cause thermal expansion and compression , making it even more difficult to maintain this vacuum.\n\n3) Also potential risk is too high. If there is ever an accident in hyperloop track , all the people in   \n whole hyperloop at that time will die because of the shock wave. \n\nI think , uddhav has unknowingly or unknowingly saved government from big embarrassment. \n\nBut its sad that this government is still trying to make hyperloop trains.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 1.15'<br />Body: "***\\*Please write answer to the questions in comments\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**पाञ्चजन्यं हृषीकेशो देवदत्तं धनञ्जय |**\n\n**पौण्ड्रं दध्मौ महाशङ्खं भीमकर्मा वृकोदरः || १५ ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Then, Lord Kṛṣṇa blew His conchshell, called Pāñcajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devdatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundram.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nLord Kṛṣṇa is referred to as Hṛṣīkeśa in this verse because He is the owner of all senses The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of Hṛṣīkeśa. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusūdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Vāsudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devakī-nandana because He accepted Devakī as His mother; His name is Yaśodā-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaśodā at Vṛndāvana; His name is Pārtha-sārathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is Hṛṣīkeśa because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra.\n\nArjuna is referred to as Dhanañjaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhīma is known as Vṛkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hiḍimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the Pāṇḍavas, beginning with the Lord's, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle-and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.\n\n**Question 1 : How lord Krishna direct the senses of a living entity ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why Arjuna is known as Dhanañjaya ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lozcrhzh2ti41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b13440dca6d4930d182e0adcf787a3b02c6c5d7\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'f8mcob'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f8mcob/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_115/</li>

Two of the terrorists called India TV during the attacks and claimed to be 'deccan mujahadeen'.\n\nWhat is the point of attacking targets that no hindu would attack, and claiming to be 'deccan mujahadeen' if you wanted to do a false flag attack and credit hindu terror?"<br />Author: 'hajisirji'  id: 'f82dxb'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f82dxb/if_the_2611_attacks_were_meant_to_show_hindu/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The typical day of an Indian Liberal'<br />Body: '6 AM-\xa0Get up to the tunes of the glorious Soviet Anthem. While getting up, I notice that my bed is wet and I blame Modi for the same. I then go to the bathroom\n6:30 AM-\xa0My day always starts with the reading of the Communist Manifesto. After that, I go and prostrate before the images of Marx, Lenin and Nehru.\n7 AM-\xa0I go down to the hall where all of our family sits down for breakfast. My father (The Hindu editor), mom (NDTV anchor), grand father (Congress politician) and my grandmom (NAC member) sit together with me. Together, we have a typical liberal’s breakfast- Chicken, Beef, Mutton. In the background lies a PETA poster.\n7:30 AM-\xa0Me and my mates from the local NGO gather at their meeting place. We all worship our true lord Jesus Christ together. Then, we practice demonizing Hindu Gods so that our secularism score increases.\n8 AM-\xa0Me and my NGO friends set out for a remote village to convert more people into Christianity. Yeah, the same rice bag converts. On the way, I see a few children happily celebrating a Hindu festival. I feel guilty over the same.\n9 AM-\xa0After fulfilling our conversion quota for the day (500), me and my NGO mates return back. I go back to my home. Then, to get rid of my guilt feelings, I go and write articles for The Wire, Buzzfeed, New York Times, The Hindu and Washington Times.\n10 AM-\xa0Go around my neighborhood and litter it. I want to keep people away from the influence of Evil Swacch Bharat campaign. I tell the people how Modi wants to make India a Hindu Rashtra by silently forcing the Hindu way of life on us.\n11 AM-\xa0Make my way to the local office of the Communist Party. Me and my comrades watch Soviet propaganda and yearn for a Communist rule in India. Later, we head out to our local neighbourhood.\n1 PM-\xa0By 1 PM, me and my comrades are done distributing pamphlets on how communism will be beneficial for society. We have successfully brainwashed 40 people today and kept them away from the evil influence of capitalism.\n2 PM-\xa0Go back to my home for lunch. For lunch, I like to have poha with illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who my other liberal buddies helped get into India. After lunch, me and the immigrants like to play a game of cards known as “Victim Card”.\n3 PM-\xa0Attend my school just for one hour. It is always the maths period this time. But since I am keen to show my intellectualism, I always end up blabbering something and making a farrago of the situation.\n4 PM-\xa0Again go back to the local Communist Party office. Me and my comrades go the rich neighborhood nearby and study about the poverty there. We then conclude that the poverty is due to rich people and they need to be taught a lesson. I tweet about how poor people (10 LPA, own Swift dzire, AC, independent house) are suffering in this rich neighborhood. My blind Twitter followers start a campaign on the same.\n5 PM-\xa0Go back to my home and write conspiracy theories on how Swacch Bharat will lead to Hindu Rashtra.\n7 PM-\xa0Go to the house of a terrorist and report on their “human” side. I openly claim that I don’t support any party, but secretly I encourage Kejriwal to contest as PM candidate in 2024.\n8 PM-\xa0Write articles on banning Holi (save water), Diwali (cracker noise), Lohri etc. But at the same time, I write articles justifying other religion’s festivals.\n9 PM-\xa0Watch Ravish Kumar’s prime time on NDTV while eating beef roast (a typical Liberal dinner).\n10 PM-\xa0Prostrate before images of Lenin, Marx and Nehru. Read the Communist Manifesto once again. Photograph myself with sickle and hammer. Blame Modi for not being able to sleep.\n10: 30 PM-\xa0After half an hour of blaming Modi, go to sleep\nSo, thus this is the daily life of a typical Indian liberal.\n\n\nTaken from a quora answer'<br />Author: 'rollexxx_'  id: 'f7rxpg'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f7rxpg/the_typical_day_of_an_indian_liberal/</li>

I loved a very unique and beautiful experience of last evening.'<br />Body: 'I haven\'t planed it to be but it was great to see myself in Bhubaneswar for Maha Shiva Ratri. Yesterday I set myself exploring the city with absolutely no plan; just wanted to get into a bus and go till where it takes. And it was fun too. So evening I found myself in some remote corner of the city where the next bus that takes me back to the city is nearly two hours away. Had some really good tea. There is a large tree under which few old men are sitting and I walked there. There is also a small shiva temple behind.\n\nWent to the temple, took blessings and was given some prashad. I was sitting and enjoying slight cool breeze and vibrant colors of the dusk sky. Unknowingly I was looking at a group of sadhus in saffron. They were smoking, passing around the chillum. Each one takes it, does a "namaskaram", says "Jai Bholenadh" and  takes a deep drag. So, one sadhu looked at me, probably with a question mark -"do you want to"?\n\nFrankly, they were very unkempt, crude looking - I mean, not very appealing (like beggars) to approach. Being a sucker for weed, I thought \'what the hell\' and went and sat beside them. One of them put his hand over my head as if blessing me and then, filled up the chillum and gave it to me. I also bowed my head low, gave a namsakaram, lit up the chillum and took one deep drag. Damn! it was an instant bomb. I don\'t think I\'ve smoked anything that good (even 5k bluebaleno that I ordered on darknet sometime ago). I was instantly euphoric. This crazy happiness took possession over me all of a sudden. I remember laughing a lot. The world instantly became better - the skies, its color, the breeze and the way it touches my skin, peoples faces, the calmness and the silence, bells ringing slowly in nearby house after evening prayers and the sound of sankh. It was like living in a beautiful and a masterpiece picture painted by some great dutch master.\n\nI don\'t know how I got back to my room, but I did. This definitely is one of the best experiences I ever had in my life. Damn! people want to go to "swarga" after death, but I\'d rather come here.\n\nSo, bhratas of the spiritual city of Bhubaneswar, first, tell me where did I go? I have no fucking clue.  \n\nIs there any place or a group/gathering that you want to me to explore. Saadhuus, sanyasis are welcome. If you can recommend, I am gonna buy two large pots of rosogullas and take along with me. Even Bhajan is also okay.\n\nAlso, I thought of visiting Chilka lake. I\'ve read that I should go to Satapada from Puri. Is that okay? How about accomodation? I tried calling Panthi Nivas but no one picks up the damn phone. And even if they do, the line is so noisy and their language is so thick with accent I can\'t make out.

No its not. Secularism is the loophole these Urban Jihadis and Urban Naxals are using to break the country apart. I guess the leaders during 1947 thought Secularism was a good idea.

Democracy has yet failed to produce one. However, wouldn\'t taking democracy be an affront to our values, or our Constitution? Would it not be a robbery of rights from the Indian people?\n\nCommunism, in various examples in history has been riddled with the same problems, corruption and inefficiency. Though it claims to be for the people, it had done little for the worker, and harmed the supplier. If Corporatism were to be instated in India, would we see a difference?\n\nWith all that the Indian people had suffered, Sikhs, Hindus and at times Muslims too, with the oppression, injustice and looting done by the Mughals and the British, we could use some pride in our culture, our times of greatness, to feel proud to be Indian, and our ancestors\' valiant and heroic action for their own nation.\n\nWith certain amount of pride, we should realise that we should take more care of our holy sites. However, how much pride is too much?\n\nLet us not forget that not all Muslims are Pakistani rapists. Some Muslims cherish the idea of being Indian, which I\'d condone, seeing as the Brits had divided us by religion, and yet these people are able to see national lines. Yet these people hold honour when they say "India is my country."\n\nYet who can be proud of that statement, when rape is rampant, corruption cripples us, and the democracy we champion indulges in inactivity.\n\nI don\'t lnow what to believe. I would like to believe that to be happy, you\'d need something to love and live by. Fascism would satisfy that with the state, but the state would mean your freedoms, at an extent. So, Reddit?

      <li>Title::: 'Opinion: CAA protests is the counter move against TT'<br />Body: 'Most of you may have already felt this:\n\n* While instant TT was an excellent political move by the BJP that divided the muslim vote bank by gender, trying to secure (in theory) 50% of the sunni (95% populace) vote bank (Most shia don\'t follow TT rules). \n* As a counter move, CAA protests and disinformation was to once again consolidate Muslim vote by the Congress+.\n\nDid it work? That is to be seen.\n\nOwn thoughts:\n\n* It is sad to see that, even after 70+ yrs of Independence, we are still country ruled by a Mughal-British policy (Mindset) while being a Hindu majority. The fact that media is able to somewhat rile up with some success this in urban settings enforces this. \n* It is good that we are realizing this, but the progress is quite slow and have greater chance to regress (One step forward, two steps back)\n* I am starting to believe that democracy is not going to get us very far, since we are overwhelmed by single issue voters. While they say dissent and opposition is the safety valve of democracy, this is only when the populace is educated enough to critically analyze and perceive. \n* The politics of nationalism works effectively when the country is imminent threat of conquest or war. As such, while we do face terrorists threats and what not, we are not in a position to be overwhelmed by another nation in the immediate future.  Peace time policies and propaganda would be what people want to hear (Like economic growth, infrastructure, etc).\n* We have an abhorrent civic sense, which is the foundation of maintaining infrastructure. The way of our democracy prevents leaders to incentive this ("You trash whatever you feel like, we\' as politicians will support you as long as u vote for us!"). On the other hand, developed nations are able to stay and continue to be developed (Clean roads, good infra, low petty corruption, etc) because there is a massive society driven civic sense. \n\nThoughts and views?'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'f4qmua'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f4qmua/opinion_caa_protests_is_the_counter_move_against/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'My relatives tried to marry me off to a man I had never met before.'<br />Body: 'I had posted this on the entitledparents sub a few days ago.  \n\n\n\nI was 22, my extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins etc began asking me why I wasn\'t married yet. I spent my childhood and early 20s in a fairly conservative North Indian state. And people in those areas tend to be deeply misogynistic and the only way a woman has any value in their eyes is if she\'s attached to a man. Her own accomplishments, talents etc are of no consequence. So it wasn\'t all that surprising when I began getting these ridiculous questions about marriage while I was still in college.\n\n\u200b\n\nI had recently lost a lot of weight and for the first time I actually looked good in jeans. My weight loss seemed to cause their queries to reach whole new levels of idiocy. You see, they all assumed that the only reason I had lost weight was so I could land a husband. Surely I hadn\'t done it for the sake of my own health and well being, or because I wanted to look good for myself. That would be preposterous!\n\nMy aunt (about whom you can read in some of my other posts to know what vile human being she was) was friends with a "matchmaker". Matchmakers in India are are these cunty middle aged women who have nothing better to do than to go around carrying photographs and info about "eligible" bachelors and bachelorettes and share them with the families of young men and women who are looking to marry them off. My aunt\'s friend was no different. She showed my aunt a picture some guy in his late 20s who also "had a great job and was from a respectable family" Let\'s call this guy Ajay. My aunt shared the picture and the info with my grandmother (go read these posts to know exactly what kind of a person my grandmother was - My grandmother stole my clothes and My grandmother made sure I stayed fat.) Between the two of them, they decided that Ajay, whom I had never met before, would be the perfect match for me. Keep in mind that neither I nor my dad had any inkling of what was going on.\n\n\u200b\n\nOne afternoon, I think it was Sunday, my aunt came over when I wasn\'t home. She told my dad to "get his daughter dressed up and pretty" because she had promised me to a guy and his parents were coming over to see me that very evening. The tone in which she spoke made it sound like she had done me and my dad a big favor. My dad was shocked and asked what the hell she was talking about. She told him she had taken it upon herself to find a groom for me (without my knowledge or consent) and "taken some of the burden off his shoulders" and that their mother (my grandmother) had approved of the match. My dad told her he would have to speak to me first and whether the guy\'s parents can come over or not depends on what I have to day about this. The little cunt actually tried to convince my dad that my consent wasn\'t necessary and that as elders they had every right to make this decision for me. But my dad wasn\'t having it.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen I came home a few hours later, my aunt greeted me with a hug. This was enough to sent red flags flying everywhere. I asked her what was going on and she gleefully told me that she had done and how her proposition had my grandmother\'s blessings. I told her to shove it up her ass and that I was in no mood to have an arranged marriage - not then, not ever. She looked shocked and asked how I could say such a thing after all the trouble she\'s been through in order to find "such a wonderful young man" for me. I decided to get dirty. I told her if the "wonderful young man" is making her so wet, why doesn\'t she go marry him? My dad heard this and told me to watch my language. I told him I would if this bitch knew her place and knew not to poke her nose where it doesn\'t belong.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nMy grandmother had heard the commotion from her room and called out to my dad. She began telling him about ho she had seen the guy\'s picture and the matchmaker had told them all about his family. And how a match like this may not come along again. My dad told her that he would never force his daughter to marry if she doesn\'t want to. My step mom said the same. I merely told her she was insane and belongs in a lunatic asylum.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis of course, caused both grandmonster and crazy aunt to fake cry and go on and on about how my dad doesn\'t trust them to make the right decision for his daughter, and that they were family and family has the right to make decisions for each other (WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, BITCH!!!). I wasn\'t going to budge however and told them I wasn\'t going to meet the guy or his parents and aunt better cancel the meeting if she knows what\'s good for her. Aunt left our house grumbling.\n\n\u200b\n\nBut the drama was far from over. My grandmonster, in order to emotionally blackmail my dad into agreeing to the match, with or without my consent, she stopped eating. Anytime food was brought to her, she would break into crocodile tears and whine about how my dad was dishonouring her wishes. As she was diabetic, her health began to deteriorate. My dad was scared. One evening, he and my step mom sat me down and asked if I would consider the proposal and just have a meeting with Ajay\'s family. I was still adamant and said no.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy aunt came over again and said she had great news, as Ajay\'s parents were still interested in meting me and they would allow me to study and have a career after I married their son. I asked her what part of the word "NO" did she not understand the last time we spoke and who the fuck do Ajay\'s parents think they are to "allow" me to do anything. Aunt once again flew into an impotent rage and asked how I could be so selfish. How I could disobey my family like this and some other bullshit about how marriage is a union between families and not just individuals and how in her days girls were married off as soon as they reached adulthood whether they liked it or not. I let her go on for some time as her little hissy fit was quite amusing to me.\n\n\u200b\n\nAfter she and exhausted herself, I told her that if she, grandmonster or even my parents even try to force me into this marriage, I was going to cut my wrist. And if I survived, the cops would know that I did it because I was being forced to marry against my will and all involved would be in a world of trouble. Even if I died, I would leave behind enough evidence in the form of emails to all my friends and collage professors detailing how i was being mentally tortured so I could be forced into this marriage. Both outcomes would result in all of them in deep legal shit. I even showed them the email I had already written, all I had to do was send it. And if any of them even think of locking me up and taking away my phone, laptop etc, they should remember that my vocal cords still work and I would gather the entire neighborhood with my screams and cops would surely be called.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs I spoke, my aunt\'s eyes kept getting wider and wider. She was in shock, but she knew me well enough to know that I was very capable of doing all of this. She left quietly. Grandmonster must have heard every word, because her hunger strike came to an end. My aunt never tried to look for a match for me again.\n\n\u200b\n\nLater, my dad told me that he was only asking me to think about the match and that he would never force me to do something I didn\'t want to do. I told him I knew that and assured him that my threats were only meant to scare my aunt. And they worked.'<br />Author: 'shygirlturnedsassy'  id: 'f4o8q0'<br />Score:120<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f4o8q0/my_relatives_tried_to_marry_me_off_to_a_man_i_had/</li>

Great men such as Swami Vivekanand, Subhas Chandra Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Shyam Prasad Mukherjee. Revolutionaries not limited to Surya Sen, Sachindranath Sanyal, Prafulla Chaki and many more come from this land. There was a saying which may still hold true - What happens in Bengal will happen to India 10 years later. The Bengalis who before the Divide and Conquer overlords had their way were deeply rooted to the Indic cultural ethos even if they practiced a different faith - Probably the reason why Pakistan military purged up to 3 million bc they didn’t like how they were co-religionists and more Bengali than Islamists - A genocide which never gets spoken of, has not gotten recognized by majority of the countries in the world.\n\nBengal has lost her way - a massive decline with the advent of communism for more than 3 decades. The messiah who was supposed to show a new way after overcoming the unthinkable - defeating the left. Merely took the same methods and made it worse. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nThe land which is bearing the brunt of illegal migrants (after Assam) and facing tremendous inorganic demographic change while jihadi sympathizers get a free run. The land of the Shakti Movement, the land of Ma Kali.\n\nWhere is the home grown Bengali Hindutva movement? All due to respect to the BJP, everybody knows they have not groomed any local leaders for what’s coming. Why the fuck should even BJP take the monopoly of Hindutva? It’s a fair question. There can be other Hindutva parties who can be better and ensure that the BJP isn’t caught napping and are always on their top game.\n\nMaharashtra had it until Shiv Sena lost their balls somewhere after Bal Thackeray left the public sphere. Not that I agree with SS but I understand they are needed as a counter force. I am scratching my head on why hasn’t there been a Bengali Hindutva movement yet. 4 decades of barrenness.\n\nWhat Bengal desperately needs is a homegrown party led by a 21st century Netaji.

Now imagine if coronavirus had appeared in US and Europe we would be showering empathy towards them through /#PrayforEurope  /#HelpAmerica and bullshit like that.
