      <li>Title::: "Regarding Ukranian army's prosecution of Indian students, I want you to know something."<br />Body: "Guys, in the light of recent events of Ukrainian soldiers beating, discriminating and keeping Indian students hostage, I would like to make everyone aware of the provisions of international humanitarian law contained in Geneva Conventions. We must stand and act together.\n\nSource: https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docindex/v1_rul_rule96\n\nAn excerpt:\n\nRule 96. The taking of hostages is prohibited.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 32, Section I.\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\nInternational and non-international armed conflicts\n\nCommon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the taking of hostages.[1]\xa0It is also prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention and is considered a grave breach thereof.[2]\xa0These provisions were to some extent a departure from international law as it stood at that time, articulated in the\xa0List (Hostages Trial) case\xa0in 1948,\xa0in which the US Military Tribunal at Nuremberg did not rule out the possibility of an occupying power taking hostages as a measure of last resort and under certain strict conditions.[3]\xa0However, in addition to the provisions in the Geneva Conventions, practice since then shows that the prohibition of hostage-taking is now firmly entrenched in customary international law and is considered a war crime.\n\nThe prohibition of hostage-taking is recognised as a fundamental guarantee for civilians and persons\xa0hors de combat\xa0in Additional Protocols I and II.[4]\xa0Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the “taking of hostages” constitutes a war crime in both international and non-international armed conflicts.[5]\xa0Hostage-taking is also listed as a war crime under the Statutes of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and of the Special Court for Sierra Leone.[6]\xa0Numerous military manuals prohibit the taking of hostages.[7]\xa0This prohibition is also set forth in the legislation of numerous States.[8]\n\nIt gets even more interesting in the definition section. Spread the word, what Ukrainian army is doing doesn't reflect humanitarianism rather symptomatic of the hardline stance of Ukrainian representative at UN."<br />Author: 'dickforchick'  id: 't2rwcm'<br />Score:173<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t2rwcm/regarding_ukranian_armys_prosecution_of_indian/</li>

[This is what I think the map of the war would look like](https://imgur.com/a/mN2HMgz) though I could be wrong here. But this is simply a nightmarish scenario for us.\n\nIndia can't handle a prolonged war with China alone, we can handle a short quick war but we can't handle a long with China, and in this situation we might have to face a two front assault from both Pakistan and China and even maybe Russia.\n\nIf we couldn't handle it, the Punjab and the Doab region may get overrun by foreign troops and we might have to retreat into the deccan to continue resistance or surrender.\n\nIndia needs to buy as many weapons we can, we need to standardize our weaponry and make them compatible with each other, we need to set up a huge military industrial complex to support a prolonged war if it comes to that.

      <li>Title::: 'The End Game'<br />Body: 'I had a moment of epiphany.\n\n"If you want to understand a man, you need to know what he wants" \n\nRussia - Ukraine, NATO - Russia, Russia - USA\nWe can debate why this exists till the end of times. \n\nBut. Why did all this start to begin with? Again we can debate this till the end of times but there is a variable in this equation which doesn\'t belong here.\n\nUS of the A.\n\nIts a nation across altantic. It doesn\'t share borders with any nation in this equation. Infact it doesn\'t even have any boots on the ground in this current war.\n\nAlthough when you think about it, the timing is conspicuous. The war ends in Afghanistan, another one begins. And the benign President of America, while carefully trying to avoid world war 3 sends the "crucial" help to the David in this battle against Goliath. Ofcourse, paid by in taxes of American people to the ever ready military industrial complex. Great story to tell. Easily digestible, hard to question.\n\nAfter all, somebody has to fight somebody to buy somebody\'s weapons right? So it\'s all about selling weapons? Is it?\n\nSelling weapons worth few billions isn\'t worth having a war. The catastrophic human suffering is worth more than that. So, what worth does it have?\n\nLets try to look for the answer in a minute.\n\nLets start with Ukraine. What does USA have to do with starting this war against Ukraine and Russia? We have already established selling weapons can\'t be worth it, its not like Ukraine is paying for it, its being paid by Americans.\n\n\nBut we do have a war going on. And it\'s the Russians who started it. Putins finally going cuckoo and is one step away from the toothbrush moustache. He wants to raise new USSR. He won\'t stop at Ukraine, little Polska is next, the natural next step according to the dictator playbook, isn\'t it?\n\nMaybe Putin is mad or he isn\'t, maybe he wants new USSR or he doesn\'t, maybe he only wants Ukraine from getting into NATO and is deathly scared of having NATO boots at his doorstep. There frankly isn\'t any point reaching a conclusion here. \n\nThe NATO has been romanticizing Ukraine with a membership while Putin has conveyed his reservations about the idea. Very strongly. He cut off a part of the country. That\'s a strong conveying of a message. Maybe it wasn\'t a message. Maybe it\'s his policy to occupy entire Ukraine with such salami slicing, for whatever reasons you can muster up. Natural gas, petroleum, fresh water supply whatever.\n\nInfact it was Zelensky giving ultimatum to Putin to end war in eastern Ukraine\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-gives-putin-one-year-strike-deal-end-war\n\nYet Ukraine kept pushing for NATO membership. And NATO, without giving any assurance of any military support kept entertaining that idea. It becomes especially dangerous when you understand the chronology. \n\n"On February 12, 2008, (then) Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia may target its missiles at Ukraine if its neighbour joins NATO and accepts the deployment of a US missile defence shield."\n\n"Prime Minister Vladimir Putin reportedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO his country could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea."\n\n"In an interview with the BBC on 18 November 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin spokesmen Dmitry Peskov called for "a 100% guarantee that no-one would think about Ukraine joining NATO"; 2 days later Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg rejected this call stating it would be "violating the idea of respecting the sovereignty of Ukraine, which is a fundamental"\n\n"On 30 November 2021, Russian President Putin stated that an expansion of NATO\'s presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Russian cities or missile defense systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a "red line" issue for Russia"\n\n"In this regard, on January 10, 2022, US and Russian diplomats held security talks in Geneva to discuss the military activities of both countries and growing tensions around Ukraine. The head of the Russian delegation at a meeting in Geneva between the United States and Russia said that Russia needed "concrete guarantees" that Ukraine and Georgia would never become members of NATO, enshrined in the decision of the Madrid Summit of 2022. Earlier, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov also said that "the risks of military confrontation should not be underestimated" and that the American side, refusing to not expand NATO, underestimates the seriousness of the situation."\n\nBut alas minister, the American side didn\'t underestimate. Infact they were counting on the seriousness of it. Just weren\'t keen on letting you know. \n\nHere are two lectures about it, if you are keen.\nhttps://youtu.be/ESwIVY2oimI \nhttps://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4\n\nFor a country threatened by war, to keep dangling the very reason of the threat in front of it while providing no assurances of any protection in case of war, is a very dangerous policy. The culmination of which we saw on 25th Feb. \n\nRussia did what it had always threatened to do. Problem with that is, you are predictable. If you are predictable, you are going to loose. And Russia is going to loose. The moment it invaded Ukraine, USA had won without firing a single bullet. Its just a matter of time Russia loses its superpower status, a superpower without money is no superpower. \n\nAnd that\'s how with its endless pursuit of unipolar liberal hegemony, USA got rid of 2nd most powerful military in the world. \n\nWhat happens to Ukraine here on, doesn\'t matter. The contestants shall always be Russia and NATO. Not USA. Your benign liberal hegemon.\n\nThe game moves to Asia from here on. The next two military powers in the world reside in Asia. And whats more, they are next to each other. The cherry on the top, they already have disputes for territory. \n\nDirect confrontation of two major powers divides the world in sects. China vs USA. Its easier to point fingers, harder to pull out of the conflict. But let\'s say if 4 powers are involved, with similar interests against a regional communist hegemon, boy ain\'t that convinient.\n\nAsias Ukraine is Taiwan. Or is it South China Sea? Or Arunachal Pradesh? So many options to choose from.\n\nQUAD is not NATO. QUAD is all the risk of NATO and none of the protection. \n\nWouldn\'t it be wonderful if the next two powers which can surpass you in near future, have a dispute, fight a war with each other and put themselves out of the equation.\n\nWhat remains is a unipolar world with a liberal hegemon as the sole policeman of the world, free to do whatever it wants. \n\nAnd that is the end game. And thats the cost of human suffering.'<br />Author: 'Sakthlavda'  id: 't2m9lz'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t2m9lz/the_end_game/</li>

When I read a detailed article explaining the NSE scandal (credits to The Hindu) there was a brief mention of NSEL. I linked it up with what I briefly read in the book which linked former Finance minister of UPA and the present NSE chairman as being responsible or colluded with the corrupt brokers. It also states that the whole scam was a farce and was a well planned sabotage to help the maintain the monopoly of the share market. \n\n\nWith more details possibly revealed in the upcoming days I\'m expecting more dirt to be unearthed on how the NSE was responsible for NSEL\'s downfall.

      <li>Title::: 'The problem with Islam: the distinction between a good Muslim &amp; bad Muslim and the future of Islam in a secular country.'<br />Body: 'We, Hindus, are almost always accused of Islamophobia. I argument we often face is that ‘not all Muslims are bad’. I gave this a great amount of thought: Are all Muslims bad or how do you differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim?\n\nThe answer I’ve reached it pretty elementary. One, unlike Hindutv, Islam is not a buffet-type religion. Which means that either you follow Islam or you don’t follow Islam. You’re either in Dar al-Harb or Dar al-Islam. You can’t be a Muslim and deny parts of the Quran.\n\n“*O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.*”\n\n**To be called a Muslim, one must believe in no other God but Allah and follow his word (the Quran).**\n\nYou can call yourselves a Muslim all you want but unless you do the above, you’re not a Muslim. The moment a person says that it’s valid to criticize the Quran, the word of Allah, is the moment one ceases to be a Muslim.\n\nThere should be no disagreement on the fact that anyone who follows the Quran unquestionably is not fit to live in a civilized and pluralistic society because Quran preaches many such things which are illegal in a secular society.\n\nThe very concept of  labeling polytheists as ‘*Kafirs*’ or ‘*Mushirks*’ is offensive and discriminatory. The concept of having polytheists pay ‘*Jaziya*’ if they don’t convert to Islam is atrocious. In other words, you can’t have it both ways by saying that you believe in women empowerment &amp; universal brotherhood and call yourselves a Muslim.\n\nSura 2:4 - “*And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter*”.\n\nSura 2:5 - “*These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful*”.\n\nSura 2:6 - “*As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not*”.\n\nSura 2:7 - “*Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom*”.\n\nSura 2:8 - “*And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when they believe not*”.\n\nSura 2:9 - “*They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not*”.\n\nSura 2:10 - “*In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie*”.\n\nSura 2:11 - “*And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We are peacemakers only*”.\n\nSura 2:12 - “*Are not they indeed the mischief-makers ? But they perceive not*”.\n\nSura 2:13 - “*And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall we believe as the foolish believe ? are not they indeed the foolish ? But they know not.*”\n\nSura 2:14 - “*And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock”*.\n\nSura 2:15 - “*Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy*”.\n\nSura 3:85 - “*Should anyone follow a religion other than Islam, it shall never be accepted from him, and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter. As for those who reject Islam (kafārū), I will punish them with a severe punishment in the world and the Hereafter; and they will have no helpers.*”\n\nNow, I admit that every religion, Abrahamic religions in particular, has issues which need to be addressed and the religion needs to evolve via reforms. A good religion evolves with time. However, the concept of reform in Islam is unheard of because of an important reason. The Quran says the below.\n\n“*Today those who disbelieve have lost all hope of (damaging) your faith. So, do not fear them, and fear Me. Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed My blessing upon you, and chosen Islam as Dīn (religion and a way of life) for you.*”\n\nThere can be no reform if you consider your religion as perfect.\n\nCredit where credit is due.\n\nThe Quran does say in Sura 29:46 - “*And do not dispute with the followers of the book…except those of them who act unjustly, and say: We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you, and our God and your God is One, and to Him do we submit.*”\n\nHere ‘*followers of the book*’ refer to other two Abrahamic religions: Christianity and Judaism. However, no where does the Quran say the same for polytheists or idol worshipers such as Pagans and Hindus.\n\nFor them, the Quran says,\n\nSura 9:3 - “*This is a public proclamation by Allah and His Messenger to all people on the day of the Great Pilgrimage: “Allah is free from all obligation to those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity; and so is His Messenger. If you repent, it shall be for your own good; but if you turn away, then know well that you will not be able to frustrate Allah. So give glad tidings of a painful chastisement to those who disbelieve.*”\n\nSura 9:4 - “*Except those of the Polytheists with whom you have a treaty, and they were not deficient (in fulfilling the treaty) with you, and did not back up any one against you. So fulfill the treaty with them up to their term. Surely, Allah loves the God-fearing*”.\n\nSura 9:5 - “*So, when the sacred months expire, kill the Polytheists wherever you find them, and catch them and besiege them and sit in ambush for them everywhere. Then, if they repent and establish Salāh and pay Zakāh, leave their way. Surely, Allah is most Forgiving, Very-Merciful*”.\n\nMany Muslims I’ve debated with, say that the above verse is said in context of self-defense or in battle because the polytheists were hostile towards the Muslims. However, ‘*kill the Mushriks wherever you find them*’ and ‘*sit in ambush for them everywhere*’ doesn’t sound like actions taken in self-defense.\n\nMoreover, it says to leave their way only if they repent and convert to Islam. It doesn’t say outright to convert to Islam but demanding the practice of *Salāh* and *Zakāh*, which are two of the pillars of Islams implies religious conversion as Muslims practice *Salāh* and *Zakāh* themselves.\n\nSura 9:6 - “*And if any one of the Polytheists seeks your protection, give him protection until he listens to the Word of Allah, then let him reach his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know*”.\n\nThe phrase ‘*give him protection until he listens to the Word of Allah*’ is another implication at converting to Islam.\n\nThe so-called good Muslims are no longer Muslims according to the Quran as they are not obeying the word of Allah. These good Muslims will be executed under Shariat for Blasphemy. My question is why call yourselves a Muslim at all, when you’re not.\n\nIf I roam in Germany with a Hakenkreuz painted on my forehead, I’ll be arrested even though I don’t approve of the Nazi ideology. Why affiliate with an ideology that you’ve rejected! Why take blame for a crime you never committed! When someone says that he is a Muslim, I hear that he unquestionably follows the Quran and sees me as a Kaafir.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, the only good Muslims are ex-Muslims.\n\nThe paradox of tolerance given by Karl Popper states, “*If a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must retain the right to be intolerant of intolerance*”.\n\nThis explains why secular countries shouldn’t give Islam the same level of priority as other religions because Islam, at its core, is an intolerant ideology. Giving Islam the same level of priority in a secular country will eventually turn that secular country into an Islamic theocracy.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, criticism and opinions. Thank you.'<br />Author: 'traphtrahul'  id: 't2aykk'<br />Score:329<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t2aykk/the_problem_with_islam_the_distinction_between_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is the best natural treatment for hair loss? (Answered)'<br />Body: ' Hi all, Today I will share with you some of the best natural and effective things that you can for hair loss. I did face a lot of hair loss and I did manage to reverse my condition to a large extent.\n\nNow let me first tell a bit about the FDA approved medicines for hair loss which are minoxidil and finasteride. These medicines do work but comes with a number of side effects for many people, so I generally advise people to stay clear of these medicines and only use them as a last resort option.\n\nTo better understand the best treatment for hair loss one must first understand the common reasons behind it which are genetic, nutritional, stress, medication or excessive styling related in most cases. Genetic and hereditary hair loss may be difficult to treat but other types of hair loss can easily be taken care of by paying attention to diet, reducing stress and applying less problem causing agents to the scalp.\n\nNow let me tell you the natural things that I used to regrow my hair after doing all the things that I mentioned above.\n\nPumpkin seed oil - This is the first product natural product I would recommend to any male or female who is suffereing from hair loss. Pumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols which could block enzymes and hormones in your scalp that cause hair loss. There are studies that taking pumpkin seed oil as an oral supplement caused 40 more hair growth in people than the placebo group. But i still decided to use it in topical form since I also read a mice study which says that it works well in topical form too. Take 5–6 drop and mix it with the other oil that I will mention and massage it at night.\n\nPeppermint oil - This is an absolute favourite product of mine and I would like to say use it with caution and always dilute it before using as it is very powerful. I started using this product based on a rat study in which rats were divided into 4 gropus and one group were applied saline water, one group was applied jojoba oil, one was applied minoxidil ans the last were applied peppermint oil. All the rats were examined after 4 weeks and in this study it was noted that peppermint oil group rats showed comparable or even better results than the minoxidil group rats. Now many people may not like the fragrance of pumpkin seed oil and by mixing it with peppermint there is only the fragrance of menthol that remains and it cools the head like no other.\n\nGood DHT controlling shampoo - There are many good DHT controlling shampoos in the market. I would suggest you to look for ingredients like saw palmetto, nettle leaf extract as they are natural DHT blockers.\n\nMoringa - Moringa is a nutritional powerhouse which has a ton of health benefits including protecting and nourishing skin and hair. It is said to contain a whooping 92 nutrients and 46 antioxidants which beside being good for hair also contributes towards heart health, bone health, high blood pressure, stomach problems etc. But people with low blood pressure should avoid this as this has the potential to lower the bp further. You can buy himalaya shigru tablets they contain moringa or use organic india moringa leaf powder or any other which you may find helpful.\n\nI hope it helps someone.'<br />Author: 'Devanand100'  id: 't1ysu7'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t1ysu7/what_is_the_best_natural_treatment_for_hair_loss/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'An Open Letter to this Subreddit with Regards to Ukraine'<br />Body: 'I can\'t believe this shit. I very well understand the nuances of Indian foreign policy and geopolitics and know that India should remain neutral and not say a thing when it comes to the war, but the kind of absolute bullshit some members are posting on this sub is intolerable.\n\nBefore you call me names, I am very much an Indian living in India. I am more or less a right-leaning centrist. I don\'t support the BJP but I do plan on voting for them again so far and am more or less are reasonably happy with them in most areas.\n\nI don\'t expect or want the Indian government to intervene and condemn Russia because it only hurts us, but that does not mean that I, as a citizen will agree with or support Putin or the actions of Russia. But this sub has been doing precisely that. Some members of this subreddit are making memes about how Putin is a savage and what not and promoting Russian narratives of NATO started the war.\n\nThis is absolute fucking bullshit. I have been tracking some of the war, and some images are simply heart-breaking and terrifying. I have nothing but respect for the Ukrainians who are standing up to Russians who have invaded their country. Ukraine is a sovereign nation, and Russia had no right to invade regardless of who Ukraine is shifting towards. Ukrainians are standing up and sacrificing themselves to try to stop a foreign invader from taking their land. It is the ultimate act of patriotism, and as self proclaimed patriots, you and I should have nothing but the utmost respect for this brave people.\n\nRussia was the aggregator, Russia invaded first just like they did in 2014 and with the cyberattacks in 2017. I have listened to Ukrainians talk about their country with pure passion and patriotism, many are not fleeing despite knowing that Russia is a very powerful adversary. They are standing their ground, picking up arms and defending their country. While some fucks are making memes that show Putin as some kind of savage "sigma male". My message to them is shut the fuck up and learn something from the Ukrainians.\n\nFor example the story of the 13 Ukrainians who were facing a Russian battleship offering them a chance to surrender. Instead of doing that they held their ground and responded with a brave "Go fuck yourself", they were all killed. [Audio recording of the incident](https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1497052056376553479)\n\nOr the story of the brave Ukrainian soldier that was tasked with blowing up a bridge Russian tanks were about to pass through. He had finished setting up the mines but the Russians were already close, he did not have enough time to finish the remote system and activated it manually, sacrificing his life.\n\nRussia is the aggressor. nobody can say otherwise. There is no justification whatsoever for the Russian invasion. It is irrational, and any attempt to say otherwise is plain stupid. We as Indians however should acknowledge the reality, that the government has no option but to stay quiet on the issue. This does not mean we support Russians, but we simply shut up and sit down, because we have no other course of action. This is a fact. But just because our government does this (and I fully support that), it doesn\'t mean that we need to support Putin or Russia.\n\nWe should very well give our thoughts and prayers to the Ukrainians whose lives are being ruined, whose houses are collapsing and who are dying in brutal ways. Please.'<br />Author: 'sadhgurukilledmywife'  id: 't1xn4z'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t1xn4z/an_open_letter_to_this_subreddit_with_regards_to/</li>

Also seeking like minded friends. Please read.'<br />Body: "Far away from all the noise the so-called torchbearers of those who venture into or have a thing for same sex, I find those people as unwanted noise.\n\nI never understood and its beyond me about why should there be cults made out of sexuality? Its very absurd. Very alien concept to many diverse cultures around the world, and especially India. \n\nWhat further makes zero sense to me is to club the so called gender issues with seuxality issues. Moreover, them being politically pliable voices, often found supporting hypocritical causes.\n\nI think San Fransisco kind of ideals cannot be superimposed or blanket imposed upon everywhere in the world.\n\nI do have a thing for guys being a guy. Though I have had a fair share of my 'good time' an afterthought of me indulging in it makes me feel weird and a bit disgusted. Not because I am against it or being in a denial. I am really not. \n\nI am of a framework of outlook into the world such that, Human life is precious and holy, and divine. It just shouldn't be about sex all the time, like these who make cults out of sexuality always flaunt. Heck, they have made a template (read-dictate) of how those who supposedly fall under the so-called spectrum should behave and conduct their lives. This is horrible!\n\nI was enraged when some actor just to promote a movie was waving the rainbow flag along with Indian flag. Why? Why make a majority-minority issue out of sexuality? It doesn't need to be so. Why make it seem like the so-called lgbt++++ are some sort of a micro nation fighting against the majority? This is very absurd.\n\nThus, despite me being into guys, I would never support the tamasha on roads which these false flag bearers on roads doing weird stuff do once a year. \n\nI really don't find anything in it to take 'pride' in. I am a 25yo Human Male, and I am like any other normal Human India Male getting about his life &amp; just chillin.\n\nMy parents have worked hard to give me best of whatever I ever wanted. I would never want to hurt them and my family and give them a mental ride of some things which is beyond them. \n\nSometimes, you have to choose between being happy &amp; content vs revealing all of you. I think the concept of coming out is alien to India too and I never will.\n\nAbout me? I hold Mahabharata &amp; Bhagavatam very dear to me. Infact I own complete volumes of those. I think this says it all as an ice breaker.\n\nLooking for like minded people who share similar views.

      <li>Title::: 'New world order.'<br />Body: "Looking at how Indians are either supporting Russia or undecided over Ukraine I wanted to share my thoughts, most of these are not original ideas but what's been floating around on various subs for sometime now. Personally I still feel India remaining neutral is not going to help us in the long run. \n\n\nThe entire international relationship is being manipulated by China in the last few years, China wants a bipolar world with US and itself at the helm on opposite sides, their idea of the new world order is China, Russia,Brazil, Pak, NK, Iran(the west is trying really hard to bring Iran back on international stage to avoid this) and some of the African countries on their their side and US, Europe, India and others on the other side. To this end it is very important for them to break Russia, India relationship.\n\n\nWhy does China want this? For the last few years we were virtually in a unipolar world with US on the helm, a waning Russia was nominally on the other side, now that China has overtaken Russia in all aspects it wants to position itself as the world superpower on the opposite side of US, US will eventually bow out leaving China as the only superpower, the position that US was a few years ago.\n\n\nIndia should choose carefully, we should not abandon Russia but should also be careful of a Russia under Chinese influence who will be forced to play second fiddle to China, this is not the same Russia (that was USSR and besides the point) that came to our aid against the US. We should not be stuck in past and choose our allies for our future. \n\n\nIndia is trying it's best to avoid a bipolar world as it is very much against our interest, we being forced to be a part of any coalition led by a waning western sphere is not in our best interests and there is absolutely no way we will be in a coalition led by China. So our aim should be a multi polar world or atleast a world where there are no absolute super power. To this end we need Russia to be on our side.\n\n\nRussia is being massively screwed over by China right now, China initially supported Russia atleast diplomatically in this war, they want Russia to fail now, Russia failing to decisively win against Ukraine will force it further under Chinese control, Russia should not have started this war. China is now asking Russia to come out of cold war mentality, while initially they seemed to be onboard with Russia. A Russia not allowed to trade with the world will end up becoming a weaker partner of China.\n\n\nOur best hope is in a raising Africa, yes, Africa is slowly gaining lot of prominence and they are very suspicious about China, though they have massive loans taken from China in the past. Their recent development and also some of the mature way they are handling their conflicts and also the fact that they have the youngest population in the world is showing us that they have a good chance of coming on top in next few decades, this is also a place where we should be looking for friends.\n\n\nOur other friends are the Buddhist SE countries Bhutan, \xa0Myanmar,\xa0Cambodia,\xa0Laos,\xa0Singapore,\xa0Thailand \xa0and\xa0Vietnam\xa0also South Korea. I mean its obvious we are the birth place of buddhism and we are not capitalising on this fact.\n\n\nAnd don't let our neighbours fall into Chinese trap, Nepal, Bangladesh, srilanka, Butan and Burma stop treating them like our little brothers and respect them like equals.\n\nUkraine war is the biggest propaganda at the moment, let's not get carried away.

      <li>Title::: 'Remembering 1971 when the US threatened India with its 7th Fleet to save Pakistan.'<br />Body: '**Never forget that without this incident Pakistan would not be the threat that it is today. The US saved it.** \n\n\n&gt;Nixon ordered the US Seventh Fleet’s Task Force 74, led by the nuclear powered aircraft carrier Enterprise, to proceed towards the Bay of Bengal. \n\n&gt;Nixon’s rash move – which became America’s greatest PR disaster in India – was dictated by the condition of the Pakistani military, which was taking a hammering in East Pakistan.\n\n&gt;The situation in the sub-continent took a grievous turn after Pakistan launched preemptive air strikes in North India on 3 December, 1971 dragging India into a full scale direct war with its neighbour\n\n&gt;a CIA mole in Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s cabinet had leaked her plan to bomb Pakistani military capability into the Stone Age. \n\n&gt;A livid Nixon stressed he would not allow India to break up Pakistan’s core territories in the west. He warned the Indian ambassador L.K. Jha in Washington: “If the Indians continue their military operations (against West Pakistan), we must inevitably look toward a confrontation between the USSR and the US. The Soviet Union has a treaty with India; we have one with Pakistan.”\n\n&gt;“A broad plan of action emerged which included cutting off economic aid to India, and transfer of military equipment from other US regional allies to West Pakistan."\n\n&gt;“Kissinger knew the Pakistani military had collapsed in the East and the same was anticipated within two weeks in the West."\n\n...\n\n&gt;Nixon also asked Beijing to mobilise troops on the Indian border.\n\n&gt; Moscow had moved its crack army divisions to the Chinese border, Beijing decided it was not going to sacrifice itself at Nixon\'s bidding. \n\n... \n\n&gt;At a meeting chaired by Mrs. Gandhi to assess the implications of the Seventh Fleet’s presence in the Bay of Bengal, her adviser D.P. Dhar urged India to leverage the special understanding that had been formalised in August, “What is the point of India having signed the Indo-Soviet treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, if India cannot call this bluff?” Then, on December 14, Mrs. Gandhi’s confidant P.N. Haksar cabled Dhar in Moscow saying it was necessary “to make a public announcement carrying the seal of the highest authorities in the Soviet Union that involvement or interference by third countries... cannot but aggravate the situation”. Shortly thereafter, the Soviets “sent a top-secret message to Nixon” warning the U.S. “against involvement or interference”.\n\n&gt;Soviet Navy did not take time to respond as it quickly dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok in between on 6 and 13 December of 1971. The Soviet Navy had kept a close watch on the US Seventh Fleet. \n\n&gt;The U.S. was aware that the Soviet Navy had entered the Indian Ocean on December 5 and by December 7 was “approximately 500 nautical miles east of Ceylon (Sri Lanka).” On December 8, U.S. National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger admitted that given the Russia factor, “I must warn you, Mr. President, if our bluff is called, we’ll be in trouble... we’ll lose.” On December 11, Kissinger briefed President Richard Nixon, “16 Soviet naval units are now in the Indian Ocean area, including three space support ships. Communications intelligence indicates that most of the ships are near Ceylon and Socotra.” The vessels were armed with anti-ship cruise missiles capable of destroying U.S. warships and escorted by nuclear submarines. There was no longer any ambiguity about what the Indo-Soviet Treaty meant in the unfolding situation.\n\n&gt;The White House had also been hoping for some sort of a Chinese move to complicate India’s military operations. On the same day, Nixon told Kissinger, “a movement of even some Chinese toward that border could scare those goddamn Indians to death.” \n\n..\n\n&gt;Looking back, we can see that Indian policymakers achieved something remarkable in managing the geopolitical contradictions. They crafted a partnership with the Soviets to offset what was a formidable U.S.-Pakistan-China front. The nuggets also reveal how seriously China and the U.S. took Indian countermeasures and Moscow’s resolve to ensure that its ally emerged victorious.\n\nSources:\nhttps://swarajyamag.com/world/december-1971-when-the-us-sent-its-naval-ships-into-bay-of-bengal-and-ussr-responded\n\nhttps://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/50-years-freedom/1971-brink-nuke-war-222286\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/calling-the-uss-bluff-in-1971/article30341831.ece'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 't1493t'<br />Score:342<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t1493t/remembering_1971_when_the_us_threatened_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'On Ukraine and Russia - as someone who has lived in both countries (+ AMAA)'<br />Body: '**About me:** I have lived in both Ukraine and Russia (not for studies) and have been a geopolitical analyst. I have many close friends in both countries and I speak fluent Russian and some Ukrainian.\n\n**Why I am writing this post?** I see so many fellow Indians who have difficulty "choosing a side" or understanding why India is being neutral. Also, just trying to basically figure out what\'s going on in Ukraine. \n\nUnlikely that you will read all of it but if you have an ounce of interest and want to really figure out what\'s going on - sit back and read this with a cup of tea. \n\n#**History you should know:**\n\n\n- **Ukrainian and Russian history is extremely intertwined.** There are no direct comparisons for India here. It\'s not exactly like India/Pakistan fwiw. Ukraine and Russia share a history, culture, and relationship that go over a thousand years old - in a way, Russian history emerged from the area that is modern Ukraine. When you hear comments about Russia and Ukraine being "brotherly nations", it really is true. In fact, earlier Ukraine was known as *Malorussia* (\'Little Russia\').\n\n- **Ukrainian and Russian languages are very similar** (like Hindi and Marathi or even Maithali, probably). Note - most Ukrainians are bilingual and can understand both Russian/Ukrainian. \n\n- One **crucial point** is the wrong usage of "Russians in Ukraine". In Russian language, there are 2 terms for \'Russians\' - ethnic Russians are called Русский (Russkiy) and Russian citizens are called Россиянин (Rossiyanin). \nThis follows that, a person can be *Russkiy* but not *Rossiyanin* - due to the historical nature, they may be living in many countries like Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan etc apart from Russia itself.  Why is it important? Because Western media often makes this a Black &amp; White story when its not. A *Russkiy* in Ukraine (Russian with Ukrainian citizenship) would have extremely close ties (socio-culturual) with a *Russkiy Rossiyanin* (ethnic-Russian and Russian citizen) and would favor a closer/stronger relationship with Russia. Note two things - I said a stronger relationship which *does not* imply becoming a part of Russia itself. And that while this could be a majority position, this is not every ethnic Russians\' opinion.\n\n- **Both Russia and Ukraine share the same vices**: both are extremely corrupt and have oligarchs who just know how to suck money out of state resources. Importantly, I find citizens in both countries are very politically apathetic (in contrast to India). Personal opinion but this is why, claiming that one of the countries is a beacon of democray is just plain false.\n\n- **Crash course on Ukraine\'s internal economy:** Easten Ukraine (Donetsk, Lugansk, and Dnipro along with Kharkiv) have more population and industrial bases - industries in Donetsk/Lugansk naturally became destroyed after the Maidan. Kharkiv remains a major IT hub. Crimea is a massive tourist hub, fisheries industry, as well as has a strong Naval Base (always been controlled by Russians). Western (Lviv) and Central Ukraine (Kyiv) are primarily agrarian and service-oriented. West and East are divided right in the middle with River Dnieper.\n\n\n- **Modern Ukraine\'s current borders were, for a significant time in history**, under Russian Empire and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\'s rule**. By and large, Eastern Ukraine (Kharkiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, Dnipro) and Southern Ukraine (Odessa and Crimea) were a part of Russian Empire for ages, are predominantly Russian-speaking, and have majority ethnic Russians. Western Ukraine (Lviv, Lutsk) were part of PLC (Polis-Lithuanian Commonwealth), are predominantly ethnic Ukrainian, and Ukrainian-speaking, and have a stronger affinity to work/stay in Poland and Czech Republic. Kyiv is right in the middle - and is mixed in every sense of the word.\n\n- **During the Second World War,** while Ukraine - being part of the Soviet Union - fought valientl against fascists, many Ukrainians in the Western Ukraine sided with...the Nazis with one of their leaders being Stepan Bandera. Many viewed it as their "freedom struggle" against Nazis. In India too, Subashchandra Bose attempted to forge an alliance with Hitler but the difference is Bandera and his forces actually committed atrocities against the Communists and Polish peasants alike, making sure that modern Russia and Poland, both hate him equally. \n\n\n- **During the time of USSR,** some territories in the East/South (like Crimea) were "transferred" to Soviet Ukraine for better administrative management. Naturally, at that time, nobody foresaw that the USSR would break. Even once it broke down, there was no regard to transfer them back as people assumed that things between Russia and Ukraine would continue as is. \n\n\n#**Background information you should know:**\n\n- **Modern Ukraine came into being in August 1991**, amidst dissolution of the Soviet Union, via referendum. Interestingly, Eastern and Southern Ukraine had a very low % of "yes-" votes even at that time.\nSince that time, unfortunately, the country did not really have a very stable politics at all. \n\n- **Russian politics:** High-level overview for Russian politics is as follows - 90s were extremely tough time for Russia (and Ukraine). Many American supported organizations swept in to influence the country, Yeltsin came to the power who pretty much embarrassed every Russian, and Russia faced growing separatism in Chechnya. Ultimately, Putin came to the power and put an end to all that and cemented Russia\'s territorial integrity. Further, Putin also ensured that Russian economy leaps forth which it did, thanks to crumpling down on the oligarchs, some reforms, and rising oil prices. Russia\'s GDP per capita remainds higher than Ukraine/Belarus etc.\n\n- **Crimea:** Crimea has warm water ports and Russia had a deal with Ukraine to have Naval Base there. Not much is talked about it but Crimea actually had a Referendum back in 1994 as well which was based on demand for greater autonomy from Ukraine and closer ties with Russia. 80%+ votes favored it. Crimea - as to what I have observed and learned - was long ignored in terms of development by the politicians in Kyiv. While 2014 Referendum was illegitimate by all means, to this day, every independent poll says that Crimeans are glad to be with Russia.  \n\n- **Orange Revolution in Ukraine: (2004-2005)** was a turning event for Ukrainian politics when attempt to rig election failed and protests ensued. Why is it a turning event? Well, the event gave rise to many major parties in Ukraine today and one of the politicians to rig election was Yanukovych.\n\n- Ironically, **the people who did come to power (Yushchenko et al) were ineffective and made the Ukrainian economy go dive further.** Yushchenko was very hostile against Ukraine which alienated a big chunk of Ukrainian population and was ambitious for NATO membership. Ukraine\'s economy was one of the most affected during the 2008 Financial Crisis and this ultimately meant that Yanokovych came to the Power.\n\n- **Yanukovych Presidency (2010-14):** Yanukovych had heavy affinity towards Russia *but* proclaimed he would seek close ties with both the EU (to accommodate needs of Western Ukraine) and Russia while keeping Ukraine as a Neutral State, with no alliance in NATO/CSTO (Russia\'s version of NATO). He also tried to get Eastern Ukraine\'s votes suggesting to make Russian as a second state-language. Importantly, he continued the trend of being as corrupt as his predecessors. \n\n- **2013/14 Euromaidan Protests:** When time came to sign EU-Association agreement (which is *not* for EU membership but closer alliance) as per his earlier proclamation, Yanukovych decided to stall. This annoyed large portion of electorate and massive protests ensued.  My personal take is that these protests were directly supported by the US/EU and were an attempt at Color Revolution that was in trend. Yanukovych made a gaffe by using Special Forces against his own citizens, making sure that everyone was pissed. Ultimately, there was a change of power and Yanukovych was deposed - "coup" as per Russians (as due process wasn\'t followed and he had to run for his life) and "step towards democracy" according to the West (as people\'s protest implied they didn\'t want Yanukovych anymore). **This is where the historical close relations between Ukraine and Russia went downhill fast.**\n\n- **Far-right forces in Western Ukraine became further fueled** by Maidan. Following Maidan, Yanukovych was ousted and some atrocities were committed during the protests, particularly aimed at Russian-speaking East. Result: Growing separatism and discontent which ultimately transitioned to Russia annexing Crimea without a single shot and Donetsk and Lugansk forming resistance backed by Russia.  New President, Poroshenko, did not do much to solve this as any action against growing Ukrainization was now viewed as "siding with Russia". Strict quota against Russian language in media was introduced in Ukraine and many Russian websites were censored, topmost one being VK (which is like Russian Facebook). More and more people in the East felt alienated. Most political parties that represented Eastern Ukraine/pro-Russia view were sidelined or forcefully closed.\n\n- **Modern Ukraine started decommunization** in order to build a separate identity but let far-right fraction gain more and more influence in politics, army, and national discourse. This is an important point because a lot of modern neo-Nazi Ukrainians hail Bandera as their hero, do Nazi salutes, and this is the biggest reason why Putin says Ukraine has tons of Nazis/far-rights. Poroshenko also followed the corruption while paying lip service of moving towards the path of EU.\n\n- **After Poroshenko, Zelensky came to power** who had no political background to this but was extremely popular TV-actor. As tradition follows, previous President Poroshenko was found culprit of corruption and was charged with treason. Zelensky, who actually is ethnic Russian himself, did what politicians do and followed the rhetoric of strengthening Ukraine\'s own identity and affirmed that Ukraine would follow path to the EU and seek NATO membership. This was a turn from his earlier political campaign where he said there should be referendum in Ukraine for NATO membership, to ensure all voices were heard. Hostility in Donetsk and Lugansk continued and many protests against Zelensky continued as he inched towards authoritarianism. Interestingly, despite being a media person himself, he went on further with tighter restrictions around media and news.\n\n\n- In the backdrop of all this, events continued around the world (Second Libyan War, Syrian War) which further decimated Russias interests and soft power. Ukraine continued inching further towards the US and EU. Eastern Ukraine turned into a frozen conflict with many civilian casualties. \n\n\n#**Interests of Ukraine:**\n\nUkraine did not follow a specific and set foreign policy for a long time, firstly fixating on being a Neutral State, but the latest **ambition since 2014 is to towards the EU and NATO membership** (which is directly against Russian national interests). \n\n\n- **First and foremost, membership in the EU means heavy economic revival.** EU invests significantly in new countries, particularly in the East, and with new investment coming in, Ukraine would see economic boom.\n\n- **For Ukraine, this is also about being at Big/Good Boys Club** where they could not be kicked out, even if they act undemocratically (eg. Poland, Hungary, Turkey etc.) and can get bailed out despite economic mismanagement (eg. Greece, Cyprus). Combine this with the fact that many Ukrainians emigrate and have affinity to emigrate to the EU: an EU citizenship would mean no restrictions thereafter.\n\n- Ukraine\'s EU and NATO aspirations may be (my personal opinion) **heavily influenced by the geopolitics of Poland, which aims to consoldiate its soft power** within the EU by having Ukraine, Czechia, Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Baltic countries as allies, to hedge against German and French interests in the EU. Multitude of favorable appointments were given to ex-PMs, politicians, and bureaucrats of Poland/Baltics post 2014.\n\n- **Ukraine is also opposed to NS2 gas pipeline** (from Russia) which is recently constructed and provides direct access to Germany. Ukraine earns a significant commission from the gas pipeline that flows gas from Russia to the EU in the form of transit fee. This is extremely critical but lengthy point and several altercations have been there between Russia and Ukraine when it comes to Natural Gas.\n\n\n#**Interests of Russia:**\n\nFor Russian geopolitics, following countries matter the most as its **sphere of influence**: Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Caucasus (Georgia/Armenia/Azerbaijan). \n\n- For Russia, this is not about short to mid-term economic losses which they anyhow accounted for. They genuinely believe **the red line has been crossed and they had to intervene!** Everybody who I know in Russia - from average person to political class - does not want this war (note comment above about "brotherly nation") There are many family ties and cultural ties with Ukraine. And yet, many want that Ukraine strictly does not go for NATO membership, are aghast with (in their view) atrocities against Eastern Ukraine and that some action had to be taken.\n\n- **Soviet Union was verbally promised that the NATO borders will not move further Easterward after Germany**. They did. While every country is sovereign and have their interests and rights, for Soviet Union (and its successor state, Russia), with every move, they had to spend more and more on defence and protecting their interests. They view this as a subtle bullyism. There is **no** reason for nations to form a defense pact whose sole aim is to contain Russia: 1999 - Poland, Hungary, Czechia; and 7 Southern and Eastern European countries in 2004.\n\n- Recent events imo only sparked that further: remember protests in Belarus in 2020 (which they view as attempt of Color Revolutions) and very recent protests in Kazakhstan in late 2021. Every single event made Russian geopolitical analysts further believe that this is a direct and indirect encroachment by the US and its allies to fuel discontent into what Russia views as its sphere of influence.\n\n- **Recent comments (in last 1-2 years) by Ukrainian government about joining NATO alarmed Russia** - Putin ultimately realized that if Ukraine was going to join anyhow, then there better be a buffer zone by capturing Eastern Ukraine. Very few people in Russia want to have a war with Ukraine but they are super pissed about NATO encroachment and ignorance of DNR/LNR. According to Russians, the cost of war that residents in DNR/LNR (Donetsk and Lugansk) have paid for last 8 years is seldom mentioned in Western media if it does not align with the Western point of view. \n\n- **"But why should Russia have a say in what\'s happening in Ukraine? They should be free to follow their destiny"**. That\'d be true but realpolitik does not work that way - see "Cuban Missile Crisis" or "Monroe Doctrine".  US placed nuclear weapons in Turkey which led to the Soviet Union placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, less than few hundred kilometers to Florida. That sent the US war machinary into full-throttle and ultimately a resolution was reached when weapons from respective countries were pulled back. Similarly, Monroe Doctrine explicitly dictates that the entire Western Hemisphere is the US backyard. All in all, every major country tries to have a Sphere of Influence (in India\'s case, that\'d be Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and to a degree Bangladesh). Part of the reason why Indian diplomacy, army, and media alarmed when China tried to encroach around Bhutan.\n\n- And here is the thing: Ukraine is a flatland with its borders being &lt;500km to Moscow and to most strategic Russian resources and oil-fields. NATO forces there means direct threat to Russia and exorbitant amount of money and resources spent on defense and monitoring. **More importantly, this sets a precedent of losing one of the most important nation in its sphere of influence - which, as Putin declared, Russia will not accept.** \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Like this post?:** Upvote, award, share and spread the word:)\n\n**Got questions?** Ask away!'<br />Author: 'Vibgyor_5'  id: 't11znd'<br />Score:656<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t11znd/on_ukraine_and_russia_as_someone_who_has_lived_in/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'An Indian space startup developing high performance, non-carcinogenic space propulsion for satellites'<br />Body: 'Due to its high performance characteristics, hydrazine has dominated the space industry as the choice of propellant for satellites over six decades, despite its environment and health hazards and the challenges faced in its manufacturing, storage, ground handling and transportation.\n\nHydrazine will burn if given the opportunity. In fact, in the presence of oxygen (air), a catalyst (a spot of rust in a room, for example), and a small amount of heat, hydrazine will spontaneously explode.\n\nThese characteristics make it desirable as a fuel for satellites, but dangerous to the humans who are around it. Besides being highly and easily combustible, it is extremely toxic, caustic, and probably carcinogenic. Humans exposed to hydrazine vapor will suffer burns in the eyes, nose, mouth, esophagus, and respiratory tract. Severe burns can be fatal. Liquid hydrazine on the skin is quickly absorbed and acts as a neurotoxin. Burning hydrazine is extremely hot, but produces no visible flame (yes, it’s like invisible fire!) which can quickly spread to other combustible materials (clothes, skin, etc.).\n\nNewSpace India podcast Episode 72 - Tushar (CEO of Manastu Space) talks about how they are working replace old, low-performing, carcinogenic, and highly toxic hydrazine-based propulsion systems with high performance, non-carcinogenic, less toxic alternatives from India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen on \n\nApple Music/Podcast: [https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/developing-high-performance-non-carcinogenic-space/id1471664524?i=1000552207185](https://podcasts.apple.com/in/podcast/developing-high-performance-non-carcinogenic-space/id1471664524?i=1000552207185)\n\nGoogle Podcast: [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL25ld3NwYWNlLWluZGlh/episode/ODY1NTA4NDEtMTU3ZC00Mjg1LTk4M2YtNDdmYmQ3OWJlYjdm?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY9pn72pr2AhWDRmwGHX6FDJ8QkfYCegQIARAF](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL25ld3NwYWNlLWluZGlh/episode/ODY1NTA4NDEtMTU3ZC00Mjg1LTk4M2YtNDdmYmQ3OWJlYjdm?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY9pn72pr2AhWDRmwGHX6FDJ8QkfYCegQIARAF)\n\nSpotify: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/07BNJwqejzI2fSJyLgbN0R](https://open.spotify.com/episode/07BNJwqejzI2fSJyLgbN0R)\n\nOthers: [https://newspaceindia.transistor.fm/subscribe](https://newspaceindia.transistor.fm/subscribe)'<br />Author: 'NewSpaceIndia'  id: 't11no3'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t11no3/an_indian_space_startup_developing_high/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How to teach a rascal technician a lesson?'<br />Body: "\n\nFew months back, I went to Nehru Place, I had a spare old smartphone that was not switching on, so I thought to get it repaired so that it could be used as a backup.\n\n\nI went to this guy who took Rs.1700 to replace the battery and fix the motherboard. On returning, I somehow missed my SIM tray at his place and even he didn't offer to insert\xa0the\xa0SIM tray after fixing the\xa0device. After 1-2 days, I went to his shop to collect my SIM tray, upon checking, I found out that the SIM was not detected, so I told this to him. After multiple arguments, I could make him confess that it was he who damaged my smartphone's SIM tray because I was 100% certain that there was no issue in the SIM tray, it was only the issue that device was not powering on.\n\n\nAfter confessing that he damaged the SIM tray, he assured that he will fix it if he finds a spare SIM tray in the market, he called his contacts to know about the availability\xa0and since the device is quite old, he didn't find any old SIM tray, he asked me that he will try to arrange it from Gaffar Market, to which I agreed and returned to home. Thereafter, I contacted him 2-3 times to know whether he could arrange it or not, to which he denied.\xa0\n\n\nI kind of lost hope and got busy with my work, it had been 2 months since I last contacted him, yesterday I realised that I had kinda lost my Rs. 1700 to this person, got my smartphone damaged to the level it can't be repaired and contacted him whether he found the part or not. He contacted me after 5-10 minutes to say a no. I asked him to give me a solution as it was he who damaged my smartphone, he said that he has no solution and disconnected the phone. I contacted him again to tell that the least he can do to fix this issue is to refund the amount that he took to repair my smartphone as I cannot use the smartphone and this is where he took the u-turn and said that he didn't do any damage, he fixed the issue for what I submitted my device, it kinda anguished me about how can this rascal say like that when it is he only who screwed my device! I have had multiple heated arguments with this piece of shit and informed him that I have all the previous call recordings and even the audio recording of the chat I had at his place in Nehru Place and threatened to file a complaint in consumer\xa0court to\xa0which he\xa0didn't seem to be giving any shit. Later on, he disconnected my call saying he can't talk on the phone and asked to come to his place; and stopped picking my calls.\n\n\nNow I have a few options in hand\n\n1. Ignore the case as the device was an old 2015 model, though 20K INR at that time and bear the amount that he took for the repair and use the phone for other\xa0stuff\xa0but calls, take it as a lesson and let the Karma do its thing but it kinda looks insulting to me!\n\n2. Go at this shit's place with proper video recording on, create ruckus and record everything, teach him some lesson, ask him how dare he deny for the damage he did, ask to compensate for the\xa0damage he did so that he will think twice before practising such things again.\n\n3. Bad review to his business but it is not listed on Google map!\n\n4. (At fun point) Somehow distribute his number to credit card agents who call him 5-10 times per day to disturb him to not let him do his work properly and will cost him a piece.\n\n\nOption 1 seems more intelligent to pursue as I don't think it would be wise to channel my energy to create rukus as this would affect me mentally and will waste my time, I was kinda ignorant about the fact that my he damaged my device\xa0but the thing that offended me is how can this piece of shit deny that he didn't damage my device and what if the amount was considerably higher! This shit should be taught a lesson!\n\n\nAs proof, I have his shop's visiting card with details of the services he did, audio recording of the chat I had at his place, call recordings.\xa0\n\n\nI really thank you for reading this till here, I would really appreciate it if you could share your thoughts in this.\n\n\nThanks a lot."<br />Author: 'gpahul'  id: 't0zb63'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/t0zb63/how_to_teach_a_rascal_technician_a_lesson/</li>

We all have seen the murders of so many of us in just the last 10-20 days, but still nothing...... anywhere. Nobody is talking about this. Hindus are being killed but the victims are the peacefulls. Why is our narrative failing? Mainly because of the following reasons:\n\n1. We are the so called "Right Wing" of India, and Right Wing is the global villain right now. Anybody needs to bash something in a particular country, target their Right Wing.\n2. The Western Right Wing hates us because we are pagans, we are demons in their eyes. While the Western Left hates us because we are the so called "Fascists".\n3. We just keep barking the problem repeatedly without anyone even offering a solution.\n\nThere are many more reasons but this time I am going to discuss these. I think I have a somewhat solution to some of these.\n\nLeave the Right Wing title. There are 2 options here, first abandon the Left-Right classification system which quite clearly is not suitable for Indian politics, but this is not very practical as the opposition would still use it and nothing big would change. Instead what I propose is we adopt the title of "Left Wing", I know some of you won\'t like this, but the title of Right Wing was never ours to begin with. In Indian case, these are just tags without any real meaning. So if can benefit from adopting it, **DO IT FUCKING NOW.** Also adopt their other tags such as "Secular". \n\nI will provide an example, consider the headline, "Peaceful girls demand to be allowed to wear Hijab in schools." and now consider a different headline for the same case, "Hindus demand Uniform Dress Code for all students and keeping the schools secular". Just a change in headlines can change the entire narrative on its head even if the content of the article is kept same.\n\nIf we can change this narrative, we gain a huge advantage. The way forward begins with us, refer to ourselves as the Left Wing and parties like Congress, etc. as the "Right Wing" and now suddenly we are the secularists and they are the one demanding Bislamicisation of India.\n\nIn any post, any comment, any form of communication we make, from now on\n\n**WE ARE THE LEFT WING!**'<br />Author: 'kedarkhand'  id: 'sznglz'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sznglz/the_struggle_for_our_collective_survival/</li>

I have a keen interest in trying to understand our national Politics and Government structure. \n\nI have seen some comments on Tamil Nadu such as we are Dravidian Nationalists or Tamil Supremacy guys or Periyar Followers. Some comments may be just jokes but some comments seem to be serious about their stand or understanding Tamil Nadu. I can assure you that Tamil Nadu is not on the way to becoming the next Kashmir-like situation or all the Dravidian political supporters are separatists. Tamil Nadu has strong economic and political interests in keeping the Indian Union as one Country.\n\nAny Separatists or Insurgency guys are a small minority of politicians and idiots who are hungry for power. I agree there is some serious opposition to various policies of the Modi government such as the Financial Policy and Education policy. Since we are in a Democratic Republic opposition must be there so the Ruling Government will be in check. Certain acts committed by the DMK Government are also not much popular such as the demolition of 08+ Temples. \n\nStrong unity among the States and people is much needed for facing external and internal threats and for continuing in terms of Economic growth too. Personally, I am extremely proud to be an Indian.\n\nThe question of LTTE (Tamil Insurgency Group in Sri Lanka) posters people a lot it seems. Did the People of Tamil Nadu support LTTE financially and ideologically? Yes, our fathers and Grandfathers have supported them. There is a reason for it Tamil Speaking people in Northern Sri Lanka were stripped of their political and economical rights during the earlier days of the Srilankan Republic that led to the Sri Lankan Civil war.

One State Department official may have passed on to Pakistan Indian intelligence reports on Khalistani terrorists that New Delhi had shared with Washington. In 1992, the State Department threatened to impose economic sanctions on India after it refused permission for US sleuths to go on an aerial-photography mission along the Sino-Indian border. In 1994, it warned New Delhi that if R&amp;AW did not halt covert missions in Pakistan, the United States would "act against India"*** (p 5).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Moving back to 1971, Raman chronicles the decision of India\'s then-prime minister Indira Gandhi to deploy the two-and-half-year-old R&amp;AW into action as the East Pakistan crisis deepened. R&amp;AW trained Bengali guerrillas and organized a psychological-warfare campaign against Pakistani rulers. Almost every day, Indira had at her disposal bugged extracts from telephonic conversations of the Pakistani top brass on the evolving situation. She did not make a single decision on the Bangladesh issue without consulting the R&amp;AW chief, R N Kao.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Between 1969 and 1971, clandestine units of R&amp;AW disrupted Chinese-backed Naga and Mizo insurgent traffic, sanctuaries and infrastructure in Myanmar and East Pakistan. The Richard Nixon administration in Washington initiated a joint program with Islamabad to hit back at India by encouraging a separatist movement among the Sikhs of Punjab. The US National Security Council, led by Henry Kissinger, sponsored allegations in the press and public forums of violations of Sikhs\' human rights. US interest in the Khalistan insurgency remained firm up to 1984.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Intriguingly, R&amp;AW and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) simultaneously colluded to prevent a possible Chinese takeover of northern Burma. George H W Bush, the director of the CIA from 1975-77, became a personal friend of Kao. Later, when Bush was US vice president, Kao succeeded in persuading him to turn off the aid tap to Khalistani terrorists. Raman comments here that "benevolence and malevolence go side by side in relations between intelligence agencies" (p 42).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the mid-1970s, Kao sensed the urgency of enabling R&amp;AW to collect intelligence about US movements in the Indian Ocean region. He cobbled together a liaison relationship with the French and Iranian intelligence agencies to monitor the Americans, an oddity given that the shah of Iran was among the closest allies of the United States. ***To Raman, R&amp;AW\'s present capacity to stalk the US remains weak. He chides the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for "not seeming to be unduly concerned about it"*** (p 48).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shortly after R&amp;AW\'s creation in 1968, Kao arranged a secret liaison relationship with Israel\'s Mossad to "learn from its counter-terrorism techniques" (p 127). In the early 1980s, Pakistan was genuinely worried about the chances of a joint Indo-Israeli operation to destroy its uranium-enrichment plant at Kahuta. For 12 years, Mossad officers were posted in New Delhi under the cover of South American businessmen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An interesting development Raman mentions is secret meetings in the late 1980s between the chiefs of R&amp;AW and Pakistan\'s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) that were facilitated by Prince Talal of Jordan. The ISI denied harboring Khalistani terrorists but, outside media glare, it did hand over to R&amp;AW some Sikh deserters of the Indian Army.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raman favors exchanges of this sort over inane joint counter-terrorism mechanisms, so that the top spooks of both countries meet each other periodically without a formal agenda and "compare notes on developments of common interest" (p 234).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Raman partially blames the lack of objectivity of R&amp;AW\'s branch dealing with Bangladesh for the decline in its performance in India\'s eastern frontier after 1975. Witchhunts by politicians, nepotism, discriminatory internal security checks, minimal interaction between senior and junior officers, permissiveness and trade unionism have added to R&amp;AW\'s woes over the years.*** Persisting frictions over recruitment and inter-service seniority "come in the way of R&amp;AW officers developing an *esprit de corps* even 39 years after formation of the organization" (p 133).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;K Santanam of R&amp;AW\'s science and technology division was the first to assess that Pakistan was covertly constructing a uranium-enrichment plant. He systematically monitored developments relating to Pakistan\'s nuclear program, including the procurement racket of Abdul Qadeer Khan. Raman reveals that, in an unguarded moment, Indian prime minister Morarji Desai indiscreetly told Pakistani dictator Zia ul-Haq that he was aware of Islamabad\'s nuclear schemes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***R&amp;AW trained the intelligence officers of many independent African countries and assisted the anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa and Namibia. Retired R&amp;AW officers were deputed to work in training institutes of intelligence agencies of some African states. Raman terms it a pity that R&amp;AW frittered away its\xa0goodwill in Africa through subsequent negligence, ceding ground to China.*** In 1971, R&amp;AW counterinsurgency specialists also empowered the Sri Lankan government to crush the uprising of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the context of some R&amp;AW reports on Khalistani terrorists proving wrong, Raman avers that "lack of coordination in trans-border operations, often resulting in inaccurate, misleading and alarming reporting, continues to be the bane of our intelligence community" (p 97). Kao was crestfallen at the negligence and lax supervision of senior staffers of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) that allowed Indira Gandhi\'s assassination in 1984.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Likewise, Raman\'s cautions about a threat to the life of Rajiv Gandhi from Sri Lankan Tamil extremists "were treated with skepticism" by the intelligence community with fatal consequences. "Everybody in Delhi" was convinced that they "would never harm Rajiv because he and his mother had helped them more than any other Indian leader" (p 236).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raman bluntly notes that Indian security agencies "rarely admit their deficiencies. That is why we keep moving from one tragedy to another" (p 244). The IB\'s jealousies, reservations and prejudices against R&amp;AW leave much to be desired and fragment India\'s intelligence faculties. Two parallel setups in the IB and R&amp;AW are a duplicating luxury that the Indian taxpayer is burdened with.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raman devotes many words to weaknesses in R&amp;AW\'s counterintelligence capability that came to the fore in the 1980s. The French intelligence agency penetrated the Indian Prime Minister\'s Office, and the CIA was found to be collecting documents in R&amp;AW\'s Chennai office. The recent defection of R&amp;AW\'s Rabinder Singh to the US after years of undetected service as a CIA mole reflects the sorry state of affairs. Last year, the CIA was reported to have infiltrated India\'s National Security Council Secretariat. Raman envisages a day when "the sensitive establishments of this country have been badly penetrated under the guise of intelligence cooperation" (p 255).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Linguistic weaknesses of R&amp;AW staff often come in the way of analytical and operational work in India\'s surroundings, thanks to a "needless fascination for west European languages" (p 130). MI5, now known as the British Security Service, had "more Punjabi-Gurumukhi-knowing experts than the IB and the R&amp;AW put together" (p 152). Raman also finds fault with the structure of India\'s national-security management under the governments of Atal Bihair Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, wherein the chief of R&amp;AW has been reduced to a subordinate of the national security adviser with little direct access to the prime minister.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Though Raman exonerates R&amp;AW from the charge of politicization in comparison with the IB and the Central Bureau of Investigation, ***he admits that R&amp;AW officials gave "ideas" to prime minister Rajiv Gandhi to cover up the controversial Bofors kickback scandal. Bofors "brought out some of the worst traits in our intelligence and investigative agencies" (p 177). Yet it was during Rajiv\'s reign that R&amp;AW, particularly its Pakistan division, regained strong covert-action capacity that could "bite again".***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was in the Rajiv era that R&amp;AW played a key behind-the-scenes role in normalization of New Delhi-Beijing relations and launched a hotline between its chief and his Chinese counterpart. The political leaders of the two countries could also use it to avoid the normal diplomatic channel. During the first Gulf War of 1991, Chinese intelligence offered oil supplies to India to overcome any shortages that might crop up. Overall, Raman considers R&amp;AW to be inadequate in analyzing data on China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the end of the Cold War, R&amp;AW harnessed its closeness to Russian intelligence to secure assurances that whatever the changes in political dispensation in Moscow, there would be no wavering in its friendly stance toward India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On India\'s fiasco in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1989, Raman terms it Rajiv\'s folly and not R&amp;AW\'s. However, he does take many senior officers of security agencies, including R&amp;AW, to task for "egging him on into more and more unwise actions" (p 208). R&amp;AW was outstanding in the 1990s in intercepting communications and naval arms smuggling of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When the insurgency began in Indian Kashmir in 1987, R&amp;AW jammed Pakistani broadcasts and telecasts and reverse-broadcast Indian propaganda in Pakistani Kashmir. It mobilized anti-Pakistan elements in the Muslim community in India as well as the subcontinental Muslim diaspora in Europe. It strengthened networking with various segments of Pakistan\'s political class and civil society that were "well disposed towards India" (p 227). R&amp;AW also began building contacts with mujahideen leaders in Afghanistan who were unhappy with the insidious role of the ISI in their country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***After the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, the first act of mass-casualty terrorism on the ground in India, R&amp;AW pieced together credible evidence of the direct hand of the ISI. Kao remarked at that time in disgust that, in spite of solid proof, "the US will never act against Pakistan for anything it does to India". Raman adds wryly that "this is as valid today as it was in the past"*** (p 277).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Raman concludes that R&amp;AW is like "the proverbial curate\'s egg, good in parts" and requiring genuine improvements in crisis prevention, intelligence analysis, and coordination with fellow agencies in India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A treasure trove of unknown information and incidents that mark a much misunderstood and maligned agency, this book is a frank account of cloak-and-dagger agents who defend Indian interests through deniable acts.'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'szcpoo'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/szcpoo/in_1992us_threatened_economic_sanctions_on_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Need a little favour'<br />Body: "I am a guy in mid twenties, unemployed. I'm trying to get a job but still in progress. The thing is I've been in home for a long time now like two years and so depressed, totally burnt out of my mind and brain. My parents argue all the time and it's become more recently and my mom cries, and sometimes fall to ground and says death is better than living. And I have to face that horror.\n\nThe thing is recently a lot has happened in my sibling's marriage where dad made a decision of choosing a girl but my mom didn't like the girl and their family. One time, mom fell to the ground in kitchen and just passed out. I thought she died. My heart stopped. My mind also stopped. Mom takes so much tension because of this marriage thing. Our family was happy but tbh, this marriage totally destroyd mom and dad. Even dad said to my masi on phone, that he would jump from building and commit suicide. Mom and dad argue, I am in next room, they argue upto 1-2 am daily. I listen to their conversations. Tried to put earbuds but still my mind forces me to listen. It's not something you could ignore.\n\nSo every now and then, even dad argues and now says he made a big mistake. Now, also my dad is in debt and almost all of his salary goes into the loans and debts, etc. Some days ago had to sell mom's jewellery and she cries ocassionally. So, mom tells me to help dad out because it's my responsibility. She is right but due to my mental health, I feel deep regrets, helplessness and almost everyday feeling suicidal and reading suicide posts , depression posts for comfort. I'm in my room all the time. It makes me sick sometimes to be this big and still a complete nalayak. Even my brother harrasses dad for money every now and then. He earns but don't know he is kind of shady and in 5-6 months, asked dad for total like 1.5 lakh. Says credit card dues. I call bullshit. Even my mom received 2 calls that said that your son hasn't paid 10k, 5k. They were lending apps. Mom felt so shame at that time. Brother has borrowed 20k from my mama but hasn't paid and don't plan to pay that's I'm sure. Mama calls dad and mom everyday saying where's the money. Money has made everyone mad to the point they fight with each other. I am 100 percent sure I will not marry anyone even if god tells me. I don't want to maintain relations. Life has given me enough trauma. This new trauma and the old trauma of education system where you become suicidal when you fail.\n\nI was a good person trying to achieve things but somehow everything ended in a disaster. I blame myself for not doing enough for the family and it's eating me up constantly like the feeling when your mind just waiting to explode and it's better to just not think anything but you are trapped and have no choice but to sleep but then even you can't sleep because your thoughts don't leave your mind.\n\nMy mind is not able to fix this thing out. I am not able to focus and even think about my career. My time is running out. Regrets and I'm feeling stuck in a loop all over again. I don't have the money. I want to go the himalayan mountains via bus as i live in northern india, for 3-4 days to get my mind a lift, but I don't have anything except 100 rupees that I have since the last 3 months.  I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't talk to anyone and stay in room online. It feels like suffocating. I listened to people and most said you need a breather. Please I'm seeking for help here asking for help me out via donations(3k-4k will be enough). I'm not asking much (I will return when I'm capable). I will just vanish and pick a bus from bus stand and forget about everything for 3 days."<br />Author: 'Glittering-Play6655'  id: 'szbwqp'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/szbwqp/need_a_little_favour/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Our society and liberalism'<br />Body: "Hey everyone,\n\nThis has been going on in my mind for some time. Why do the people who label themselves as liberals in our country seem to be so against hinduism?\n\nhis has been going on in my mind for some time. Why but a couple days ago a friend of mine got banned from there just for asking a genuine question. So, I am not sure about the fairness of the mods there anymore. Let's see what happens here.With that in mind here's my thoughts.his has been going on in my mind for some time. Why do the people who label themselves as liberals in our country seem to be so against hinduism?\n\nBut before I go into that I should at least give a brief introduction about my beliefs so as to make clear from where I am asking the question.\n\nI am from odisha and from a hindu family, neither a brahmin nor from a reserved caste. I became an atheist during my post 12th years, not because of anyone's influence or internet, it was mostly personal introspection. Then I fashioned myself as a christian for sometime, not as a game or pettiness, it was curiosity on my part. After six months I left christianity too. \n\nI became an agnostic.\n\nNow here is the thing. All this was known by my family. Of course at first they were unhappy about it but after some useful discussions, they more or less accepted it. So, I never had any reason to resent hinduism because i didn't really face any obstacles in my spiritual journey from my parents or anyone else. This gave me time to evaluate religion from a neutral point of view.\n\nHinduism is like an open source software. From ancient times hinduism has incorporated different and new traditions and culture segments from indigenous tribes into itself to give a place to them into its system while maintaining its own uniqueness. Now this is hinduism's greatest strength in my opinion. Tolerance and incorporation of local and foreign compatible beliefs into itself is one of the reasons why hinduism has existed for thousands of years. And this is a very important word, tolerance.\n\nPeople seem to misunderstand this term sometimes when applied to religion. In my opinion, tolerance is multidimensional when it comes to religion. Personal tolerance and group tolerance are connected but not the same thing. Kind of like a subset of Jung's personal and social collective unconsciousness. \n\nA group of ten individuals may tolerate if someone mocks their religion but that doesn't mean they will forget it. The mocking prints itself unto their subconscious while they go on with their lives. They move closer to their tolerance limit point as does the group. The group reaches its breaking point when the first individual crosses his/her personal tolerance limit point and pushes the other individuals past their tolerance limit points.\n\nNow here is an interesting thing. When someone feels they are being mocked, it does not matter if they are being actually mocked, what is important is if they perceive that they are being mocked. This is where most liberals in our country fail to make a difference. Mocking a person who has his/her belief centered around a faith system is the opposite of liberal values.\n\nI will give a comparison to showcase it. Most liberals believe in proper rights and freedom of expression of lgbtq community. As do I. But they fail to show that same courtesy to a fellow religious indian. Here i will share one of my personal experiences which some of you here may have also experienced in your life. \n\nIt's about the time when transgender gangs used to bully train passengers into giving them money. I was studying in north india and during every train journey i would be subject to their bullying .There were three major causes for my silence to their bullying.1. I used to travel alone, 2. I was suffering from puberphonia, 3. I was a victim of bullying from my school days. Nonetheless their bullying continued and resentment festered in my mind for Indian transgenders.\n\nAfter my graduation, a male of friend of mine was sexually harassed by a male in a bus. This somehow gave me a new perspective on my thoughts regarding transgenders. My resentment was gone for the community as a whole and I accepted that the behavior of a few can't be blamed on a community when their behavior didn't stem from an ideological point of view but from personal circumstances. I could now see how a person can be molded and made because of a single defining issue in their life. Transgenders suffer from an identity crisis in India and it molds them . I suffered from bullying and that made me into what I am. Most liberals will agree with this point of view and yet they can't seem to do that for a common hindu. \n\nOdisha is called the land of lord jagannath. There are lots of people here who consider the lord not only their god but a father who watch over them. Some of odia's lives revolve around the lord. It's part of their identity. And if someone disrespects their lord, they will get upset which is rational.\n\nWhy do liberals not understand that it's not about whether religions are true or not, it's about how deep an idea is embedded inside a person's life. \n\nBut does that mean we can't criticize religions? We can when it's affecting our individual liberty and national integrity and security. After all we are Indians first and everything else later. My personal experience when I moved to live in a brahmin society during my job training was a learning experience. There was a temple which used to ring loud bells early in the morning. After a couple of days of getting disturbed, I confronted the temple priest. At first he was defensive of it but then I had a long conversation with him about lord krishna , lord budhha and lord jesus christ on duty, tolerance and individual liberty. We came to an agreement and the bells didn't ring so loudly anymore. Sound was kept inside the temple.\n\nSimilarly public rath yatra got canceled the year covid struck. Public safety comes before a religious event after all.\n\nThis is the case for most hindus. Personally yes I don't believe in any existing religion but I also see religions and gods as part of an identity and not always anti-science or anti-liberty. Hindus mostly keep to their religion and don't bother any non-hindus regarding belief systems( there are individual cases of course who try to lecture people on religious purity but they are still statistically insignificant). But they have a right to get angry if they feel their beliefs are getting mocked just like lgbtq community has the right to be offended against any perceived insults. \n\nWhat we should do as Indians is to create harmony and not dissent amongst others. We shouldn't slap a level on people , at least not on the internet where we have no concrete idea about a person's character sitting behind the screen. Not really a political statement but we should support our government's innovative policies and protest or even give constructive criticism to bad policies. \n\nIn my opinion most influential individuals who tweet stuff , be it pro or anti hindu, have their own agenda. We should not be picking sides and calling on their hypocrisy.\n\nThe above two paragraphs are what Indian liberalism should stand for and yet Indian liberals most of the time are so far away from it. Why is that? Misguided youth or some hidden agenda behind it? As a common man, I can never find any unbiased answer probably. And yet I am curious about the  nature of liberalism in this country. \n\nI am an agnostic, but I do believe that eradication of religions as some atheists and liberals feel will magically solve all the problems of our country isn't a mature take on the issue. Because without religions, humans will just group together using something else. Be it any idea, local identity, mother tongue or even scientific alignment, people will again form tribes or communities . I get a chuckle whenever I imagine sometimes two groups called pro m-theory or anti m-theory. \n\nI feel given enough time and spread of new ideas and awareness to a greater potential, hinduism can adapt and evolve into a modern form and move towards a more progressive future. \n\nPlease don't treat my thoughts as an advocation of hinduism but rather an attempt for cooperation and harmony between different ideologically different groups. To point out morally wrong ideologies isn't just our right but also our duty. And hinduism is no exception to it. But the criticism , the motive behind it decides how it is received by a person. Derogatory insults or mocking doesn't make for good criticisms but logically coherent arguments do.\n\nThank you for reading and please share your thoughts as well as feel free to point out any mistakes I made in the post."<br />Author: 'Everything_is_rubber'  id: 'szaszp'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/szaszp/our_society_and_liberalism/</li>

This is important for all of us here who can be next because no one in the world gives a damn about us. Here's what you need to do to ensure you're strong enough to protect yourself:\n\n\n1. Learn a Martial Art. Join any class near you and start it ASAP. This is absolutely important. MMA also has an added advantage of getting you in the shape of your life and if you've always wanted to go abroad you can go for competitions through your training centre. Sunshinken and Crosstrain are the best in Delhi, search for ones in your town. Now how do these benefit you in the current political scenario? Simple. There are many techniques that are taught for you to safeguard yourself and you can easily learn holds, tricks to protect you and most importantly: How to tackle people holding knives and lethal weapons (Krav Maga too is a great art for the same). Use these for your self defense and you'll never have to worry about getting attacked. Get your sisters enrolled too, it's high time we learn how to defend ourselves before it's too late.\n\n\n2. Fix your diet. Yes, lay off that carb-rich Indian food and switch to something that provides you much more protein. Get healthy and fit and prepared for anything that life throws at you. Added benefit of keeping you happy throughout.\n\n\n3. Workout (Or do a sport/any fitness activity). Crossfit is great, these days there's yoga/pilates that's the new hype. Basically, get yourself into a good shape and be strong enough to handle anything that's thrown at you. Added benefit I don't need to tell you guys, working out is something we're never taught since school and it's high time we include fitness and self defence in our daily activities.\n\n\n\nI also am willing to gift gold to anyone who posts their progress in a month on what they've learnt through MMA/What they've achieved through workout and diet control.

I understand that Russia has been the "All weather friend" of India but India also has its democratic and sovereigntic principles on the line. \n\n3. In case of a war, there will be huge sanctions by the west which will deter Russia from cutting it\'s ties with India. Russia will need the Indian money more than ever.\n\n4.

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Empire || Ch 3: Yavana Kanda || 3.4. Face negotiation theory'<br />Body: ' *"The East bowed low before the blast, in patient, deep disdain; she let the legions thunder past, and plunged in thought again."* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**—3.4. Face negotiation theory—**\n\nShe sat across from Chanakya, as if she were his student – although she had never been sufficiently qualified for admission to any gurukula, much less Taxila, and much less that of the famed Professor Chanakya. She had heard much of Chanakya from before this, of course, as had everyone else – revered philosopher, brilliant political scientist, mysterious strategist; unmatched in cunning and ambition, both academic and political as they said – and she watched as he absently snapped his fingers mid-speech.\n\n“It is a situation where you *know* the other party will agree to your demands,” the learned Brahmin was saying, “But honour compels them to put up a pretence of resistance, and your task becomes simply to arrange a conversational situation that makes it possible for them to concede while saving face.”\n\nPrincess Pskaradharini – long-haired, bright-eyed, and adorning an expression much less serious than her usual, yet still far too stern for her youthful face – cast a smile his way. Though exhausted by the day’s work (and Chanakya was certainly no kind supervisor), she was the sort that found intellectual conversation – especially with a scholar so brilliant as Chanakya – to be rejuvenating, rather than a cause for further exhaustion (or at least so she told herself, even though she had encountered it to be that as well). \n\n“You must be grateful for my intervention, then?” she suggested proudly.\n\n“What did you say, again?”\n\nPskaradharini took a quarrelsome pose. “*Arya!*” she cried, “It was I who asserted, to my father, that it is not our place, as Kshatriyas, to debate philosophy with you – that the urgency of the situation requires us to simply comply with your orders, that inefficiency is not the Kshatriya duty.” She paused. “I quite liked what you said – that the Kshatriya’s duty is to protect his elements of sovereignty: himself, the minister, the treasury, the fort, the army, the country and the ally – I have never quite heard it put that way, it was quite intriguing … and that by forsaking this duty, whether in the name of honour or anything else, we forfeit our caste … what you said about our duty to the living exceeding that to the wishes of the dead … and about Arjuna being the true hero of the Kurukshetra war … ”\n\nShe noticed that Chanakya was giving her an odd look, and bit her lip, embarrassed. “I’m just repeating your words. Forgive me, Professor – I do not usually ramble so.” Pskaradharini shifted nervously, then asked with great care: “Are there any other examples you can think of – of people putting up a pretence of resistance in order to maintain an illusion of honour?”\n\nChanakya hummed thoughtfully, then said: “Well, Malavika \\[1\\], Brahmins of old said the same habit belonged to the Salvas who invaded the Kuru country – they had to be told twice for everything.”\n\n“Oh.” \n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“Do you think the alliance will hold? That these kings will all forget their historical enmities to unite against a common enemy?”\n\n“I believe I have arranged the exchange of hostages satisfactorily,” said Chanakya. “Whether they will be able to satisfactorily extract all the benefits of alliance, depends on our work here.”\n\nThere was another question, which bothered Pskaradharini deeply – for all that she respected Chanakya, his cunning was intimidating, and his motives remained mysterious. \n\n“I must ask, though, Chanakya … why did you ask King Purushottama to surrender to the Greeks, but the rulers of the Southern Punjab to unite in resistance?” \n\nEven when the reverse option was clearly more natural – King Purushottama could not *possibly* be convinced to submit without a fight, while it was truly an accomplishment that Chanakya had united the Malavas, Kshudrakas and Sibis in alliance. Pskaradharini had never been one to pay much heed to gossip, and yet she could not help but recall the rumours she had heard, about the Greek girl whom Chanakya had taught, could not help but doubt his motivations – such as if he was uniting the tribes for the purpose of eventually betraying them for the Greeks to use them as a fighting force. And each “secretive” task he made Pskaradharini do only increased her suspicions of him.\n\n“As you may have suspected, Malavika, I do have undisclosed intentions—” her heart sank, “—but these intentions are not unrighteous, if that is what you fear.”\n\nThe princess also knew that if Chanakya *did* have such wicked intentions, they would be more complicated than anything that she could imagine – and could not be defeated by any action of hers. And she was also not so foolish as to betray him out of fear of being betrayed – she had learned, from her brother who had secured admission to Taxila and had heard Chanakya speak, that such was the mistrust that could be sowed or exploited by enemies.\n\n“Can you disclose these intentions to me, Chanakya?” she asked with uncharacteristic meekness.\n\n“There is much that I must disclose to you,” he said. “After the war.”\n\nMalavika felt her heart beat faster. “After defeating the Greeks?”\n\n“After the war.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Peace, dependent upon honesty or oath is immutable both in this and the next world. It is for this world only that a security or an hostage is required for strengthening the agreement. Honest kings of old made their agreement of peace with this declaration: We have joined in peace.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 7.17:5-6\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Great King Purushottama.”\n\nThe sudden appearance of the young scholar in the courtroom startled said king and chief minister – a remarkable feat in general – and in the cloudy darkness and with his untied hair blowing in whatever monsoon winds made their way indoors, the Brahmin looked like a storm had entered the palace.\n\n“Professor Chanakya,” the chief minister addressed the guest, his tone a mixture of respect and fear. \n\n“There appears to be much pompous drinking and dancing this evening in Shuktimati,” the Professor commented. “I suppose that the people of the Punjab outside of Gandhara need no cause for celebration.” \n\nThe king was silent, and it was the minister that spoke once more.\n\n“Honoured Professor – there is *much* cause for celebration. Our kingdom’s territory has been doubled under Greek overlordship – why, even Alexander was impressed by the Great King’s bravery—”\n\nPurushottama was increasingly embarrassed with each word of the minister’s – for he had an objection to each one of them, but could not voice them, either due to complications with preserving his honour, or due to political considerations that restrained his tongue – and he was interrupted by Chanakya, who said:\n\n“I am glad to see, Minister, that you are not too upset by your kingdom’s humiliation in battle – or over the lives of your dead soldiers.”\n\nThe minister was outraged. \n\n“*Professor*! You cannot possibly fault the king for this loss – Alexander’s army was twice the size of his!”\n\n“Alexander’s army was twice the size of yours, and yet, knowing this, you marched your soldiers to their death in a battle whose result was known to you from the start, even as you denied it in the hope of absurd miracles. Your humiliation is not your loss itself – but the foolishness that lead to it. My admonishment is not of your strength, but of your intellect and your valuation of your peoples’ lives and wealth. You may celebrate that Alexander happened to be impressed by your valour and has treated you kindly after defeating you in battle, just as a gambler may celebrate his unlikely win – such tales of winning against the odds make for good tales for plays and poetry, but they are not guides on decision-making.”\n\nThis time, the Minister was silent.\n\n“Forgive me,” said King Purushottama at last. “Forgive me, Professor, for not hearing your advice – for casting doubt on your motives. You did, in fact, tell us so.” \n\nBut Chanakya held up a hand.\n\n“Very well. Those are matters of the past. What matters now is this: *what have you learned from this battle?* What have either of you learned?”\n\nWhen both listeners were silent, Chanakya continued. “Their formations are exceedingly simple,” he stated, “A phalanx of spearmen, with some cavalry to flank. Yet they possess one great advantage that is almost sufficient to explain their victory over yours. Do you know what this is, Minister?”\n\nThe king and minister opened their mouths – probably to make some cliché suggestions – but Chanakya ignored them and continued: \n\n“Much of the theory of battle without losses has simply to do with range. This is why swords have advantage over knives; why archery has advantage over swords; and why horse archers have even more advantage. It is why catapults are preferred over siege engines or elephants in tearing down walls.” \n\n“Do you suggest that we switch to spear-centred melee forces?” the minister questioned.\n\nBut Chanakya shook his head. “In the civilized world, we use swords for their flexibility against light infantry – but with people like the Greeks who spend vast resources to recruit primarily heavy infantry, that is ineffective. But it is not the case that the most effective counter-play to a particular weapon is that weapon itself. I have yet to determine quite what the optimal method to fight against long spears is … ”\n\nThe king and the minister watched Chanakya silently and admiringly – despite him earlier chastising them without regard for title or power – as he thought and strategized aloud, something that he almost never did, for concern for secrecy (and this should have alarmed them that Chanakya had some further hidden agenda behind his actions, but they found themselves overwhelmed by his charisma and persuasiveness).\n\n“Perhaps some kind of defensive mechanism against spearpoint … of course it would be childish to expect an offensive weapon that simply *combines* the range of long spears with the flexible movements and attack of a sword … Minister.”\n\n“Tell me, Professor.”\n\n“Give me your staff, the royal scale, and a whip.” \n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\nA short while later, Purushottama found the fabrics of his throne shredded, and Chanakya was seated atop it.\n\n“Indeed,” said the Professor, “The flexible nature of a whip allows it an even greater range of motion as a sword of equal weight with equal effort, while maintaining the longitudinal range of a spear or greater. Do you see what I am saying, Minister?”\n\nTwo heads shook. The minister asked skeptically: “Do you suggest that we use *whips* in battle, Professor?”\n\nChanakya looked annoyed. “There is a certain steel produced in the Southern extreme of Jambudvipa \\[2\\],” he said, “Which is known to metallurgists everywhere as the finest in the world. And although this property is not one that is of common use at present, this steel can be expertly molded to form flexible blades in the shape of whips.”\n\n“What do you want of us, Professor?” asked the king.\n\n“I request your permission to build a wing of the University of Taxila at Shuktimati,” Chanakya announced to a shocked audience. “To teach the manufacture and use of this type of sword. Alexander will be suspicious if Taxila were to start expanding its military so soon – but for you, Purushottama, with your vanquished army, it is only natural for you to begin rebuilding your army—”\n\n“*Professor*—”\n\n“—What we need, King, is a fighting force that is unfamiliar to the Greeks, and therefore cannot be exploited by them, and we must build that fighting force under their very noses. Your country is the natural choice for this.”\n\n“You wish for me to enter into an alliance with Gandhara?” asked the king, “To forget the traitorous past of your people, the descendants of the wicked Shakuni, their spineless submission to the Persians for centuries!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nPurushottama considered this proposal with deep suspicion. He did not consider himself a grudgeful man who would allow petty enmities to compromise grander goals, like the preservation of the culture of the Aryas and the Vedic way from Greek incursions – never in his stable reign had he made a decision contrary to the honour and well-being of his people. \n\nYet, an alliance with Taxila was precisely what Alexander had been coercing him into, and Chanakya’s insistence on an identical agenda on *opposite* grounds – under the argument that it would *weaken* the Greeks – was a cause for distrust, a cause to believe that this might be a ploy by Alexander, either to force him to do his bidding, or to test his loyalty, or both. There was cause to resist changes for their own sake – and that cause was to avoid being manipulated into the destruction of one’s own self and line, one’s *elements of sovereignty*, as Professor Chanakya might have called it. \n\nAnd yet the fruit offered by Chanakya – even as the offer was unspoken – was too sweet to refuse so simply. After an animated back-and-forth with his minister (during which Chanakya waited patiently on the throne of Shuktimati), the king made his decision.\n\n“Very well, Professor,” announced Purushottama, “I will admit the alliance under some acceptable terms. But I have one condition.”\n\n“Do tell, Great King.”\n\n“I have a daughter, Yashomati, who has attained marriageable age—”\n\n“—certainly, I could arrange for her marriage to the crown prince of Taxila—”\n\n“No, Professor,” Purushottama politely interjected. “I wish to give her in marriage, to *you*.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Marriage precedes the other calls of life.* \n\n*(\\*) The giving in marriage of a maiden well-adorned is called Brahma marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) The joint-performance of sacred duties by a man and a woman is known as Prajapatya marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) The giving in marriage of a maiden for a couple of cows is called Arsha marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) The giving in marriage of a maiden to an officiating priest in a sacrifice is called Daiva marriage.*\n\n*(\\*) The voluntary union of a maiden with her lover is called Gandharva marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) Giving a maiden after receiving plenty of wealth is termed Asura marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) The abduction of a maiden is called Rakshasa marriage.* \n\n*(\\*) The abduction of a maiden while she is asleep and in intoxication is called Paisacha marraige.* \n\n*Of these, the first four are ancestral customs of old and are valid on their being approved of by the father.* \n\n*The rest (Arsha, Asura) are to be sanctioned by both the father and the mother, for:*\n\n*(\\*) It is they that receive the price paid by the bridegroom for their daughter.* \n\n*(\\*) In case of the absence by death of either the father or the mother, the survivor will receive the price.* \n\n*(\\*) If both of them are dead, the maiden herself shall receive it.* \n\n*Any kind of marriage is approvable if it pleases all those who are concerned in it.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 3.2:1-13\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPrincess Yashomati was usually well-spoken and confident in conversation – among her attendants and her other female friends, as well as with her father’s friends and guests. After all, she was a daughter of the mighty king Purushottama, and could be nothing short of perfection in every important way – what cause, then, was there for shyness? \n\nUntil she heard the message on her door: *The Great King Purushottama has offered your hand in marriage to the learned Brahmin, Chanakya Vishnugupta of Taxila – your suitor wishes to meet you, and you have been summoned to attend the courtroom within the hour for this purpose.*\n\nChanakya! \n\nThat mysterious young upstart, whom so many girls crafted statues of in their rooms, saying among themselves – but never in public, should they offend their future non-imaginary suitors – that they had accepted him as their husband, and play-fighting over who would be his principal wife. Cunning, eloquent Chanakya – who had for so many years been a forbidden fruit, for she had lived her entire life hearing her father complain jealously about the prosperity of the Gandharas and curse them as *wicked, traitorous Shakunis* even as he acted per the commands of ministers who were educated among these very Shakunis.\n\nShe had only once caught a glimpse of Chanakya at a debate, when he had been very young – and never had she considered that she would one day become the wife of this very Chanakya – now fully grown.\n\nHer heart racing, Yashomati lifted the veil, and slowly inched her eyes to meet Chanakya’s far stoicer ones.\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“*Arya*,” she said in a voice soft and feminine, “It is an honour to meet you.”\n\nChanakya nodded simply. “It is. But I have no fondness for flattery, and there is much of importance that we must speak about.”\n\nThe princess was petrified.\n\n“Many maidens have romantic daydreams about their wedding and subsequent marital life,” said the Professor. “Are you afflicted as such?”\n\nThe precise question shook Yashomati out of her bashfulness – it gave her a topic to speak about, independently of whom she was speaking with, allowed her to ignore her feelings for Chanakya, forgo those feelings of inadequacy, and simply *talk*, about a topic, *whatever topic*.\n\n“I have often dreamed of having an intellectual *swayamvara \\[3\\]*,” she said rushedly, “To ask my suitors questions of philosophy that intrigue me, to assess their intellectual calibre—”\n\nChanakya raised an eyebrow.\n\n“—but of course, with you that will not be necessary.” Yashomati imperceptibly batted her eyelashes.\n\n“What I meant is, are you aware that the cause of our marriage is primarily political?”\n\nYashomati was concerned by this, but was visibly calmer now.\n\n“What do you mean, precisely?”\n\n“Your father suspects that I am sympathetic or even loyal to the Greeks – that my actions may all be part of a ploy to benefit them – and that this is caused by my former companionship with a Greek immigrant girl in Taxila many years ago. My motivations are of course far too complicated to be explained by terms such as *loyalty*; nonetheless, your father believes that your marriage to me will eliminate any such ties, and will strengthen my loyalty to his sovereignty, which will allow him to accept the advice I give him without fear of conspiracy.”\n\nYashomati said nothing, and considered this.\n\n“Second,” said Chanakya, “Why are *you* willing to enter this marriage? Would you simply marry any man your father told you to?”\n\n(Purushottama would later be confused as to why Chanakya would ask his daughter this question – surely, the renown scholar held his ambitions and plots much higher than the precise volitions of one woman, even if she was to become his wife. But the Minister realized: Chanakya wished to signal to the king that he took such marital ties seriously, so as to not give the king cause to resist the Professor’s advice out of continued suspicion after the wedding.) \n\nThe princess thought carefully.\n\n“*Arya*,” she said in a measured tone, “I know that you are not fond of flattery, but I expect that as a Brahmin, you are fond of the truth. I understand that you tend to concern yourself with practical matters, and thus the practical motivations for marriage – political alliance, producing children, and so on. But there is also an emotional basis for a chaste relationship between a man and a woman, and it is thus: a man wishes to be respected by his wife for his capacities and accomplishments, and admire her for her virtues and beauty; a woman wishes to be admired by her husband for her virtues and beauty, and respect him for his capacities and accomplishments. And there is no man I respect more than you, *Arya*, there is no man – not in the three worlds – more accomplished than you, with greater intellect and ambition and capacity for achievement.”\n\nA brief look of admiration crossed Chanakya’s stoic face, in response to that eloquently-phrased sentence.\n\n“In that case,” said the revered scholar in a tone that suggested he was testing his prospective bride, “There are many in the world who are not worthy of marriage – men who lack capacities and accomplishment, and women who lack virtues and beauty – but they marry anyway, for practical purposes like sensual pleasures and producing children. What do you say of them, then?”\n\n“That they are forced to lie for each other’s delusional pleasures. But I need not be concerned with them. I have put an effort to adopting such feminine virtues as chastity, artistic talents, fitness, conversational skills, handling and teaching of children, making charming expressions with my eyes, reading of moods, and the ability to empathize with and understand a man. I do not claim that I am the most virtuous or most beautiful of women – but I do claim that as a result of my efforts, I can wish, without delusion, for the affections of a man as revered as yourself.”\n\nShe had answered as she was certain (from what she knew of Chanakya) would have scored the highest, had this been a test – perhaps with the exception of the flattery at the end – so a more ordinary man would have told her: *you are wise beyond your years* – but instead, Chanakya said (recognizing that that would have been false, for someone beyond her years would not have bothered so much with romance to conceive of it so theoretically):\n\n“You possess all the wisdom of your years, Princess. I accept you as my bride.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Women have hunger two-fold, shyness four-fold, daring six-fold, and lust eight-fold as compared to men.*\n\n—Kautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“What have you done, Professor!” \n\nKing Ambhi had listened. \n\nWhen Chanakya had stated his bizarre plan to cause his own prince to rebel against him, King Ambhi had listened; when Chanakya had instructed him to send risky letters to the Persians, King Ambhi had listened; when Chanakya had requested that he agreed to share the liberated Kamboja territory with a certain Queen Kripa, he had listened; when Chanakya had advised an unconditional surrender to the Greeks, King Ambhi had listened, and when Chanakya had asked him to ignore certain anti-Greek activities underway in his country, King Ambhi had listened.\n\nBut to be asked to join hands in friendship with Purushottama – Gandhara’s rival for generations – was simply *audacious*.\n\n“Professor Chanakya. My family and his have a historic enmity. *What have you done?*”\n\n“*Removed that historic rivalry*,” stated Chanakya. \n\n“Because it was an impediment to your plans?”\n\n“*Yes*. And once I am through with my plans, both you and King Purushottama will be great beneficiaries.”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“… what *are* your plans, Professor?”\n\n“Revealing my plans carelessly will not help me advance them. But you are an honest and competent man, as is King Purushottama, and I do not betray my word to honest and competent men. I request you to trust my intellect.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*\\[Alexander\\] kept on sending others in succession; and last of all Meroes (Maurya) an Indian, because he ascertained that he was an old friend of Porus.*\n\n—Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri 5.18\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nStaring at the young conqueror, the gathered courtiers murmured among themselves.\n\n“Why does he show his thighs so openly?” whispered one.\n\n“She is an apsara \\[4\\]!” said another, “But her hair is white – she is surely too old to still be dancing, but perhaps financial circumstances—”\n\n“Fool! That is not a woman – that is Alexander! The Greeks have white hair in their youth.”\n\n“That is not true – I have met a Greek before, he did not have such an odd appearance.”\n\n“Indeed – the males among the Greeks cut their hair short – this must be a woman!”\n\n“No, they don’t! If they cut their hair short, how would they survive a blow to the head?”\n\n“Well, obviously, their brains are located in their thighs!”\n\n“But their thighs are exposed too!”\n\nAlexander would have been quite annoyed, if he had understood the language of the Indians. \n\n*“King of Macedon. Autocrat of Greece. Pharaoh of Egypt. King of Persia. Lord of Asia. A greater hero than such as Heracles, a greater conqueror than such as Dionysus and Cyrus, may he reign for longer even than King Minos did – Alexander, son of Zeus!”*\n\nGiving a regal acknowledgement to the announcement of his epithets by his bards and beaming at his two greatest Indian allies – Omphis (*Ambhi*) and Porus (*Purushottama*) – he announced:\n\n“This is a historic moment indeed – the union of two ancient enemies in alliance, defying the prophecies of advisors and seers alike, a feat that could be achieved by none but the son of Zeus!”\n\nBut even the great Alexander – who possessed so many accomplishments to his name – felt the slightest pang of insecurity, for he had heard rumour, that the alliance he had wished to take credit for was not truly his work, but that of a certain mysterious Meroes (*Maurya*). Who was this Meroes – what were his motivations – and what means did he use for such persuasion? Certainly, Purushottama and Ambhi swore that they had not spoken to any such Meroes, and that they were entering this alliance by their own volition – and these stories about Meroes (it was a seal, apparently? – bearing the icon of the peacock, that bird Alexander had learned of in Babylon) and the nature of his intervention were so vague and miraculous, it hardly appeared sane for Alexander to give it care, as god-fearing as he was.\n\nSomewhere far removed from the site where this alliance was being forged, another alliance – more sacred and more eternal, yet linked to this one – underwent officiation.\n\nIn this barren stretch, with the Chief Minister of Purushottama’s as the only guest so as to maintain secrecy from the rest of the world – a man and a woman, Chanakya and Yashomati, circumambulated the holy fire.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*You learned people assembled at this sacred ceremony know it for certain that we two hereby accept each other as companions for life and agree to live together most cordially as husband and wife. May the hearts of us both be blended and beat in unison. May we love each other like the very breath of our lives. As the all-pervading God sustains the universe, so may we sustain each other. As a Professor loves his student, so may we love each other steadfastly and faithfully.* \n\n*Distant though we were, one from the other, we stand now united. May we be of one mind and spirit!

Yet, propagandists were successful at giving this a political agenda angle. \n2)death sentence to the 38 accused terrorists, again it was twisted, as if the Indian govt is plotting genocide against muslims. \n\nThe fact is, our image is already tarnished by leftist propagandist. Even if, a Hindu gets killed by bunch of Muslim goons, propagandist would never leave a stone unturned to make us, look like the oppressor. \n\nWho is manipulating the average muslim to kill a Hindu over sharing memes or reacting to memes?  The maulvis? What measures can be done to stop these manipulators? Control of social media or the maulvis being recruited? \n\nWhy do most people here think Rana Ayyub has good network with the west, hence she\'s successful to spread the propaganda? \nWhy is it not possible that West is using Rana Ayyub merely as another pawn, to peddle their agenda? Remember, if everyone is a terrorist, then no one is a terrorist. It\'s an open secret, that West is responsible for the menace in the middle east, now Hindus are being used as a scapegoat to switch the world\'s focus from the middle east to India. \n\n\nAbove all, whatever may be the cause. Clearly, things aren\'t in our control. So, what is in our control? What can be the probable solution?\n\n1) having a unified identity\n2) use this as an advantage to "manipulate" your relatives or kins who discriminate someone based on caste or language, make them realise, because of these bigger dents within our community, outsiders have always taken advantage, since time immemorial.\n3) develop a sense of smaller communities and stay connected with other smaller communities, as much as possible and encourage, support the underprivileged.  Remember, in the end, it\'s about who has more power. Our unified community, should always aim to be dominant. So, enhance your skills, pass it to the underprivileged or help other NGOs who are working for underprivileged people.\n Before starting my PhD in pure maths, I always took my time out and helped few kids from slums with maths, i also fund couple of them, who are very intelligent and motivated to study. \n4) because of trust issues, try to be less dependent outside your unified community as possible, eg- encourage more people to pass the jhatka tradition or go vegetarian. \n5) stay incognito, be a listener and not a reactor. Most of the problems intensified, because we pay unnecessary attention to the propagandists, let them bark. Unless, it\'s a necessity, we shouldn\'t react.'<br />Author: 'corvuskauva'  id: 'sygjaw'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sygjaw/my_opinion_and_possible_solution_wrt_to_the/</li>

Let me clear that every non-Muslim student here is allowed to not say the English translation of a Surah from Quran if they want. But many actually say and here my friend itself hate a chicken piece even though he is a full vegetarian. People are developing everywhere, and Indian's want to still stick to MUSLIM vs HINDU?\n\nGrow up, education about religion must be given to every student from smaller grades so this does not ever happen about hating on religion beliefs.\n\nAnd yes this just my opinion, you can hate Muslim's still but the world is knowing the reality now.

      <li>Title::: "Washington Post and UN Twitter posting about Rana Ayyub should be taken seriously and here's what we can learn from the debacle."<br />Body: "Rana as we all know is as credible as a journalist as VIjay Mallya is to an ethical businessman. In the recent times she's been called out by Saudis, has went on multiple news channels to call Hindus 'terrorists' and most importantly has been accused of a 1.7 cr scam in the name of 'covid relief'.\n\n\n\nThough the thing she has done so well is maintain her PR amongst the libbus to the point that they'll defend her to any length. This is the power of cummulative compulsive lies by psychopaths who only want personal gain out of everything. The problem with the Indic wing is simple: They're too nice, they don't want to lie and play 'dirty politics' which has been their downfall. This is why someone who wrote a book of fake accounts is being called for a BBC interview rather than a credible journo like Anand Ranganathan who dare I say is a way more eloquent as a speaker and puts across his points in a much better way, but that's where Rana has played the game so well. There's just one thing that the Indic wing lacks that these snakes don't: The power of networking.\n\n\nRana knows all the right people to get whatever narrative she wants. Ask yourself, who would your run of the mill person listen to? Someone who's credible. She knows the credible people and can pull her strings whicheveri way she wants to twist the narrative in her favour. Imagine if we could do the same with Hasan Minhaj and John Oliver, and they'd do shows about the 1971 war and the migrant crisis which lead to CAA instead of a 30 minute equivalence of Hindus to Nazis. We got no one, and we need allies to present the fact. \n\n\nWhenever I write posts like these I always hear the same thing 'Who cares about gora validation?' It's NOT about the validation. It's about gaining allies and people lining up to your side rather than going with what's 'there in the popular news'. I urge you all to contact the right people with proper links and data. Mail them and let them know what they're publishing is wrong. I see no one battling facts with facts.\n\n\n\nIf one doesn't understand the long political game and keep on doing the same thing, there will be a thousand Harshas and you'll keep making memes or fighting on twitter.\n\n\nThere's a reason why https://www.justiceforall.org/ comes as the first result whenever someone searches for 'justice' these days. These people KNOW the Social Media game way better than us. We have to take back control before it's too late.\n\n\nPeace!"<br />Author: 'for_acadamia'  id: 'syf3e6'<br />Score:143<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/syf3e6/washington_post_and_un_twitter_posting_about_rana/</li>

Om Shanti.\n\n"SMASH BRAHMINICAL PATRIARCHYYY!, shouts a 35-year-old PhD student at Jadavpur University who has spent the past 5 years studying "Transphobia in middle-age Roman literature" while all her friends moved on to work in financially stable careers after their bachelors and are all probably married by now.\n\nHaving no prospects for a normal career or financial stability, she and many others in her position latch on to these luxury beliefs to cope. Well, after all since they went to DU and did a PhD, their opinion should matter more than an average IT worker who just did a B Tech. They must hate everything which a common man believes in — traditional family structures, religion, culture, festivals, and so on. And they MUST take an opposite, anti-majority stance even if the majority is right.\n\nLuxury beliefs is a concept proposed by sociologist Rob Henderson. I will quote directly from his [article](https://nypost.com/2019/08/17/luxury-beliefs-are-the-latest-status-symbol-for-rich-americans/):\n\n&gt;In the past, upper-class Americans used to display their social status with luxury goods. Today, they do it with luxury beliefs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another luxury belief is that religion is irrational or harmful.  Members of the upper class are most likely to be atheists or non-religious. But they have the resources and access to thrive without the unifying social edifice of religion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Places of worship are often essential for the social fabric of poor communities. Denigrating the importance of religion harms the poor.  While affluent people often find meaning in their work, most Americans  do not have the luxury of a “profession.” They have jobs. They clock in,  they clock out. Without a family or community to care for, such a job can feel meaningless.\n\n[Elite overproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_overproduction) is another such concept theorized by anthropologist Peter Turchin.   \n\n\n&gt;It describes the condition of a society which is producing too many  potential elite-members relative to its ability to absorb them into the power structure. This, he hypothesizes, is a cause for social instability, as those left out of power feel aggrieved by their relatively low socioeconomic status.\n\nIn the past, studying in an English medium school and going to university almost guaranteed you a job and a middle to an upper-middle-class life. As times change and university degrees and English education gets more accessible, liberal elites with a superiority complex who made speaking fluent, illustrious English their whole identity (yes, Shashi, you), no longer feel special. As the Internet democratises knowledge, "historians" and "academics" are losing the monopoly on the right to create narratives. Amidst this scenario, the average subaltern Hindu, whose voice was suppressed by elitist op-ed writers and columnists is enjoying newfound freedom to share his point of view. And this is making a lot of elites uncomfortable.\n\n**So, don\'t be surprised if liberals find it "uncool" to support Hindu causes. Empathise with them and let them cope. :)**'<br />Author: 'est-1873'  id: 'sxz8hd'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sxz8hd/luxury_beliefs_the_coping_mechanism_of_modern/</li>

If this keeps happening like this we will destroy our culture, religion, tradition soon! can anyone **please give any good news** about this matter that our tradition, culture and everything will stay alive and not get destroyed by Jihadis?  \n\n\nTL;DR: 5 Hindus have been killed, and more will die as we are not taking strong stand against this, now people are making fun of Hindus following their culture, teenagers think of this as boring things; can we really survive with our own people not supporting + jihadis against us?\n\n***Embrace culture, tradition, religion and reject wokeism!***'<br />Author: 'kakunkaa'  id: 'sxx14a'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sxx14a/killing_of_hindus_but_we_will_not_do_anything/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Diary Of A True Follower'<br />Body: "Taufiq was a cruel man. He is known to be unjust and of bad character. We have waged a war against him for long and he has been our most bitter rival. It all started with him burning the slaves who refused to eat their dead. Its our duty to rid the world of such evil.\n\n--x--\n\nThe bitter struggle between us and Taufiq continues. His side is weakening day by day. They are not so weak as to be conquored anytime soon but the moment of their defeat awaits inevitably.\n\n--x--\n\nThere are talks of peace. There are hints of him being repentant and he looks up to our great master for forgiveness. Our master is kind and forgiving. The other day I asked the great master whether we should forgive Taufiq and his comrades and he said forgivness is the greatest virtue but if we wish otherwise we should tell him and he would consider it again. This is the humility of our great master, he knows better than all of us and yet he is modest and ready to reconsider his own views for our shallow doubts.\n\n--x--\n\nOur master has spoken. Peace is always better than war. Forgivness better than revenge. And so we forgive our enemies and the bygone will be bygone. I have sinned that day by contradicting the great master, even if its just in my mind. That day when master spoke of forgiveness my mind asked, “forgiveness is better than revenge no doubt but is forgiveness also better than justice? Would it not be just to rid the world of evil? Is repentance sometimes not just a shield to deflect justice? But I shrugged these thoughts and begged the almighty to forgive my sin of doubting the wise master, the master that all mighty has sent to us as a blessing and a gift.\n\n--x--\n\nThe war is over. We have won. Both sides have won. Taufiq has been accepted in the grace of the lord. He has accepted the Supremacy of the almighty and his messanger our wise master. Taufiq has been forgiven and we all know how able he is. He was formidable as an enemy but he inspire so much confidence as an ally. Taufiq has been given high post. It would inspire confidence in our new allies. Our forces have grown. Together our forces are unparalleled. Our flag is the highest.\n\n--x--\n\nTaufiq had their hands chopped off. Those were some thieves they say. I thought of it as being too severe. I suspected Taufiq derived a hidden sadistic pleasure from this act of cruelty. May be I am being bitter, I have to learn to forgive from heart. I dont know why but his act feels like an act of rebellion against us, against our wise master. Why do I feel this way? This is the feeling of hearing your enemy blowing the war horn. The act cannot be described as such but i cannot escape this feeling. The wise master was silent on the act, he is in union with the almighty most of the time now and rarely comes out of the cave.\n\n--x--\n\nWise master is bedridden since several days. We take care of him. Taufiq looks after the day to day affairs and he along with his few comrades have kept institutions functional and maintain law &amp; order while we who have been close to the master stay with him the whole day taking caring of him, being always there. Servants could have done this but we are the servants of our great master.\n\n--x--\n\nTaufiq has burnt some slaves alive. This is not the time to think or react to such things, our wise master is in the grip of ailments. He has stopped eating and speaking. The gloom has set in as a precursor of something people do not want to name.\n\n--x--\n\nOur wise master, peace be upon him, has left us and chaos has taken over. The war is on again. Taufiq claim to have inherited the will and spirit of wise master and declared himself the new wise master and ruler divinely sanctioned by the almighty, he says he is fulfilling this role since the master was alive and with his sanction. He says wise master gave him the duty to rule govern while he was alive and that's what he has been doing since then.\n\nTaufiq and his followers did not even let us bury master’s body for days, his mortal remains started to rot. It was more important for them to go after every member of the master’s family. We could have fought and died but it was more important to save master’s family. We fled to assemble and fight again.\n\n--x--\n\nIn the last few months one city after another have fallen to Taufiq’s forces. Can’t believe people are falling for his lies and consider him master’s successor in role of the “new wise master”. A few of our old comrades have sided with him. Sooner or later they will realize their folly and we will win.\n\n--x--\nPlease give feedback on how you liked the story.

      <li>Title::: "No Matter How Many 'Facts' and 'Figures' You Bring In, You'll Always Lose The Argument And Here's Why."<br />Body: "Because supporting Hindus isn't 'Cool'. There I said it. There is no control you have over the youth's voice, no matter how 'right' you are they'll only listen to someone who they follow or who makes the most sense to them. Every single influencer or popular person you see will never support your cause. That's the truth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing liberal is a social status thing now, and I have no clue why we don't embrace taking the label. Take it away from Islamists because they're benefitting from being the 'enemy of the enemy', turning it over and coming up with bullshit excuses to support their cause. Hinduism is historically the biggest supporter of the LGBTQ cause but it's been reduced to the enemy why? Because we're the 'right'. So to begin with let's erase the 'left wing right wing' thing. The real right in the country is the islamist extremists, we're the center. And that's that, unless you don't take it in your hands we will still keep failing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe focus therefore shouldn't be to bring facts and figures cause that'll do nothing but distance you from them, because they'll view you as bigots, the focus should be on making it 'cool again' where supporting Hindus and opposing Muslims isn't 'cancellable'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeat them at their own game. An example would be turning the common M folk against their own, the way the Commie leaders have done so well, and I'm not talking about the caste divide. The whole Hijab issue was a beautiful opportunity of showcasing just that, you could have showcased leaders like Rana and other M folks as bigots pushing the M community back and being against their education but it all became yet another H vs M battle which we will ALWAYS lose. This is why you will see people in the 21st century supporting hijab in India not because it doesn't make sense to you, but because it comes under the package of 'women can do and wear whatever they want' and not under the 'islam bracket'. It was a beautiful opportunity for us to come up with mainstream terms like they have (Ashrafian patriarchy etc.) that could actually make us beat the odds but alas we're still in the same boat. We're the terrorists who haven't touched a person, and they're the victims who've killed and attacked people left and right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if you say 'their opinion doesn't matter' you have no clue about politics. The righteous don't always win, you can be good all your life but someone who's politically well equipped and knows how to win arguments can make you be percieved as the biggest evil that ever walked on earth and when that happens anything that happens to you will be 'justified' and 'God's will'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would highly urge you all to read '48 laws of power' and '33 strategies of war' to get an idea of how to win this longer battle. It breaks my heart to see yet another Hindu die in the hands of extremists and no one talking about it. The only way you'll get them to talk about it is to make it worth their while. We can still take back control, it's only a matter of playing the game right."<br />Author: 'for_acadamia'  id: 'sxkeh8'<br />Score:132<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sxkeh8/no_matter_how_many_facts_and_figures_you_bring_in/</li>

How long until this devolves into pornography and is openly displayed on screens across the nation? What about the children?\n\nI understand that the Reddit population overwhelmingly belongs to the complacent subset of people I mentioned earlier and I don't mind the downvotes that will undoubtedly be sent by them.

Here\'s my quick takeaway on it.\n\n# Good - \n\nThe respect ppl give with folded hands, etc humble giants. I truly enjoyed watching this Soul of India on national tv, a change from the circus we are used to. \n\n# Bad - \n\nNon sophisticated deals, sabji mandi type stuff bidding wars, some sharks talking down to ppl and/or in tu-tadak, chapri language.\n\n\\*perhaps this will change in coming seasons, and my views might be colored due to the american show. However elitist this may sound, the usual defense given is "this is indian show, we like drama". Well, it\'s like paisa aya but class nahi aya.\n\n# Final observations -\n\n* I hope this show will act as a cultural cue and signal that not all is doom and gloom. Personally, I ended up feeling hopeful at the end of the show. \n* The manufactured othering of folks from the north by discouraging hindi language in the South of India, will with time, to some extent, vanish hopefully. (many ppl struggled with the language on the show)\n* This is still the surface level stuff we see, at the backend there is much work to do - organising sectors, cutting red-tape, corruption, judicial recourse etc etc. \n\n# Interesting companies (in no particular order):\n\n1. Indian hemp co - hemp products. Seems interesting, might try it.\n2. Morriko - loved the respect shown to gujjus overall on the show. There was this old world gujju kaka charm with that elderly gentleman. Maybe some of you missed this joke in the background when they were giving out samples; the pharma lady says "how did you know I\'d like this flavour", the older gentleman says, "ladkiyo ko ye pasand hai" (it was a sour taste)\n3. Beyond Snacks - the kerala banana chips guy. \n4. Peechute - disposable emergency pee product (turns into solid). This will be a wild success I think.\n5. Bamboo India - bamboo products + toothbrush, wanna try this out too perhaps.\n\nThoughts?'<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'sx5kux'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sx5kux/shark_tank_india_season_1_my_takeaway/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is Personal Finance [PART 1}'<br />Body: "Hello,\n\nI have thought of creating a few parts of the Personal Finance thread. This is not by moderators. This is by my own accord.\n\nAs I am writing this for the first time, please help me to provide useful feedback and do tell me what do you want to me to write.\n\nMy part 1 is on the basics for Personal Finance and then part 2 is for budgeting. So let's begin.\n\n# What is Personal Finance?\n\nSo basically, personal finance refers to how an individual manages his/her finances. Financial management is a skill which takes time to master. ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp))\n\nAs personal finance is a big topic, this will be broken up into different parts. This first part we will discuss about net worth and net cash flow. \n\nMany a times, people expressed their concern on their individual’s finances.\n\nLet’s go in depth into how to manage their expenses.\n\nSome of the key terms you might want to know are as follows:\n\n# Net Worth\n\nAssets (Things that you own)\n\nLiabilities (Things you owe or someone owes you)\n\nA person’s net worth is determined by the following equation:\n\nNet Worth = Assets – Liabilities.\n\n# Net Cash Flow\n\nAnother one is net cash flow:\n\nNet Cash Flow = Income – Expenditure.\n\nNet Cash Flow is to see how much of your money is being spent on. Basically for every Rs 1 you earn, how much of that Rs 1 you spend.\n\nIf you earn Rs 50,000 and spend Rs 25,000, then you have a cash surplus of Rs 25,000.\n\nIf you earn Rs 50,000 and spend Rs 79,000, then you have a cash deficit of negative Rs 29,000. If this is so, you need to see where you should cut down (Next section – Budgeting will cover this)\n\nYour income includes the investment income like dividends on shares and take home pay. \n\nExpenditure is normal day to day items like sabzi and groceries.\n\n# What are some of the items that fall under assets?\n\nAssets can be classified as current and non-current assets.\n\nCurrent assets can be your cash for 12 months. That means current asset is equal to or less than 1 year (12 months)\n\nNon-Current Assets can be your house and car (unless you’re too rich to buy and sell every year)\n\nLiabilities?\n\nCurrent liabilities can be your cash for 12 months. That means current liabilities is equal to or less than 1 year (12 months)\n\nNon-Current liabilities can be long term loans like 5 to 10 years loan from the bank or 2 years from your friend (Kuch bhi hota hai na?)\n\nAt any point of your life, you should not have liabilities exceeding your assets. That means your liabilities should not be more than assets. If liabilities are more than assets, it’s a mayday. That’s why you should start investing when you are young so that in case you are trapped you can dip into the reserves.\n\nAnother key term is emergency fund. This fund should last you 3 to 6 months. The higher the amount, the better it is. This emergency fund can be like your reserves. Life is so uncertain that you do not know what will happen next. Therefore, this can be a cushion for your finances.\n\nWith this, I hope you understand what is Assets, Liabilities, Capital, Net Worth and Net Cash Flow.\n\nThis is Part 1. In next one, I will talk about Budgeting.\n\nIf you would want to know more about net cash flow and net worth or want to know how to draw up, I will put up an Excel sheet below.\n\nThank you."<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'sx1b5t'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sx1b5t/what_is_personal_finance_part_1/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Rise and Fall of Indian FMCG Companies - Nirma , Torino , Limca, Thums up and Gold Spot'<br />Body: "In 1969, Dr Karsanbhai Patel, a chemist and lab technician in Gujarat, began making a homemade detergent product that he distributed to people on his way to work. It was not harsh on clothes and was much less costly than Surf, the dominant detergent in the market.\n\nAs people began liking it, Patel began manufacturing it on a much larger scale. He started the packaging in a 10×10 feet room in his house, and named the detergent powder Nirma, after his daughter Nirupama. The girl in the white dress on the packaging was inspired by his daughter.\n\nTheir marketing was top notch in the early 90s when they made ads with catchy tunes which even kids used rhyme at schools,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It’s simplicity is what made the jingle memorable — through various iterations of the advertisement, the phrase ‘washing powder Nirma’, repeated twice, has given it a high recall value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/in.pinterest.com\\/pin\\/771171136168750549\\/](https://preview.redd.it/14q6ljx4cyi81.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fd740a8cb6c1887f688215079ca5ec53867d02f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNirma was founded when a chemist from Gujarat, Karsanbhai Patel manufactured a phosphate-free detergent in his backyard and started selling it locally. That time, Surf (a product of HUL), the Pioneer of Detergents, had priced its product at Rs.15 per Kg. The door-to-door campaigns for Nirma in 1969 were very well-timed. By coordinating and streamlining activities such as production, distribution, and marketing, Patel was able to sell Nirma at Rs. 3.5 per kg.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Fall\n\nInspite of such a good start it fell off the cliff, several reasons\n\n* Nirma spent a meager 3-4% of its revenue on Marketing communications (Ad-campaigns) while other competing brands spent 6-8% on advertising.\n* The rival brands have products across all price ranges to mitigate the input cost effect, but Nirma is available in only one category—value for money. This has proved disadvantageous for the brand\n* Consumers began to perceive Nirma as an inferior brand due to its low price\n\nWhile their marketing was top notch in the early 90s when they made ads with catchy tunes which even kids used rhyme at schools, they somehow missed the bus at the later stages\n\nThere are many such Indian companies which did so well in the 80s/90s and competed with established FMCG companies from the west. Here Nirma took on the Hindustan Lever Limited. By 1998 Nirma  had around 60% market share by then, selling more than 1.72 lakh tonnes taking off the major shares off from Surf (HUL)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where does Nirma stand now**\n\nIn November 2007, Nirma purchased American raw materials company Searles Valley Minerals Inc., making it among the top seven soda ash manufacturers in the world.\n\nNirma Group started cement manufacturing in 2014 from a single plant in Nimbol. In 2016, Nirma acquired Lafarge India's cement assets for $1.4 billion. In February 2020, Nirma acquired Emami Cement for ₹5,500 crore (US$730 million)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Story of Soft drinks\n\nThums Up was created in 1977, after the American company Coca-Cola withdrew from India, due to regulations requiring it to disclose its formula and sell 60% of its equity to an Indian company under a government plan for foreign-owned companies to share stakes with domestic partners.\n\nThe Chauhan brothers owned part of the Parle company and already had two other brands of soda, Limca and Gold Spot, which were popular in India at the time. Thums Up quickly became the most popular and achieved a near monopoly among cola products in India during the 1980s, such as Campa Cola, Double Seven, Dukes and United Breweries Group's McDowell's Crush.\n\nRamesh Chauhan had developed the formula from scratch, experimenting with ingredients such as cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. The company also wanted the drink to be fizzy, even when it was not ice-cold, so it could be sold by vendors. After much testing and experimentation, the Chauhan brothers and their research team created a cola that was fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola. They originally planned to name the drink “Thumbs Up,” but removed the “b” to make the name unique.\n\nIn 1991, when the Indian government opened the market to multinationals, Pepsi was the first to come in. Thums Up and Pepsi subsequently engaged in heavy competition for endorsements. Pepsi advertisements included major Indian movie stars like Juhi Chawla, while Thums Up increased its spending on cricket sponsorship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zersewaiyi81.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036862e98be5db2df5b126c0aaa41775076f8b72\n\n# In 1993, Coca-Cola re-entered the market, and the three companies competed intensely. Later in the year, Coca-Cola bought the Parle-owned drinks Gold Spot, Limca and Thums Up for $60 million. When these were sold to Coca-Cola, Thums Up had a market share of 85 percent in India\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aoehz0k1iyi81.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=057ccf5cd12f12b5f26b41c4d81ddc9319ba0459\n\nOne is selling it for just $60 million but another thing is giving up on your hardwork of establishing a 85% market share.  This is another example of how most Indian companies concentrated mainly on local market, there was not much done to make it export oriented even a regional player lets say in Asia like in Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , Nepal etc\n\nWhere does Parle stand now in 2019, it had a 7% share of the global biscuit market, growing to 50% by 2020. As of 2020, as per Nielsen, it is the largest selling biscuit brand in the world \n\n# Torino\n\nI think many in the South would remember this cool drink brand , also called as Color in Tamil Nadu\n\nIn 1977, as Coca-Cola was beating a retreat from India under the  provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, Torino, an orange  soda with a prodigious use of sugar, entered the market in south India.  \n\n“In no time, we had captured 90 per cent of Karnataka’s orange soda  market,” says Pankaj Lakhani, the second-generation owner and MD of  Bangalore Soft Drinks. Torino has since been re-launched in PET bottles  across Karnataka, where it has over 60 distributors, and Tamil Nadu,  where doctors still recommend it as a high-calorie fluid in summer.\n\n[**Chiyaan Vikram in Torino Cooldrink Ad old | CVF**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkTUeSTkfbo&amp;ab_channel=ChiyaanVikram)\n\nDo you know any other Indian company that fell off a cliff ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[*https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/opinion-entertainment/indian-ad-age-how-a-jingle-made-nirma-sabki-pasand-6145078/*](https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/opinion-entertainment/indian-ad-age-how-a-jingle-made-nirma-sabki-pasand-6145078/)\n\n[*https://www.marketingweekly.in/post/the-rise-and-fall-of-nirma*](https://www.marketingweekly.in/post/the-rise-and-fall-of-nirma)\n\n[*https://theprint.in/features/brandma/washing-powder-nirma-washing-powder-nirma-a-simple-jingle-that-became-earworm-for-millions/772953/*](https://theprint.in/features/brandma/washing-powder-nirma-washing-powder-nirma-a-simple-jingle-that-became-earworm-for-millions/772953/)\n\n[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thums\\_Up*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thums_Up)\n\n[*https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/indias-homegrown-sodas-that-survived-despite-cola-wars/*](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/indias-homegrown-sodas-that-survived-despite-cola-wars/)"<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'swxhea'<br />Score:62<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/swxhea/the_rise_and_fall_of_indian_fmcg_companies_nirma/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL chickens may have first been domesticated by the Indus Valley Civilization'<br />Body: 'Some interesting history of India\'s most popular non-veg food item: the humble, flightless chicken. \n\n&gt;The chicken’s wild progenitor is the red junglefowl, *Gallus gallus*, according to a theory advanced by Charles Darwin and recently confirmed by DNA analysis. The bird’s resemblance to modern chickens is manifest in the male’s red wattles and comb, the spur he uses to fight and his cock-a-doodle-doo mating call. The dun-colored females brood eggs and cluck just like barnyard chickens. In its habitat, which stretches from northeastern India to the Philippines, *G. gallus* browses on the forest floor for insects, seeds and fruit, and flies up to nest in the trees at night. That’s about as much flying as it can manage, a trait that had obvious appeal to humans seeking to capture and raise it. \n\nSo the ancestor of the chicken was present in the Indian subcontinent. Moreover:\n\n&gt;Recent research suggests that modern chickens inherited at least one trait, their yellow skin, from the gray junglefowl of southern India. Did a domesticated breed of *G. gallus* spread initially from Southeast Asia, traveling either north to China or southwest to India? Or were there two separate heartlands of domestication: ancient India and Southeast Asia? \n\nThat\'s the history of the animal, but what about its contact with humans? Here\'s some surprising information:\n\n&gt;Although inconclusive, evidence suggests that ground zero for the bird’s westward spread may have been the Indus Valley, where the city-states of the Harappan civilization carried on a lively trade with the Middle East more than 4,000 years ago. Archaeologists have recovered chicken bones from Lothal, once a great port on the west coast of India, raising the possibility that the birds could have been carried across to the Arabian Peninsula as cargo or provisions. By 2000 B.C., cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia refer to “the bird of Meluhha,” the likely place name for the Indus Valley. That may or may not have been a chicken; Professor Piotr Steinkeller, a specialist in ancient Near Eastern texts at Harvard, says that it was certainly “some exotic bird that was unknown to Mesopotamia.” He believes that references to the “royal bird of Meluhha”—a phrase that shows up in texts three centuries later—most likely refer to the chicken. \n\nSome of you may have heard of the name "Meluha" for the Indus Valley Civilization in Amish Tripathi\'s Shiva trilogy. The thriving ancient trade between India, Africa, and Europe is of course well-known and well-documented: it is precisely this trade that made the subcontinent the richest place in the world (and why closing India off to global trade by Nehru was foolish, but that\'s for another day). Moreover, Romans, who were known to have emptied their gold treasuries to buy things from India (which is why we have so much gold in India today, despite producing next to nothing), apparently loved chickens too:\n\n&gt;Chickens were a delicacy among the Romans, whose culinary innovations included the omelet and the practice of stuffing birds for cooking, although their recipes tended more toward mashed chicken brains than bread crumbs.  \n\nAnd of course, as usual, the British were thieves that stole even the humble chicken from us and turning it into their so-called national dish, chicken tikka masala:\n\n&gt;The most frequently served dish in British restaurants, Cook said, was “a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.” The great event took place in the early 1970s in an Indian restaurant in Glasgow, according to a Scottish MP who urged the European Union to grant the dish a “protected designation of origin.” This did not sit well with chefs in New Delhi, one of whom described chicken tikka masala as “an authentic Mughlai recipe prepared by our forefathers who were royal chefs in the Mughal period,” which covered roughly the 16th through 18th centuries. \n\nSo for those of you that eat chicken (which is an overwhelming majority of Indians, BTW, veg supremacists notwithstanding), enjoy your next plate of chicken curry and rice with the satisfaction of knowing that this is yet another aspect of our Indus Valley Civilization that continues to this day!\n\nSource: [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/)'<br />Author: 'ididacannonball'  id: 'swsah7'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/swsah7/til_chickens_may_have_first_been_domesticated_by/</li>

No other non-consensual sexual activity is considered rape. No man can rape a man, no women can rape a man according to the law. If an underage boy and girl have intercourse consensually, then it is automatically considered rape (obviously girl is the victim). False accusations were 52% in 2013-14. Punishment for false accusations? Maximum 6 months jail or 1000 rupees fine. Do you know how trivial of a punishment that is for ruining someone’s life? The victim’s identity is never revealed but the accused’s identity is always revealed, even if the accusations are false. The women’s identity is still protected after the false accusation. A man cannot be a victim of domestic violence (married men commit suicides much more than married women). Only men be can punished for adultery in a marriage, if a woman commits adultery, it’s not a crime. Women cannot be charged for pa\\*dophilia. A wife is entitled to all of the husband’s money, husband is entitled to none of hers. Men are treated are as creatures with no dignity. Anti-Dowry laws are the most misused laws in the country. Only women can avail alimony (permanent). If the deceased has no will, the spouse, mother and children inherit the property belonging to the deceased. The father is only entitled if the deceased does not have a spouse, mother or children. A boy is entitled to maintenance only till he turns 18, whereas a girl is entitled to maintenance till she gets married. Under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956, it is the parents' responsibility to a girl child's maintenance till she decides to provide for herself or gets married. If a man has sex with a woman after promising marriage, he can't break up with the woman. If he does, according to the laws in India, he's a rapist, which means the man is trapped in that relationship, under no context (until she has committed some other crime herself, I am not sure on this thou) can he end it.\n\n \n\nThese are not even all of them. Does any else see that these are problematic? Do feminists care? Do men even care about it themselves?

      <li>Title::: '"I find it hard to believe that 1% Christians and 12% Muslims are threat to 87% Hindus and the religion. This defies logic. Are we as a country being misled? Hijab and other religious controversies do hint that."'<br />Body: "The above question was posted on one of the major subreddits recently. I didn't find the subreddit worthy of deserving a genuine answer. So here, trying to answer the above question with a pinch of common sense.\n\nFirst of all, there aren't 1% Christians nor 12% Muslims in India. According to the 2011 census, Christians constitute about 2.3% of the population and Muslims about 14.23% of population. For historical context, In 1951, 2.3% of the population was Christian whereas only 9.8% were Muslims. The 2022 census will reveal the correct numbers but it's quite clear that there has been a rapid and consistent change in percentage of Muslims in India especially when they claim that the state has been genociding them/ denying them justice since the inception.\n\nSo the question is are they a threat to Hindus? Well It would take me a lot of time to study this possibility for every state, So I will answer this question in context with one south Indian state which has been commended as the bastion of development, health, wealth, etc etc and a model state for whole India- Kerala. \n\nOne more reason for choosing Kerala is because it has never seen a BJP government, So one can't really do mental gymnastics to blame/credit BJP.\n\nKerala has 54% Hindus, 26% Muslims and 18% Christians.\n\nI would define first what exactly is a threat here. Threat is the systemic gradual wipe out of population. And I will prove how a neutral goodie-goodie pseudo-secular environment helps do that. Obviously I won't talk about the development in kerala, We recently saw their CM going to US for treatment. Migrants go to UAE and others go to Bangalore for a Job. They send remittances and the delusional folks keep circlejerking about how great Kerala is in everything. Well they can circlejerk about religious harmony resulting in 0 seats for BJP. However I find it quite funny that the Muslim League has won 15 seats in the recent elections.\n\nKerala, despite being a literal heaven in India, an epitome of secularity and intellectuals, has very large differences in behaviour by religion\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wuu0xvifcri81.jpg?width=1612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6fad6c8cd6bc15570dfc872234b93b081f3cfc\n\nfrom 1951 to 2011, Hindus have gone from 62% to 55% while others have grown quite significantly.\n\nWell people may say thats quite slow eradication. However this is the where the real shit starts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxrv1gyvcri81.jpg?width=1583&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2daccfec495b652e89376c0597632bfba988540f\n\nYes you see that right. Since 2015 the number of births of Muslims has officially exceeded Hindus. This means that the native population is set to be reduced to a minority very soon.\n\n [Kanthapuram flays ban on hijab on campuses - The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kanthapuram-flays-ban-on-hijab-on-campuses/article38389541.ece) Educated Kerala Muslims\n\nNot even going into the ISIS shit, this only tells that a pseudo secular environment is a direct threat to the indigineos population. Lahore/Sindh/Dhaka was not a Muslim Majority Region too long ago. If we ignore history we are bound to repeat it.

      <li>Title::: "Why can't we start our own YouTube? Why do we have to rely on Big Tech?"<br />Body: 'I wrote this as a comment under an OpIndia article. I\'m reproducing it here for better visibility.\n\nI\'m happy to see the OpIndia covering issues in Canada but disappointed they haven\'t stepped up their game. Islamists in UK and USA have been going after advertisers on OpIndia\'s website and threatening to \'expose\' and boycott them unless they stop advertising there. OpIndia has previously stated they do not care about such boycotts, and it\'s the donations from patriotic Indians (I\'m one of them) that matter the most.\n\n&gt;The head of the campaign, Richard Wilson, said that "OpIndia is becoming internationally notorious for its hateful and discriminatory coverage" and that the campaign has "rarely seen such overt advocacy of discrimination on religious grounds". Over 20 organisations,[24] including advertising network Rubicon Project, video streaming service Mubi, personal care brand Harry\'s and the Saïd Business School, ceased advertising on OpIndia as a result of the campaign. Sharma responded that she would "stand by our article and our content 100%" and that OpIndia would "never alter its core belief system or content".[37][53] Roushan stated that advertisements constitute a minority of OpIndia\'s revenue and claimed that OpIndia received a "700% jump" in donations during the campaign.[24]\n\nRecently during the Trucker Protests in Canada, GoFundMe received several million dollars in donations from Americans and Canadians. When the leftists cracked down on them GFM decided to redirect all collected donations to Marxist organisation Black Lives Matter. BLM is responsible for the 2020 riots in which a large number of African American-owned businesses were burned down by BLM rioters themselves. People also lost their lives. Their leader is on record saying that she\'s a \'[trained Marxist] (https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/)\'. Racism is bad and must be defeated but BLM is not the answer.\n\nWhen people initiated credit card chargebacks, they decided to refund the donations instead. With GFM out of the picture, an American site called GiveSendGo started collecting donations. They are a patriotic and Christian-owned organization. Leftist hackers stole their data and doxxed their donors list. Many Canadian business owners who donated became victims of physical attacks and vandalism. They also receive hate mail and may now be sued and jailed under Canada\'s Emergency laws.\n\nA few months ago, I wrote a [post] (https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qoixo2/twitter_is_censoring_opindia_i_think_its_high/) on this sub on why RW outlets like Republic and OpIndia must not solely rely on YouTube. Some countries like Malaysia have already blocked Republic\'s website, and I wouldn\'t be surprised if OpIndia is too. \n\nAltNews, a biased [anti India channel] (https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p8mywo/vijay_patel_dug_up_altnews_financials_turns_out/) has mirrored their videos on Odysee. Their are thousands of their videos on that site, helping to spread anti India sentiment and influence people\'s opinions. Foreign-based Khalistanis and Kashmiri separatists are also brainwashing Indians on YouTube and Odysee. The so-called freedom respecting countries like USA and Britain host these terrorists and allow them to bomb India and breed antinationals. In December, a Ludhiana courtroom was bombed and many people were wounded. What would the west do if Gujarat and Karnataka hosted terrorists from "Americans For Justice" (like SFJ) and helped them send drones and weapons to bomb London and Washington?\n\nJust like how GiveSendGo was hacked and their donors doxxed, the same could happen to OpIndia. \n\nJust like how OpIndia was temporarily banned from Twitter, the same could happen to their YouTube account. \n\nJust like how RW is losing the narrative, they will be wiped off the internet sans any explanation or justification.\n\nHundreds of fake accounts were created by Pakistan to create trouble during the so-called Hijab protests. One major act of violence and the whole region will have communal riots. At least 2 bombs have been found in Delhi in the past month and it\'s said they are linked to ISIS and Pakistan. If communal riots were to break out -- there\'s a very high chance of it -- the proponents of cancel culture will lobby for \'Islamophobic brainwashing genocide-enablers\' like Republic and Swarajya to be sanctioned and banned. \n\nTherefore I urge Indian media houses to not lose the battle for the narrative, they must adapt, improvise and survive if they want to remain in the game. Start a YouTube alternative. We have the demand and the skills to pull off such a feat. Stop relying on Twitter and YouTube, adopt a presence on other platforms. Enhance cybersecurity and hire professionals to better protect their site and its users.

      <li>Title::: 'Those equating hijab/burkha with pagdi are doing a disservice to female rights and paving the way for societal pressure to put Hindu &amp; Muslim women back behind purdah. Unlike hijab, pagdi was never used in malpractice to deny Sikh males liberty of movement or activity'<br />Body: 'Pardah or purdah (from Persian: پرده, meaning "curtain") is a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim and Hindu communities.[1] It takes two forms: physical segregation of the sexes and the requirement that women cover their bodies so as to cover their skin and conceal their form. A woman who practices purdah can be referred to as pardanashin or purdahnishan. The term purdah is sometimes applied to similar practices in other parts of the world.\n\nPhysical segregation within buildings is achieved with judicious use of walls, curtains, and screens. A woman\'s withdrawal into purdah usually restricts her personal, social and economic activities outside her home. The usual purdah garment worn is a burqa, which may or may not include a yashmak, a veil to conceal the face. The eyes may or may not be exposed.\n\nPurdah was rigorously observed under the Taliban in Afghanistan, where women had to observe complete purdah at all times when they were in public. Only close male family members and other women were allowed to see them out of purdah. In other societies, purdah is often only practised during certain times of religious significance.\n\nMarried Hindu women in parts of Northern India observe purdah, with some women wearing a ghoonghat in the presence of older male relations on their husbands\' side;[4] some Muslim women observe purdah through the wearing of a burqa\n\nMuslim rule of northern India during the Mughal Empire influenced the practice of Hinduism, and the purdah spread to the Hindu upper classes of northern India.[8] The spread of purdah outside of the Muslim community can be attributed to the tendency of affluent classes to mirror the societal practices of the nobility; poor women did not observe purdah. Lower-class women in small villages often worked in fields, and therefore could not afford to abandon their work to be secluded.[3] During the British colonial period in India, purdah observance was widespread and strictly adhered to among the Muslim minority.[\n\nThe following reminiscence from C.M. Naim describes the evolution of purdah during the first third of the 20th century among the sharif or genteel people of Avadh, United Provinces, British India:[16]\n\nThe word ‘Hijab\' is relatively new for me. It was not a part of my vocabulary as I was growing up. I learned it much later, when I began to read literary and religious Urdu texts. ... The relevant word that I learned growing up was purdah. And I learned the word and its many meanings in the observed practice of the various female members of my middle-class family in Bara Banki, a small town in north India.\n\nFor Ammi, my grandmother, purdah meant almost never venturing out of the house. On the rare occasions when she did, it was always an elaborate ritual. Visiting a family in the neighbourhood -- only on the occasion of some tragedy, ... she used a doli. The little stool slung from a pole that two men carried would be brought to our back door -- the door to the zanana or the ladies\' section -- and the two carriers would step away behind the curtain wall. Ammi would wrap herself in a white sheet and squat on the flat stool, and a heavy custom-made cover would be thrown over her and the doli. The two bearers would then come back and carry the doli away on their shoulders. ... When Ammi traveled in my father\'s car, she covered herself the same way, while the back seat of the car where she sat was made completely invisible by pieces of cloth hung across the windows.\n\nApa, my mother, belonged to the next generation. She used a burqa. Hers was a two piece ‘modern\' outfit, as opposed to the one-piece -- derisively called ‘the shuttlecock\' by my sisters -- that was preferred by the older or more conservatively spirited in the family. I also remember that the older generation\'s burqas were usually white, while the new burqas were always black.\n\nApa’s burqa’ consisted of a skirt and a separate top throw -- one that covered her from the head to the thighs. The two pieces allowed for easier movement of both arms and legs. The top had a separate veil hanging over the face, which Apa could throw back in the company of women, e.g. while traveling in the ladies compartment on a train, or hold partly aside to look at things more closely when she went shopping. Apa wore a burqa all her life, except of course when she went to Mecca for Hajj. There she wore the same sheets of ihram that Ammi had to were [sic] earlier. Like all women pilgrims then and now, she too exposed her face to everyone’s sight but not her hair.\n\n... I should not neglect to mention that in those days -- I’m talking about the Forties -- it was considered improper even for Hindu ladies of certain classes to be seen in public with their hair and faces uncovered, particularly the married women. They never wore a burqa -- that was for Muslims alone. Instead, they used a shawl, a plain white sheet, or the palloo of their saris to cover what was not for strangers to see. They too lived in houses that had separate women’s quarters. Their daughters traveled to school daily in a covered wagon that was pushed by two men, just like their Muslim counterparts. (The school was exclusively for girls and had a very high wall surrounding it.)\n\nA different form of veiling, the ghoonghat, is found among some married Hindu women in rural North India. A fold of the sari is drawn over the face when the woman is in the presence of older male in-laws or in a place where there is likelihood of meeting them, e.g. the in-laws\' village. It is not worn otherwise, for example, when visiting her mother\'s home or in a location far from the in-laws\' village. Hindu women in other parts of India—south, east, west (below Gujarat)—do not veil themselves.\n\nFor both Hindu and Muslim women in the eastern part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, having a "separate women\'s quarters within the house" is commonplace among families who can afford it.[17]\n\nConduct and seclusion\nAnother important aspect of purdah is modesty for women, which includes minimizing the movement of women in public spaces and interactions of women with other males. The specific form varies widely based on religion, region, class, and culture. For instance, for some purdah might mean never leaving the home unless accompanied by a male relative, or limiting interactions to only other women and male relatives (for some Muslims) or avoiding all males outside of the immediate family (for some Hindus).[18] For Muslims, seclusion begins at puberty while for Hindus, seclusion begins after marriage.[18]\n\nEffects\nPsychology and health\nBy restricting women\'s mobility, purdah results in the social and physical isolation of women.[19] Lack of a strong social network places women in a position of vulnerability with her husband and her husband\'s family. Studies have shown that in conservative rural Bangladeshi communities, adherence to purdah is positively correlated with the risk of domestic violence.[19] The restriction on women\'s mobility limits their ability to access health care and family planning services, especially for unmarried girls. In rural Pakistan, unmarried women and girls had trouble accessing healthcare facilities even in their own villages due to purdah; all types of women had difficulty accessing facilities outside of their villages because they had to be accompanied.[20] Along the same vein, studies of women\'s contraceptive use in Bangladesh shows that women with decreased observance of purdah and increased mobility are more likely to use contraceptives.[21]\n\nEconomic participation\nBy restricting women\'s mobility, purdah places severe limits on women\'s ability to participate in gainful employment and to attain economic independence.[22] The ideology of purdah constricts women in the domestic sphere for reproductive role and places men in productive role as breadwinners who move through public space.[9] However, due to economic needs and shifts in gender relations, some women are compelled to break purdah to gain income.[9] Across countries, women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to observe purdah less because they face greater financial pressures to work and gain income.[9] Studies show that "it is the poorest, most desperate families that, given the opportunity, are more willing to stress purdah norms and take the social risks entailed when women engage in wage or self-employment.[22] For instance, rural women in Bangladesh have been found to be less concerned with propriety and purdah, and take up work where available, migrating if they need to.[23] They take up work in a variety of sectors from agriculture to manufacturing to the sex trade. However, other studies found that purdah still plays a significant role in women\'s decisions to participate in the workforce, often prohibiting them from taking opportunities they would otherwise.[24] The degree to which women observe purdah and the pressures they face to conform or to earn income vary with their socioeconomic class.\n\nPolitical participation\nSocial and mobility restrictions under purdah severely limit women\'s involvement in political decision-making in government institutions and in the judiciary.[9] Lack of mobility and discouragement from participating in political life means women cannot easily exercise their right to vote, run for political office, participate in trade unions, or participate in community level decision-making.[13] Women\'s limited participation in political decision-making therefore results in policies that do not sufficiently address needs and rights of women in areas such as access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities, property ownership, justice, and others.[9] Gender imbalance in policy-making also reinforces institutionalization of gender disparities.[9]'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'svc49b'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/svc49b/those_equating_hijabburkha_with_pagdi_are_doing_a/</li>

There was nowhere to go. My cousins lived in places where they could go out to eat. Our whole day was spent in that same place attending classes and going for lunch and dinner in a hall in the same premises. The place was poorly ventilated with little to no sources of daylight. Mobiles were not allowed by which I mean you could use your mobile for only an hour per day and then they were taken back from us and locked away. Food was bad. There were cameras everywhere and things would get stolen despite that. There were only three toilet for all of us. One on each floor. Even if you had to go to toilet at 2 in the night toilet is engaged. Bad food, low light, no air, cameras everywhere. Later in life I realized the place was like a prison in every respect.\n\n--x--\n\nThere was this sir, our warden. The creep would barge into our room anytime without knocking. Atleast he was good to Neha. He would tease and joke with her her and she would punch him on his belly. I thought of telling her not to do that but refrained, why to snatch little pieces of happiness from her?It was good to see her happy. One day I could not hold back and told him politely to know before he enter the room. “you girls were not coming out and it was getting late for dinner”, he did knock after that but not always.\n\n--x--\n\nDays were going by like this. Me and Neha grew closer. As time passed Neha became more open with me. She told me how her cousin used her after promising to marry her and than left her. He avoids her now. I was taken aback.\n\nI liked working out and when i use to think about Neha i felt like crying. Still so young and unable to run or workout. How she must feel Its hard for me to even imagine. Her life was filled with tragedies. She was into herself and sad most of the time.\n\n--x--\n\nNigar lives in the next room. She said Neha stole her jeans. I was furious. I think they pick on Neha cause she is the youngest and weakest. Law of the jungle. Why does she think that? Neha was spotted near the place her jeans was drying. Its in cctv camera but she is not seen coming back or stealing the jeans. I told Nigar this is flimsy evidence and she should think before saying something about someone. She kept on saying this to everyone who would listen that Neha stole her jeans.\n\n--x--\n\nTheft was a real problem in the hostel that much was true. My own undergarments were stolen. I have a thing for lingerie. Being a student i did not have much money to spend on my weakness but i had a really nice half cut bra. It opened at front. I bought it for 1200/-. It was kind of a big deal. The truth is it was forced on me by an elderly sales woman who took advantage of my youth and desire for that bra in my eyes. It was stolen. Who wears stolen inner wears? Even if i find out the answer I won’t be touching it againt after it has been worn by someone else. So it went down the drain. Nothing can be done about it.\n\n--x--\n\nHer name was Anjum. Everyone called her Anju. She and Neha were good friends since before my arrival which always struck me as odd. Everyone knew about Anju and her four boyfriends, that number went up and down and characters changed but more or less it was three or four. What do they talk about Neha and her? These are the kind of girls that spoil young girls. I tried to probe Neha about it indirectly but she was tight lipped. She would tell eventually. She won’t be able to hide things from me for long. Who else would she tell.\n\n--x--\n\nHolidays started and many people went back home. Nigar came to my room and said I did not do the right thing by supporting Neha. She is the one who stole her jeans. I asked her to let go of the jeans and it can’t be. She asked me to come with her. What new imaginary evidence does she have? This is tiring. Could she be right though?\n\nFew days back when Neha was here in the hostel I saw something. She was wearing a misfitting bra under her shirt. I think it was my bra. I touched her back and asked her how she was. In that moment i knew there was no hook behind. She is wearing a misfitting bra that opens in front. I am almost sure its my bra that was stolen.\n\nNigar took me to the tailor near our hostel. He was the one nearby and almost all girls use to go to him. Nigar went there and she saw her jeans. She asked her the old man who gave this jeans. Had it been someone else he would not have been able to describe her so easily. He told it was a girl who could walked bent forward.\n\n--x--\n\nNigar showed me something more. There was a mobile Anjum kept secretly. It was not hers alone. Neha and Anjum used that mobile. Messages on it made everything clear. There were messages from several guys. Most of them were for Neha. One message read, “it was fun when you last met in my room last time. When are you coming again?” This was for Neha. It was from our warden. The same “sir” who would barge in without knocking. Now I see his familiarity with Neha in a different light.\n\nNeha was a sex addict who had relations with multiple men and was blackmailing them into giving her money and other things. Anjum went along with it at first but she was really afraid once umber of guys increased. She told Nigar everything. “Don’t know what would happen with Neha but my family members would kill me if they found out” Anjum said to her.\n\nNigar confiscated the mobile and told her to go home and nevre come back if she want to get out of all this. About Neha’s hand, years later after gaining more experience and knowledge I realized Neha’s strange hand had all the features of a cunning criminal mind.\n\n--x--\n\nAfter all this I left for home. I was not keeping well. I met Neha again but I was not in good health all my focus was on packing and leaving hostel. This place with no light or air and bad food. It all affected me and I wanted out as soon as possible.\n\nI left for a few months and when I came back it was to pack all my things and leave the place forever. That was the last time I saw Neha. She and sir were sharing a joke in the corridor. I don’t know what happened to her after that.\n\n--x--x--'<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'sv9ona'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sv9ona/hostel_stories_polio_neha/</li>

      <li>Title::: "A Deep analysis of 'Hungama' and Why romantic scenarios as portrayed in Bollywood used to be/still are extremely toxic and harmful to the Youth"<br />Body: " \n\nSo me and a friend revisited Hungama after quite a long time and to me it's one of the most legendary comedies written in Indian Cinema History with not a single bad actor, but there were points in the story we couldn't help but notice and why even in a sweet harmless comedy the portrayal of relationships is atrocious. All of these center around Anjali (the Rimi Sen character):\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n1. It begins with her coming to Mumbai to escape being married to a Landowner's daughter and earn enough to get off her debt (Already gotta feel bad for her), and she has to act as a fake wife with Aftab to get a place, and after a sweet back and forth there's a scene where she's clearly wet after rainfall, she's uncomfortable with a horny Aftab staring at her and post the song the dude literally jumps on her. Straight up creepy.\n2. At Tiwari (Paresh's house) she comes for the job offer and Paresh clearly is all flirty making her quite uncomfortable (played brilliantly by her no cap) and it hurts to see how she can't even go and find a job offer with peace.\n3. The most problematic part comes with Jeetu (Akshaye Khanna), the dude who owns the store. Dude asks God that 'please ise pata do', is clearly taking advantage of being a boss dropping her home (and oh god the cheesy 'tab tak mai tumhe dekh sakta hu na' when she gets off the car. Like, throw a person's comfort and space out the window) taking her out to movies and dude JUST CAN'T TAKE A DAMN HINT. If I had a shot everytime Anjali showed her disinterest I would die of alchohol poisoning. Add to that Jeetu's relentless chase.\n4. The climax and how the dudes actually presented themselves. I cringed at Akshaye's proposal, he's literally like 'Dun care if you no rich, you hot and I gotta settle'. I was honestly expecting her to show a middle finger to both the dudes and leave at the end but yeah to Raju's credit he did showcase a tiny bit of care by the very end.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nAll in all, the revisit was of course as hilarious as any but honestly I couldn't help but feel bad for Anjali. Poor girl just wanted to be left alone and be independent. Also the relationship portrayal is extremely toxic and it does affect young minds more often than not because that's how people begin to 'think' real life relationships work. Add to that the inherent stalking and staring by both the heroes, the quintessential persistent chase and the 'will do anything for my pyaar just cause she's rich'."<br />Author: 'for_acadamia'  id: 'sugq7m'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sugq7m/a_deep_analysis_of_hungama_and_why_romantic/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How many people here call themselves conservatives?'<br />Body: 'I’m guessing most people here are on the ‘right’ or that term that I hate, ‘non-left’. One of the things that makes the right different from the left worldwide is the general diversity of ideologies on the right which leads to a lesser amount of unity. In my opinion that is just how it is, and we need to accept that.\n\nHaving said that, I wanted to know how many people here think of themselves as Indian conservatives as opposed to nationalists, traditionalists, ‘liberal-right’ (raita I guess?) or libertarian?\n\nLet me define my terms to help everyone think a little, I think of myself as an Indian conservative (a tiny minority I’m sure) and this is what I think it means to be an Indian conservative – \n\n1. Aim to conserve Indian civilization. This means to conserve institutions and customs that make India what it is. This is a little bit of a sticky point because some customs or traditions within Indian culture are harmful to the civilization. In my opinion caste discrimination is a great danger to the civilization as it is such an easy point to attack and impossible to defend.\n\n2. Respect for religion. I am an agnostic when it comes to religion. I feel myself starting to get tugged towards my family’s hindu faith but I’m not there yet. However, I really do not think one can be conservative if you also have negative emotions towards the very idea of religion. Of course, this point needs more disentangling. Do we mean all religions? Can you have respect for religion in general but oppose certain religious practices? I have my own answers for this but I think these topics require debate.\n\n3. Evolution is a better form of progress than revolution. To be a conservative of any shade you must be against revolution. Revolutions destroy institutions and every institution, whether its work is good or not, plays a certain role that upholds the resting state of society. It is better to slowly transform these institutions than to get rid of them in one sweep. I think the farm laws fracas has taught us this. The central govt failed in doing this ‘big bang’ reform and in the process set back reforming agriculture in India by a decade at least. A better way to do this is one state at a time. It might take longer, but it will be more successful and less disrupting.\n\n4. Private (non govt) institutions have a right to be run how they see fit. This is a catch all point for private companies as well as temples, press etc. An example for something I am against as a result of this opinion is the Sabrimala temple court judgment. I am not a devotee of the temple and as a result, my opinion about how the temple is run should not hold any water. Similarly, the government should have no right to dictate how the temple functions. The devotees and temple administration are the only people who should have a say. Any change should be driven by them through their institutional practices. Of course, there are weaknesses here. What if some organization prevents the entry of people from SC/ST communities? Well then, we go back to point 1. This would be something that would be bad for the civilizational interests. In my opinion this is where the government can legitimately step in. People will have their own views and that is why we have politics to decide what the government should do.\n\n5. Process is almost more important than outcome. When a process is defined, such as the parliamentary process to pass laws, then they must be followed. When processes are defined in an unwritten way, such as customs, they must be followed. Change should be sought while following the processes. Short circuiting processes leads to a lack of legitimacy and can cause great problems down the line. For example, the ban on firecrackers should be done by a legislative body or at worst and executive body. Not the courts. The fact that it is done by a body that is not representative of the people is why there is open flouting of the ban and thus reduces the institutional authority of the court.\n\nThis is a rough list that I could think off. The lack of Indian conservatives on the internet and in political debate in India is a problem in my opinion. If you are a conservative, then let me know if you would add a point or modify anything.'<br />Author: 'qwertyuiop885'  id: 'stxqda'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/stxqda/how_many_people_here_call_themselves_conservatives/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is meant by the term "Third World?"'<br />Body: 'Initially the term "Third World" was used during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Warsaw Pact. The United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Western European nations and their allies represented the "First World", while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Vietnam and their allies represented the "Second World". This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political and economic divisions. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc and ‘Second World’ ceased to exist, and with it, so did the term. But, the use of ‘First World’ and ‘Third World’ remained. The key unifying characteristic of the non-aligned countries of the ‘third world’ was poverty (and colonization) and so the term evolved into a blanket term to describe this. \n\nToday it is being replaced with terms such as developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South. The concept itself has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world and historically poor countries have transitioned to different income stages.\n\nIn the early post WWII years, the term did not have the negative connotation of poverty and underdevelopment and was more synonymous with non-alignment. In fact, for Bandung (Indonesia) conference attendees the **Third World Project** was an attempt to build an imagined community that allowed Third World actors to accommodate their goals of the three intellectual pillars: economic development, racial solidarity, and non-alignment in the Cold War.  The Third World project takes its fullest shape by the early- to mid-60s. At that moment Third World leaders come to use those terms in how they articulate to their people what they envision in a post-colonial world.\n\nAs one can imagine, the term, "Third World" is also deeply tied in to the history of development as it was assumed that the Third world aspires to the kind of development in First World countries.  Its worth keeping in mind that the world today is markedly different from the one in which the post-World War development enterprise was originally built and many of these assumptions about development are also being questioned. The world has gone from decolonization to cold war, to collapse of the soviet union, to narratives on superpower hegemony and rising powers. The early optimism of the 50s and 60’s and hopes in development have been replaced by a more reserved sort of idea of development simmering in a sea of discontent.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe concept of ‘Third World’ as a synonym of the underdeveloped world was introduced by the French scholar Alfred Sauvy on precisely 14 August 1952 in a short article entitled ‘Three worlds, one planet’, published in L’Observateur. Unlike the anglo usage, the French form of the concept is that the adjective ‘tiers’ points not to the hierarchy of worlds, but to the share that one world has in the international community (one third).\n\nSauvy, built on the work of Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, a Roman Catholic abbot and French revolutionary who wrote the famous pamphlet, What Is the Third Estate? In pre-Revolutionary France, the Third Estate referred to the peasants who had too little property or political power to be included in the First Estate (the nobility) or the Second Estate (the clergy). Sauvy simply used the three estates in pre-Revolutionary France as an analogy applicable to the capitalist countries (the First World), the communist countries (the Second World), and the underdeveloped countries that were left (the Third World). Sauvy even used the word "tiers," which was an older form of the French word for "third," in order to make the connection clearer between the Third World and the peasantry of pre-Revolutionary France.\n\nIt’s worth noting as an aside that outside of its current usage, the term itself arose even earlier in literature and journalism at the end of the 19th century with a completely different meaning. In 1892 V I Lamansky, a famous Russian, published a paper concerning the three worlds of the Eurasian continent, where, according to him, apart from Europe and Asia there also existed a ‘third world’—Russia . In a text dating from 1922 on the subject of Russia, the Polish scholar and journalist Marian Zdziechowski also used the concept of ‘third world’. \n\n**Meaning**\n\nThe dominant interpretation of the concept ‘Third World’ at the present time is economic or socioeconomic, focusing on the phenomenon of underdevelopment. Thus in general the Third World is currently taken to mean poor, undeveloped countries with an unsatisfactory quality of life. In 1979 Leslie Wolf-Philips argued that ‘Third World’ had become synonymous with the term ‘the underdeveloped countries’ at about the beginning of the 1960s. Thus the the original meaning of the term, referring to non-alignment and international relations, gradually started to lose ground to the developmental understanding of it only in the 1970s. It is thought that most probably this usage of ‘Third World’ achieved global recognisability in a period of no longer, or not much longer, than a decade, no later than at the end of the 1950s or beginning of the 1960s.\n\nThe period from the end of the Second World War through to the late 1950s was once dubbed by Malcolm X the ‘tidal wave of color’ because it brought with it a tsunami of decolonisation which swept the old colonial empires away. The newly emerging countries were young. Their situation led to them being very sensitive (at least verbally) to actual and alleged violations of their recently gained independence, although of course their practical margin of sovereignty was very varied. In this context it was signiﬁcant that the numeral ‘third’ (and similarly the noun ‘world’) had associations  of  ‘other’,  ‘diﬀerent’,  ‘independent’,  ‘sovereign’.  Thus the concept ‘Third World’ implied otherness, independence and sovereignty in relation to the two powerful political–military blocs, as well as a claim to equal status. So the expression ‘Third World’ was very attractive to the countries of the global South, for it expressed and fulﬁlled their deep expectancy of independence, sovereignty and equality. The term carried hope of a global revolution which would not only bring freedom from the West, but also complete and total independence by means of the destruction of the hierarchy of a world built by Europeans which discriminated against the global South.\n\nOver time this positive perception changed. Some argued that the number ‘three’ designates not only a determined order (and in a hierarchy third is lower than ﬁrst, and so is worse—backward, impaired, with fewer rights), and it is also associated with being third-rate, i.e. belonging to a lower category suggesting insigniﬁcance, inferiority and mediocrity.  ‘Third’ thus came to correspond to such adjectives as ‘backward’, ‘underdeveloped’, ‘marginalised’, ‘worse’ etc and correspondingly, the global South by deﬁnition is, in a developmental sense, backward, underdeveloped,  marginalised, worse.\n\nThis usage panders to  stereotypes about the global South and indirectly boosts the image of the highly developed segment of the international community, it conﬁrms and communicates the latter’s superiority and excellence, and last but not least allows the stigmatisation of drastic departures from the standards of high development, including those occurring within the First World’s own borders. Furthermore, the  term ‘Third World’ facilitates the glossing over of the extreme wealth inequalities within the global South as a whole and also inside individual Third World countries (the  term suggests that everyone in these places is poor and exploited),  and     instead builds the illusion of solidarity between the elites and societies of the Third World, who from this perspective seem to stand together on the opposite pole to the global North. Thus you can have privileged children of the wealthy at JNU for example, claim to be fighting for  the rights of the poor in global sense. \n\nThe end of the Cold War, linked in popular belief with the collapse of the Second World and as a result with its elimination from discourse upon matters of the world, strongly under- mined the validity of using the expression ‘Third World’ in the opinion of many. They argued that quite simply at the latest after 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was not possible to count to three, and the term ‘Third World’ was thus an anachronism.\n\n**Aside 1:** This is a big topic on its own, but the concept of a Third World is deeply tied to development economics and foreign aid.  By the end of the 1960s, as the idea of the Third World came to represent countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that were considered underdeveloped by the West based on a variety of characteristics (low economic development, low life expectancy, high rates of poverty and disease, etc.).[ These countries became the targets for aid and support from governments, NGOs and individuals from wealthier nations. One popular model, known as Rostow\'s stages of growth, argued that development took place in 5 stages (Traditional Society; Pre-conditions for Take-off; Take-off; Drive to Maturity; Age of High Mass Consumption). Rostow argues that foreign aid was needed to help kick-start industrialization and economic growth in these countries.\n\n**Aside 2:** In the course of managing the OPEC oil crisis, and of defeating the Third World campaign for a New International Economic Order, Henry Kissinger, chief US foreign policy adviser at that time, floated the idea of a Fourth World of basket-case economies which would be spun off the global system and consigned to oblivion. Such economic triage, by forcibly leaving a people with grossly inadequate resources for self-sustenance, is a method of slow genocide. Keep in mind that others proposed mass murder on a horrendous scale, even a few nuclear bombs, to depopulate the planet. At the heart of the triage plan is the fact that the American Dream cannot be globalised. The Earth just cannot sustain it.  Because the US consumes such a large percentage of the world’s resources, it was thought that the spread of the American Dream requires a drastic depopulation of the globe. \n\nIn 1974, the U.S. National Security Council under Henry Kissinger completed a classified 200-page study, "National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests." The study falsely claimed that population growth in the so-called Lesser Developed Countries (LDCs) was a grave threat to U.S. national security. Adopted as official policy in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford, NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce population growth in those countries through birth control, and also, implicitly, war and famine. Brent Scowcroft, who had by then replaced Kissinger as national security adviser (the same post Scowcroft was to hold in the Bush administration), was put in charge of implementing the plan. CIA Director George Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft, as were the secretaries of state, treasury, defense, and agriculture.\n\n**Aside 3:** The "Three Worlds Theory" developed by Mao Zedong is different from the Western theory and both China and India are part of Mao’s Third World which he defined as consisting of exploited nations.\nAside: In the 1980s, economist Peter Bauer offered a competing definition for the term "Third World". He claimed that Third World status to a particular country was a mostly arbitrary process. The large diversity of countries considered part of the Third World — from Indonesia to Afghanistan — ranged widely from economically primitive to economically advanced and from politically non-aligned to Soviet- or Western-leaning. An argument could also be made for how parts of the U.S. are more like the Third World. He claimed the only characteristic common in all Third World countries was that their governments "demand and receive Western aid," the giving of which he strongly opposed. Thus, the aggregate term "Third World" was challenged as misleading even during the Cold War period, because it had no consistent or collective identity among the countries it supposedly encompassed.\n\n**Aside 4:** The term ‘Majority Word’ was coined by Shahidul Alam a Bangladeshi photojournalist, teacher and social activist. He began advocating for the uptake of this new term in the early 1990s as an alternative to ‘Third World’ or ‘Developing’. The term was created in recognition that the majority of the world’s population do not live in the ‘Global North’, or have white skin, but live in the colonised and exploited lands of the ‘Global South’. Yet the world’s economy and media are dominated by a handful of rich countries, who have the power to form the perceptions and narrative about the majority of the world.\n\nThe ‘Minority World’ is home to only ¼ of the world population and controls 4/5th of the income earned anywhere in the world. The ‘Majority World’, on the other hand, is home to ¾ of the world population, but has access to only 1/5th of world income.\n\n\nFor those who like bullets: [5 Reasons why the term is inappropriate](https://sites.duke.edu/dukeengagecapetown16/2016/06/23/five-things-wrong-with-the-term-third-world-countries/)\n\n1. The nature of the term implies entire nations are unsophisticated and alien.\n\n2. The term is simply out of date.\n\n3. It assumes a hierarchy between countries- and this is also true of the expressions “developed” and “developing” countries.\n\n4. These artificial labels lack legitimacy.\n\n5. The term depicts the ‘afflicted’ countries as inaccessible\n\n-----------\nInteresting little [film on Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFU2iQcFv7U)\n\n\nLinks:\n\n[WHY “THIRD WORLD” IS OUTDATED AND WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY INSTEAD](https://www.travelfordifference.com/why-third-world-is-outdated-what-you-should-say-instead/)\n\n\n[What Does It Mean When a Country Is Developed or Developing?](https://www.thoughtco.com/developed-or-developing-dividing-the-world-1434457)'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'sts2e8'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sts2e8/what_is_meant_by_the_term_third_world/</li>

First, we need  to define the problem statement and why we need to do what we are  talking about.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nOnce  Bharatvarsha was looked up to by everyone  anywhere in the world as the  source of knowledge and wisdom of highest order. We pondered and found  solutions to biggest and most abstract questions of life and existence  like what is the ultimate reality, what is consciousness, how can one  overcome the pain and suffering that life is. We also found answers to  common aspects of life like politics, justice &amp; economy etc. For a  long time now we completely deviated from that path. It made us week and  nowadays lowest of lowest people are pushing us around and trying to  teach us things. As a result we stopped thinking for our self and look  towards fools for their validation. You can see that happening in each  &amp; every action of our individual, social and political class. This  is on top of various other deformities that are there. Our foundation  has become so weak that nothing good can ever be built upon that. We  will always be a follower at best and subservient or slave at worst.  \n**Solution and the way forward:**\n\n* **Decolonize our minds, discover the truth.**  \n\n   * Read  and learn the real facts about our history, culture &amp; traditions.  Identify lies that have been taught to us and the truth behind those.  Spread that knowledge among people: your family, relatives, work, on  internet etc. A new foundation can only be built once the old &amp;  dilapidated one is demolished completely.\n* **Learn to be assertive and confident.**\n   * One  great weakness I find in myself and other Indians is that we are very  full of doubts and have low self esteem. We have so much inferiority  complex. It shows in various forms and manners. The degree may vary but  in most people it is there to some degree. A strong foundation can't be  build by clueless and weak workers.\n* **Final &amp; the most important step is to** e**mbed the wisdom of Vedas and Upnishads in every walk of our lives.**\n   * Vedas  &amp; Upnishads teach your the science of building the foundation which  can withstand the test of the times for eternity. That's what these  texts do. Show you the path to be the best version of yourself and thus  find the truth. Truth is not only something that we speak, it is that  knowing which you can achieve greatest of achievements. You'll be the  best son, father, guru, social worker, businessman, scientist, artist,  politician and wherever else you want to be. Vedas &amp; Upnishads show  you that path.\n* **Institutionalize above knowledge and systems in our country:**\n   * It  is a general good practice but doing things at small scales can't bring  about a great change. We need to do what can we do personally and in  groups but also make governments accountable. Create policies and  systems to make the right knowledge available to everyone including a  nursery kid to post graduate and even those not in a formal education  system. If it is possible to propagate trash like Bollywood films and  songs on mass scale then no reason something good can not be.\n\nPS: Please must read my comments for further elaboration and contexts."<br />Author: 'abhiccc1'  id: 'stqtj8'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/stqtj8/my_thoughts_on_how_can_we_bring_a_cultural/</li>

The events that had unfolded since had been so frighteningly in line with the prediction in the message. She had seen, before her very eyes, her father’s country taken by the Bactrians – herself and her family forced to take refuge with her sister, guaranteeing that she would never claim a throne of her own through standard succession, that even if she were to reconquer her country from the Bactrians, she would at best rule it as a vassal of her sister, never as a sovereign – and finally her entire family, excluding herself and her sister, massacred by the Greeks, seizing both Bactria and Kamboja. She had neglected to pursue her ambitions as the message had advised her to, and an ill fate had befallen her.\n\nWhen – here in a small Scythian settlement in Kamboja, the last realm whose people still regarded Gritachi with any respect – she had received, after so many years, a communication from this same Gandharan boy, now a young man, informing her of his visit to Kamboja and requesting a private audience – she had seen him as a messenger sent by the gods themselves – or a god himself incarnate, as the Indians might have said – and nearly began preparations to beautify the town for a great feast in his honour, before noticing his demand for utmost secrecy, and thus only performed the beautifications on herself.\n\nFor five days now, she had stood in her balcony and looked hopefully at every merchant and monk in Indian attire, awaiting her messiah – as a tribal child walked up to every returning huntress, in wait of her mother, or as the wife of a man at war hopefully craned her neck at every soldier in the returning march, in search of her husband.\n\nOn the fifth day, a Kamboja steed rode into town, on its back a man in his youth, clad in the classic Brahmanical attire under a coat of chain-mail – and he handed her a clay seal, with an engraved Indian character.\n\n“*Kau?*” she questioned.\n\nThe man explained, identifying himself: “Kautilya \\[1\\].”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Nothing can stand against an arrow shot by an Indian archer, neither shield nor breastplate nor any strong armour.*\n\n—Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri: Book VIII (Indica)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPabbata was trapped.\n\nThere was nothing he could say in protest to the Professor – Chanakya had done exactly as he had promised: he had sent Pabbata to campaign in Magadha, and Chandragupta to campaign on the Western end of the Northern Highway. But while Pabbata had accepted this as a means to eliminate Chandragupta’s competition by sending him far away, it now appeared to him that somehow, the *real* war was in the North-West, and that *he* was the one who had been sent away to Magadha.\n\nWhat made matters worse – the tasks that Chanakya had assigned Pabbata were obviously preliminary actions – sabotaging some forts, seizing revenues from some captured tracts, planting and testing some agents, raiding some treasuries, causing some chaos in the country – to a future *real* war. He supposed that if he were to question Chanakya on this matter, he would be lectured on the importance of planning and strategy.\n\n*Plausible deniability*, the Professor had said. *That was the trick to the art of double-crossing.*\n\nPabbata could not help but realize that his own trust in Chanakya’s loyalties grew the closer he was to him, and waned the further – Chanakya himself would have probably deemed this to be an irrationality of the prince, but Pabbata could not quite figure out which one of those proclivities it was that was contrary to reason.\n\nSuch was Chanakya’s trap, that it had made Pabbata completely reliant on him – by openly declaring war against his father, Pabbata had made an enemy out of the most powerful empire in the world, protection from which simply *required* a mind like Chanakya’s; and to abandon Chanakya here would only cause him to perish like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat.\n\nSighing, Pabbata continued his very possibly fruitless task of planting explosives in the fort.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*When the enemy is desirous of taking possession of the territory of the conqueror’s friend, then the conqueror may, under the pretence of compliance, supply the enemy with army. Then, having entered into a secret concert with the friend, the conqueror may pretend to be under troubles and allow himself to be attacked by the enemy combined with the neglected friend. Then, hemmed from two sides, the enemy may be killed or captured alive to distribute his territory among the conqueror and his friend.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.3\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGritachi watched as the mysterious visitor extracted the protective turban from his head, and detected the unmistakable scents of Indian steel and fabrics.\n\n“Greetings, *arya*,” —she knew that as a noble Scythian princess, she was not supposed to initiate the greeting until her visitor paid his respects, but she could not quite stop herself.\n\n“Greetings, Queen,” said Kautilya, and his voice was low.\n\nIt gave her a rush to be addressed as such – all her life, she had been seen only as a princess – or even less – never a heir, indeed completely invisible to those concerned with succession. No one – no one – other than this Kautilya, had considered her a queen worthy of *anything* – so far so that her family had kept the prophecies hidden from her.\n\nGritachi did not wait to expect formalities from the guest, and started gushing.\n\n“O *arya*,” she cried honestly, “I do not know what it is you see in me – I am no heir, merely the scion of a has-been family, I have no accomplishments to my name, I have not achieved anything of the level that you might expect from me, or that may have been prophesied of me. I am a prodigal child who has experienced great misfortune, and brought that misfortune to her family and people … ”\n\n“Prophesies are not made of the weak, stupid or lazy,” said Kautilya softly, and she found herself comforted by the honesty in his voice. Gritachi realized her eyes were teary, and wiped them.\n\n“Would you like some wine?” she asked, then chided herself. A noble should not be asking questions in such servitude – and she also ought to have known better to ask a Gandharan Brahmin if he wished for wine.\n\nThe man declined. “Do you wish to know,” he started, “What I honestly think of your self-pity?”\n\nGritachi shuddered. “Self-pity?” she asked, startled at that question.\n\n“The quality of complaining about one’s circumstances rather than determining the best action within the premises of those circumstances,” he explained, “For in fact, the circumstances you find yourself in are most fortunate ones.”\n\n“What?” Gritachi had to stop herself from bursting into tears at that comment. “My entire family is dead! – except for my sister, whom you say is my enemy. I have no country – not only not to rule, but even to so much as call as my own. You call these circumstances fortunate – I would hate to learn what you would deem a misfortune!”\n\n“There is a game played at Taxila,” Kautilya continued calmly, “Wherein the objective is to discard all the pieces in one’s hand. Amateur players often despair when their hand grows in size and celebrate when it drops – but it is often observed that in the manner that the game is designed, having two pieces in hand is not better than having twenty-three; depending on the pieces in his hand, the player with twenty-three pieces can reduce his hand to one in a move, while the player with two might end up in an unwinnable scenario – it is similar to how it is shorter to travel from Bactria to Tibet than from many Eastern countries in India, for not all roads are traversable.”\n\nGritachi stared, uncomprehending.\n\n“The command that formerly belonged to your sister now belongs to my student Shashigupta,” continued the mysterious Kautilya, “Who also possesses crucial secrets of the Bactrians and is able to manipulate them to his will. The ancient Persian empire has been replaced, and the Greeks who have taken their place have their routes to India running through Bactria and Kamboja, causing your country to be more strategic of a location than it has ever been. Even though you may currently possess no power yourself – all the other pieces are in order for the achievement of my goals, and your prophesied fate.”\n\nGritachi’s mind was swimming in questions, but the least significant one was the one that first made its way to her lips. \n\n“How?” she asked, “I mean – you seem a strategic man, I doubt you would simply have awaited for an opportune moment … ” Sure, it was possible that Kautilya had merely placed his trust in prophecy – regardless of how little Gritachi had done to prove herself – but she found the impression that in some confusing manner, every recent happening in her life had been engineered by him for some greater goal. \n\n“It was a game of seduction, not my proudest plot.” He looked proud. “I trained Shashigupta to obtain a reputation of notoriety among those Bactrian women close to the nobility, and with the help of well-placed spies, he attracted the attention of Princess Roxana—” Gritachi frowned at the mention of her rival’s name, it made her want to compete with whatever significance it was that Roxana held in this course of history as it was being written – by Kautilya, “—and extracted her country’s secrets from her, and subsequently blackmailed her for the favour of her next lover, the Greek king Alexander.” \n\nGritachi wondered if Kautilya was perhaps too dangerous of a player of these games of strategy – and briefly had the terrible thought that if Kautilya had been responsible for every event that had happened in her life, perhaps he was also responsible for the execution of her family by Alexander – perhaps this too was part of the manipulation through Roxana … but she was too overwhelmed by competitive thoughts against Roxana to quit now.\n\n“What do you want from me, *arya*?”\n\n“Several things – several things that will enable your eventual rise to power. But for now, I wish for you to be an enemy to Shashigupta and Alexander.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The conqueror may tell his enemy: “A chief with a powerful army means to offend us, so let us combine and put him down; you may take possession of his treasury or territory.” When the enemy agrees to the proposal and comes out honoured by the conqueror, he may be slain in a tumult or in an open battle with the chief (in concert with the conqueror).*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 13.3\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*One hundred and thirty four years ago.*\n\n*(460 BC)*\n\n*Years ago, Vāsudeva had argued with Samkarshana about the nature of the order he had instituted – argued that he was bureaucratizing the problem rather than solving it; that they could simply assassinate Ajatashatru rather than create an organization to fight the Magadhas for generations. It was not Samkarshana who had humbled Vāsudeva, but Ajatashatru himself: for each plot of Vāsudeva’s was matched by an diabolical counter-play by Ajatashatru, and that had made him quite less fond of the simplistic solutions he had thought of earlier.*\n\n*So when Ajatashatru had invited him to a private audience with him in a barren tract, Vāsudeva had immediately identified that the purpose of the meeting was to have the other assassinated, and demanded that the battle be a game of wits: neither party would be allowed to bring weapons, and each would be surrounded by their most trusted friends, to avoid frivolous and obvious games like replacing one’s opponent’s guards with traitors or bribing such guards to do one’s bidding.*\n\n*Ajatashatru’s interest had been piqued, and he had brought along with himself his son and some wicked ministers who shared his goals.*\n\n*Vāsudeva had brought with himself some trusted Brahmin advisors and classmates who shared his goals.*\n\n*“So you are the famed Krishna,” Ajatashatru commented, “Vāsudeva Krishna. I must say I am impressed by how you have fought against me. We are very similar minds, you and I – are we not?”*\n\n*“A mind is defined not only by its intellect,” said Vāsudeva, “But also by its morality.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru was fully naked, and his chest hair was dry and sticky, stained brown with blood, but nothing that posed a security threat – he had earlier excused his appearance by stating that he had just mauled a palm-reader who had foolishly approached him and insulted his intelligence by requesting royal funding.*\n\n*“Morality, religion … I expected better of you, Krishna. You must know that I have very little respect for such ideas.”*\n\n*When Vāsudeva did not respond, Ajatashatru continued:*\n\n*“Years ago, in the midst of my war against the Licchavis, when I had conquered only part of their country, I was approached by a band of celebrating monks, who told me they were very pleased with the outcomes of my conquest. Ordinarily, I would have beheaded them on the spot for the pathetic attempt at flattery, but I did not have my sword with me at the time – for I had been too occupied blinding a child after I had just violated his mother before his eyes – and so I entertained them.* \n\n*“They told me that they were celebrating, because their master had predicted my victory – for I was more righteous than the Licchavi king was, and I surrounded myself with better and wiser company than he did. Ordinarily, I would have not cared more than to remind my minister to execute this master and all his disciples. But I was bored, for the Licchavis were not worthy opponents as you have been, and decided to pay this master a visit.* \n\n*“And I told him: O Wise One, I have lost the war against the Licchavis. What do you recommend I do? And he replied: Indeed, this is just as I predicted – for the Licchavi king is more righteous than you, and he surrounds himself with better and wiser company than you do.*\n\n*“So I told him: my life has descended into tragedy, O Wise One! My kingdom is running out of wealth, my wife has left me as a result of my wicked ways, I am no longer able to find my daily quota of idiots for hunting. And he replied: embrace my religion, and all your problems will be solved.*\n\n*“I told him: I lied. My kingdom will never run out of wealth, as I can seize as much as I want from those I vanquish in battle, my wives cannot leave me as they are imprisoned, and I will never run out of idiots to murder, there are far too many of them. And I was enraged – I am always enraged when I am lied to – and so instead of murdering him, I beat him senseless until he could not speak complete sentences, then locked him with a parrot that had only been exposed to damaged lunatics; and then after a year of him re-learning language from this parrot, I returned him to his disciples.* \n\n*“He had been driven so insane, he blabbered such utterly meaningless words to his disciples – I thought there was no means by which he would ever be taken seriously again. I was interested to find if the disciples would abandon him or continue to care for him for what he had once been, if they would dismiss and ostracize their former master or if they would curse me for subjecting him to such a state. Imagine my shock: when the disciples immediately started worshipping him as their master – referring to him still as the Wise One – described his change in manner while in Magadha not as insanity, but as enlightenment!*\n\n*“He said such idiotic things as: desire is the cause of all suffering! And they created fabulous tales of his miracles – and when these tales reached the people, they went to him requesting that he perform for miracles for them – and when he was unable to perform them, his disciples shamed those who had pleaded his help, and created fabulous rationalizations for his inability to help them! And that was when I knew – how depraved the religious truly are – for they will believe and worship any man who dons a simple attire and lives as a hermit. I ask: how am I more wicked than this master? For I murdered my wife, while he left his to rot; I laughed at funerals, while he told people to not mourn. Not cursed – I am celebrated by his followers now as a hero for my role in helping their master reach enlightenment!*\n\n*“I have heard: the worshippers of Brahma are unable to obtain knowledge, the worshippers of Vishnu are unable to obtain wealth, and the worshippers of Shiva are unable to obtain strength – should I then simply choose not to worship any of these gods, if they are only hurdles in my path – should it not be my responsibility to overthrow such gods and seize the universe for myself? O, what a wolf can do, in a world of sheep!”*\n\n*But Vāsudeva cut off his long-time rival, nearly ignoring the entire monologue:*\n\n*“I suspect that you are intelligent enough to simulate in your head my argument against you – just as I am intelligent enough to simulate yours in mine. But that is not why we are here – no, not to debate religion.”*\n\n*“Indeed,” said Ajatashatru. “We should cut out the pretences: we are here to assassinate each other with our wits.”*\n\n*“Not quite,” said Vāsudeva.*\n\n*“No?”*\n\n*“If that were the objective, neither of us would have had cause to meet in person and risk mutual destruction. No – do make another guess at my objective. If we are truly of alike mind, then you should be able to discover it.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru pondered this challenge.*\n\n*“If you are of like mind to me,” he said at last, “Then you will bring a proposal that you believe to benefit both our goals. I cannot think of such a proposal.”*\n\n*“Your goal is the demonstration of what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” said Vāsudeva, “What is my goal?”*\n\n*“Some religious insanity.”*\n\n*“The propagation of the light of the Vedas and the prosperous civilization that it has created. Do you see any contradiction between these goals.”*\n\n*Ajatashatru was silent, thinking.*\n\n*“There isn’t,” said Vāsudeva simply. “I see you. Every instinct in your body tells you to behead me on the spot – but you have no sword. You fume – but it is because you know I am right.”*\n\n*“Do you truly think that conforming to the words of some dead old Brahmins is a wolf’s behaviour?”*\n\n*“O, what a wolf can do in a world of sheep,” Vāsudeva mimicked, “What, Great King? What can a wolf do in a world of sheep? A great deal of wicked – or a great deal of good—”*\n\n*“What’s the difference?”*\n\n*“If there is truly no difference, then why have you consistently chosen wicked over good? It can be no coincidence.”*\n\n*It was not common for Ajatashatru to be silenced – he was much too intelligent to be defeated in argument, and it was a great blow to his ego to have this done in the presence of all those closest to him – but whatever shred of sanity was left in him, that hadn’t disappeared over the course of his chaotic reign, managed to surface to acknowledge Krishna as his intellectual equal, as someone worthy of arguing against – at least so long as he did not engage in any specific moralizing.* \n\n*“So many of your actions,” Vāsudeva continued, “So much of your personality does not follow from your professed goal, even though you pretend it is. What goal does it follow from? Not demonstrating what a wolf can do in a world of sheep – no – but demonstrating that you ARE a wolf in a world of sheep.”*\n\n*“Are you calling me a pretender?”*\n\n*“It is not a wolf’s behaviour to conform for the purpose of conforming – and it is not a wolf’s behaviour to rebel for the purpose of rebelling – for in making an explicit effort to act in a way contrary to the words of these dead old Brahmins you speak of, you have made yourself a slave to their word, for every action you take you must first recall their word, and ensure that it is contrary to it.”*\n\n*“Very well. I will do what I want. I still do not see what your proposal is.”*\n\n*“I propose that you make me the heir to the throne of Pataliputra.”*\n\n*“ … ”*\n\n*“Father,” said Udayin, “You are not truly considering this proposal, are you?”*\n\n*“ … ”*\n\n*“ … Father?”*\n\n*“ … ”* \n\n*“ … ”*\n\n*“ … ”*\n\n*Udayin stood over his father’s lifeless body – his right hand grasping onto the needle that his most trusted attendant had advised him to tie into his hair during the meeting with Krishna.*\n\n*“O,” he drawled, “What a wolf can accomplish, in a world of sheep.”*\n\n*For once, he understood exactly what Krishna’s play had been – in demanding that they both attend surrounded by their most trusted associates, he had created an advantage for himself, for that was simply the level of trust his associates enjoyed in him – unlike Father’s associates ever had.*\n\n*“I believe,” Vāsudeva said almost inaudibly, as a battle-eagle circled in the sky far high above, “That it is now truly a world of only sheep.”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Vasudeva Sutam Devam – Kansa Chanura Mardanam – Devaki Paramanandam – Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum.*\n\n*The god sired by Vasudeva, the slayer of Kamsa and Chanura, the greatest son of Devaki, salutations to Krishna, the Preceptor of the world.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*    \n\n\\[1\\] *Kautilya* – “the cunning one”'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'stkf2z'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/stkf2z/the_great_empire_ch_3_yavana_kanda_33_fake/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India is the original home of unicorns &amp; unicorn myth of Europe.'<br />Body: 'Reproduced from writings of Finnish IVC archeologist Asko Parpola\n\n# The unicorn myth of medieval European bestiaries\n\n&gt;The unicorn was a popular beast in medieval "bestiaries" with their moralizing descriptions of real and mythical animals. It was usually depicted as a real animal (horse-like, but sometimes as an antelope or a goat) with a long, sharp, twisted horn set in the middle of its forehead. An excellent example can be found in the first printed travelogue, Bernhard von Breydenbach\'s *Peregrinatio in terram sanctam* of 1486; since the author claims to have seen it in the Holy Land, its model may have been the oryx antelope.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The bulk of European unicorn lore is derived from three primary sources of classical antiquity. The most recent of these is the** ***Physiologus***\\*\\*, a collection of the wonders of natural history written in Greek about 200 CE in Alexandria in Egypt4, which was an important center of trade between India and the western world at that time. Containing the first Christian interpretation of the unicorn myth, the Physiologus mentions the \'capture by means of a virgin\' motif. A significant detail is that after its capture, the virgin leads the unicorn into the palace for the king\\*\\* . While this is not found in earlier classical sources, it is attested in both Indian and Mesopotamian traditions:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"About the Unicorn. The Psalm \\[91 (92): 11\\] says: \'And my horn \\[tò kéras mou\\] will be raised as (that) of the of the unicorn \\[hōs monokérōtos\\].\' The Physiologus \\[\'the Naturalist\'\\] said about the unicorn that it has this very nature: it is a very little animal, looking like a kid, but very bitter. The hunter cannot approach it because of its enormous strength; it has a single horn in the middle of the head. How can it be caught? They dispose in front of it an undefiled \\[clothed\\] maiden, and (the unicorn) leaps upon her bosom \\[eis tòn kólpon, also \'womb\'\\], and the maiden suckles the animal and leads it into the palace for the king \\[eis tò palátion tôi basileî\\].*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Then it is assumed that (this) animal (is) an image of the Saviour, in fact: \'(he) raised a horn in the home of David, our father\' \\[Luke 1: 16\\], and it became for us a horn of safety. The angels and the powers might not rule over him, but he has taken abode in the womb of the true and undefiled virgin Maria \\[the Mother of God\\], \'and the Word has become flesh and has taken abode among us\' \\[John 1: 14\\].5"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Psalm is quoted from the Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the *Septuaginta*, assembled in Alexandria between the 2nd and 4th centuries CE. **In eight places, the Hebrew word** ***re\'ēm*** **(plural** ***rēmîm***\\*\\*) \'wild (urus) bull\' (cf. Akkadian\\*\\* ***rîmu*** **\'wild bull\') was translated with the term** ***monókerōs*** **\'unicorn\', which was then rendered in the Latin** ***Vulgate*** **translation as** ***unicornis*** **and in Hiob as** ***rhinocerus***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The *Kyranides*, a collection of writing attributed to Hermes Trismegistos in the first centuries of the Christian era, has transmitted a tradition related to the description of the unicorn in the Physiologus, explicitly connecting it with the rhinoceros:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;About the rhinoceros. 1. The rhinoceros is a quadruped animal resembling the deer, with a single enormous horn in place of the nose. It cannot be otherwise caught, if not with the sweet oil and beauty of well-dressed women. In fact it is amorous. 2. The stone which is found inside the nose or the horn of this (animal), when carried, chases away the demons. 3. Its testicles given to drink, or its sexual organ, to the highest degree stimulates the intercourse for men and women.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Pre-Biblical Greek records of swift elusive one horned ass of India with "invincible" &amp; magical horn which purifies poison\n\n&gt;The oldest classical source belongs to the Greek historian Ctesias. Ctesias served the Persian king Artaxerxes II Mnemon as court physician for some 17 years. After his return to Greece in **398/397 BCE he wrote two major works,** ***Persica*** **and** ***Indica***\\*\\*.\\*\\* These have survived only in summaries compiled in 9th century by Photius, the patriarch of Constantinople. The unicorn fills chapter 45 in Photius\' summary of Indica:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***In India there are wild asses \\[ónoi ágrioi\\] as large as horses, or even larger. Their body is white, their head dark red, their eyes bluish, and they have a horn in their forehead*** *about a cubit in length. The lower part of the horn, for about two palms distance from the forehead, is quite white, the middle is black, the upper part, which terminates in a point, is a very flaming red.* ***Those who drink out of cups made from it are proof against convulsions, epilepsy, and even poison***\\*, provided that before or after having taken it they drink some wine or water or other liquid out of these cups. The domestic and wild asses of other countries and all other solid-hoofed animals have neither huckle-bones nor gall-bladder, whereas the Indian asses have both. Their huckle-bone is the most beautiful that I have seen, like that of the ox in size and appearance; it is as heavy as lead and of the color of cinnabar all through.\\* ***These animals are very strong and swift; neither the horse nor any other animal can overtake them***\\*. At first they run slowly, but the longer they run their pace increases wonderfully, and becomes faster and faster. There is only one way of catching them. When they take their young to feed, if they are surrounded by a large number of horsemen, being unwilling to abandon their foals, they fight, butt with their horns, kick, bite, and kill many men and horses. They are at last taken, after they have been pierced with arrows and spears; for\\* ***it is impossible to capture them alive.*** *Their flesh is too bitter to eat, and they are only hunted for the sake of the horns and huckle-bones*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The animal described by Ctesias in this passage has usually been taken to be the rhinoceros, which plays an important role in unicorn lore. Yet at least two real animals have been confounded here. One is certainly the wild ass; expressly and clearly mentioned, it is described as having a white body, being very strong and so swift that neither the horse nor any other animal can overtake it, and able to kick and bite viciously. **The unicorn\'s ability to purify poisoned water, mentioned in the later version of the Physiologus and apparently dating back to the Zoroastrian tradition of the Three-legged Ass (which has a single horn), seems to me to have a natural explanation in the wild ass\'s ability to drink brackish water.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador of Seleucus I, visited the Mauryan kingdom of Candragupta in the Gangetic Valley and its capital Pataliputra around 300 BCE. He wrote *Indica*, a work in four books which described India\'s geography and nature, the Indian society and religion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aelian\'s *De natura animalium* 16,20,3 reports about the unicorn:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***And in these same regions there is said to exist a one-horned beast \\[monókerōn\\], which they call*** ***Cartazonus***\\*\\*\\*. It is the size of a full-grown horse, has the mane of a horse, reddish hair, and is very swift of foot. Its feet are, like those of the elephant, not articulated and it has the tail of a pig. Between its eyebrows it has a horn growing out; it is not smooth but has spirals of quite natural growth, and is black in colour. This horn is said to be exceedingly sharp. And I am told that the creature has the most discordant and powerful voice of all animals.\\*\\*\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When other animals approach, it does not object but is gentle; with its own kind however it is inclined to be quarrelsome. And they say that not only do the males instinctively butt and fight one another, but that they display the same temper towards the females, and carry their contentiousness to such a length that it ends only in the death of their defeated rival.* ***The fact is that strength resides in every part of the animal\'s body, and the power of its horn is invincible***\\*. It likes lonely grazing-grounds where it roams in solitude, but at the mating season, when it associates with the female, it becomes gentle and the two even graze side by side. Later when the season has passed and the female is pregnant, the male Cartazonus of India reverts to its savage and solitary state.\\* ***They say that the foals when quite young are taken to the King of the Prasii and exhibit their strength one against the other in the public shows, but nobody remembers a full- grown animal having been captured***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Megasthenes is almost certainly the source of this fragment, because it mentions the King of the *Prasii* (= Sanskrit *Prācyāḥ*, \'the Easterners\'), by which is meant Candragupta Maurya, Sandrokottos of Megasthenes. **What is here said of the foals almost certainly relates to the wild asses; Aelian says practically the same thing about them in** ***De natura animalium*** **16,918.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pliny in his *Naturalis Historia* (8,76) records the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***"In India there are also solid-hoofed bulls that have a single horn, a beast called axis that has deer-skin having many and rather white spots ... but the most ferocious wild beast is the unicorn, whose body otherwise resembles the horse but whose head is like that of the deer, the legs like those of the elephant, the tail like that of the boar, which has a heavy roar, and one black horn that projects two cubits from the middle of its forehead. They deny the possibility of catching this beast alive***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Solinus in *Collectanea rerum memorabilium* (52,39-40) rephrases this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***But the most atrocious is the unicorn, a beast with a horrid roar. It has the body of the horse, the legs of an elephant, the tail of a pig, the head of a deer. From the middle of its forehead protrudes a horn that has miraculous splendour and is four feet long and so sharp that whatever it attacks is easily perforated with its puncture. It does not submit alive to human power; it can be killed, but not captured***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Strabo in his *Geography* (15,1,56 p. 710-711) has preserved fragment 27b:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*For* ***he \\[Megasthenes\\] says*** *that the monkeys are stone-rollers, and, haunting precipices, roll stones down upon their pursuers; and that most of the animals which are tame in our country are wild in theirs.* ***And he mentions horses with one horn and the head of a deer (híppous te légei monokérōtas elaphokránous); and reeds***\\*, some straight up thirty fathoms in length, and others lying flat on the ground fifty fathoms, and so large that some are three cubits and others six in diameter\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aristotle, *De partibus animalium* 3,2,9 says:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The great majority of the horned animals have two horns, just as, in respect of the parts by which its movement is effected, the body is divided into two— the right and the left. And the reason in both cases is the same.* ***There are, however, some animals that have one horn only, e.g. the oryx (whose hoof is cloven) and the so-called Indian ass (whose hoof is solid). These creatures have their horn in the middle of the head***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A variant of this is in Aristotle\'s *Historia animalium* 2,1 p. 446b:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Further, some animals are horned, some hornless. Most of the horned ones are cloven- hoofed, e.g., the ox, the deer, and the goat; we have seen no solid-hoofed animal with a pair of horns.* ***But a few, e.g., the Indian ass, have a single horn and are solid-hoofed.*** *The oryx has a single horn and cloven hooves.* ***The only solid-hoofed animal with a huckle-bone is the Indian ass***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Philostratus (c. 165-250 CE)24 in his *Vita Apollonii* (3,2) remarks:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***And they say that the wild asses \\[toùs ónous dè toùs agríous\\] are also to be captured in these marshes, and these creatures have a horn upon the forehead, with which they butt like a bull and make a noble fight of it; the Indians make this horn into a cup, for they declare that no one can ever fall sick on the day on which he has drunk out of it, nor will any one who has done so be the worse for being wounded, and he will be able to pass through fire unscathed, and he is even immune from poisonous draughts which others would drink to their harm***\\*.\\* ***Accordingly, this goblet is reserved for kings, and the king alone may indulge in the chase of this creature. And Apollonius says that he saw this animal, and admired its natural features;*** *but when Damis asked him* *if he believed the story about the goblet, he answered: \'I will believe it, if I find the king of the Indians hereabout to be immortal; for surely a man who can offer me or anyone else a draught potent against disease and so wholesome, will he not be much more likely to imbibe it himself, and take a drink out of this horn every day even at the risk of intoxication? For no one, I conceive, would blame him for exceeding in such cups.\'*\n\n# 3 legged one horned water purifying ass of Avesta who causes rain and thunder\n\n&gt;Ctesias got his information on the Indian unicorn in the capital of Persia.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Ctesias\' account of the horned wild ass and its purifying function has counterparts in Zoroastrian literature. These have as their background a single brief reference in the Avesta, namely Yasna 42,4: "we worship the pious Ass (*****xara-*****) which stands in the middle of the Sea Vourukaša".**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The *Mēnōg ī Xrad* (62,26-27) notes:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"26. The Three-legged Ass sits in the middle of the Sea Walkaš. 27. (It) completely polishes and purifies with (its) watchfulness (pad wēnišn) all the water which rains on the dead matter (nasā), on the menstruation (daštān) and on the other excrement (hixr) (—and on the filth—) when it arrives to the Three-legged Ass."*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The *Bundahišn* (ch. 24 D in Iran) contains a long and elaborate commentary:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*"10. As regards the Three-legged Ass, (He) says: \'***It stands in the middle of the Sea Frāxwkard and has three feet, six eyes, nine testicles, two ears, one horn, a dark-blue head, white body, and spiritual food, (and he is) holy.*** *11. And of those its six eyes, two are in the eye-sockets, two on the top of the head, two on the hump, and by means of those six eyes it overcomes \\[the danger and\\] the worst destruction...15.* ***That one horn is as it were golden and hollow (or, golden like a horn-trumpet).*** *Another thousand horns have grown therefrom, some of which are as big as a camel, some (are) as big as a horse,some as big as an ox and some as big as an ass, great as well as small; by means of that horn it destroys and shatters all that worst pest of the fighting xrafstars. 16. When that Ass takes a round in the sea (and) bends its ears, all the waters of the Sea Frāxwkard furiously tremble, (and) (its) sides and centre are in turmoil. 17.* ***When it brays, all the Ohrmazdean female water-creatures become pregnant, and all the pregnant xrafstars of the water***, when they hear that bray, cast as corpses (their young). 18. When it stales in the sea, all the water in the seas — which is in the seven Kišwars of the earth — becomes purified. For this reason all the asses, when they see water, they stale in it.\' 19. As (He) says: \'***If the Three-legged Ass would not have purified the water, all the waters would have perished because of the contamination which the Evil Spirit (Gannāg Mēnōg) had brought on the water for the death of the creatures*** ***of Ohrmazd.*** *Tištar can seize more water from the sea with the assistance of the Three- legged Ass.* ***And ambergris — it is known — is the dung of the Three-legged Ass;*** *for, (even) if its food is mostly spiritual, the moisture and the nutrition of the water goes to (its) body through the pores and (the Three-legged Ass) casts (it) away as urine and dung.\'"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Tištar mentioned here is the star Sirius, who in the Iranian tradition is the liberator of waters (comparable to Vedic Indra, the god of thunder and war)31. Tištar\'s association with the Three-legged Ass is also mentioned in the Iranian version of the Bundahišn in chapter 21,5-6:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"5. When it rains owing to the defilement of the demons with excess and deficiency, (and with) harm, damage and contamination of the various divisions (of the earth), Tištar takes water from the entire Frāxwkard Sea. 6. As (He) says: \'The Three-legged Ass, which causes to move (the waters) in the Frāxwkard Sea, and agitates all the water of the sea, pours down the water on the sides of the sea. Tištar descends with the help of the frawahr of the right ones and also of the other celestial divinities\'."32*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The ass is also linked with atmospheric phenomena in the *Pahlavi Rewāyat* accompanying the *Dādestān ī Dēnīg* (35a5-6):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"5. (Zoroaster asked:) \'What (is) this thunderbolt which falls from the cloud?\'6. Ohrmazd said: \'This is a stone; when the cloud draws (up) water (from the sea), through the power of the wind and the movement of the Three-legged Ass which stands in the middle of the sea, it \\[i.e. the water\\] goes up (to) the atmosphere and burns and is heated severely, when it falls on men and beneficent animals it kills them, and Ahriman becomes more oppressive.\'"33*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**James Darmesteter has assumed that the Three- legged Ass is a celestial animal, whose urine is rain possessed with the power to kill demons. Darmesteter points out that this mythical animal of Iran thus corresponds to the heavenly bull, which many peoples have imagined as urinating rain**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Three-legged Ass\'s purification of water by means of its horn has been compared to Atharvaveda (Śaunaka-Saṃhitā) 3,7,1-2, where the horn (*****viṣāṇā*****-) of the swift-running gazelle (*****hariṇa*****-) is a remedy against a disease.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While discussing the Ṛgvedic references to the wild ass, I maintained that whenever *gaura*\\- is mentioned as a real animal, it denotes the \'wild ass\'. "From references to real animals I exclude RV 4,58,2-3, which speaks of melted butter as a bull (*vṛṣabhá*\\-) that has four horns, three legs, two heads and seven hands, calling it a \'four-horned *gaura*\'."36 This mythical wild bull of the Ṛgveda with its three legs is rather similar to the Three-legged Ass of the Bundahišn!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Iranian Three-legged Ass is a "hyper-phallic animal", "with its 9 (pair of ) testicles" and "its three legs clearly an allusion to its virile member, as in the case of the three-legged Priapus"37. Priapus was not only a three-legged phallic god, but also an ass- god.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Indian \'unicorn\' (ekaśṛṅga):The Ṛṣyaśṛṅga legend of Ramayana, Mahabharata, Jataka, Jain texts of one-horned Rsyasrnga who was conceived by copulation with a doe, and whose orgasm brings rains. Legend traced back to Jaiminya Brahmana in SamaVeda where with invocations of Rysa to Indra, a brahmachari practices ritual copulation with a prostitute after year long vrata\n\n&gt;**Ever since 1875, the European lore of capturing the unicorn by means of a maiden (which dates back to the Physiologus) has been connected with the Indian Ṛṣyaśṛṅga legend. The principal variants of this legend are found in the Mahābhārata (3,110-113), the Rāmāyaṇa (1,8-10), the Padma-Purāṇa (Pātāla-khaṇḍa 13), the Skanda-Purāṇa, Kṣemendra\'s Bhāratamañjarī (3,758-795), the Alambusā-Jātaka (Jātaka no. 523), the Naḷinikā- Jātaka (Jātaka no. 526), the Mahāvastu (141- 152), the Bhadrakalpāvadāna (33), Kṣemendra\'s Bodhisattvāvadānakalpalatā (65), the Kanjur (IV, Dulva, fol. 136-137), and the Jaina legend of Valkalacīrin in Vasudevahiṇḍī (16,16-50,2, quoted verbatim in Āvaśyaka-Cūrṇi 456-460), found also in the Āvaśyaka-niryukti (1164), and in Hemacandra\'s Sthavirāvalīcarita, Pariśiṣṭaparvan (1,90-258);** in addition, there are numerous short passages in various texts and Chinese translations of Buddhist texts. There are several extensive and penetrating studies of the Ṛṣyaśṛṅga legend  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The first book of the Rāmāyaṇa (chapter 8) describes the tale of rishi Rsyasringa, son of a rishi born after copulation with a doe, leading to Rsyasringa born with a horn on his head. Rsyasringa grew upto be a sage in his own right. When Indra grew angry with the king of the land and refused to send rains, it is told rains will come back to kingdom if rishi Rsysringa\'s tapasya is broken &amp; he is seduced.** The epic goes on to describe (in chapters 10-17) how the childless King Daśaratha invites Ṛśyaśṛṅga to perform the horse sacrifice on his behalf and then the son-producing sacrifice (*putrīyeṣṭi*). In this latter ritual, the king\'s three queens are given divinely charged porridge to eat, which impregnates them and causes them to give birth to four sons.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In the Mahābhārata, a prostitute brings Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to the palace of the king:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"An apsaras was cursed to become a female deer and to remain in this form until she bore a son to a sage. One day the sage Vibhāṇḍaka, the son of Kaśyapa, caught sight of another apsaras and shed his seed. The female deer drank his seed and bore Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who had a horn on his head.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Years later, a certain king transgressed against a Brahmin, and so Indra sent no rain in his land. The king\'s ministers advised him to bring to the palace the sage Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who had lived in complete chastity in the forest all his life and had never seen a woman. They said,* ***\'If Ṛṣyaśṛṅga may be enticed and lured into your kingdom, Indra will send rain immediately.\' The king sent a prostitute to the forest, and Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, thinking her to be a new, delightful sort of ascetic, invited her to perform tapas with him. She served him and plied him with garlands, drinks, and embraces,*** *until he was overpowered with love for her, emotionally aroused, and maddened with passion. When he described to his fathers the qualities of this \'ascetic\', \'his\' beautiful \'rosaries\' (garlands) and \'matted locks\' (long hair perfumed and bound with gold), his father warned him against such demons. Nevertheless,* ***the young ascetic took advantage of his father\'s temporary absence and followed the prostitute to the women\'s quarters of the palace, and the rain fell.*** *The king gave his daughter, Śāntā, to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga in marriage.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*When Vibhāṇḍaka returned and saw that his son had gone, he became furious and went to the palace to burn the king with his tapas. The king, however, having foreseen the wrath of Vibhāṇḍaka, had given much land and cattle to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, and when Vibhāṇḍaka saw his son\'s wealth he was pacified. He said to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, \'When a son is born, let the two of you come to the forest.\' Ṛṣyaśṛṅga agreed, and he later returned to the woods, with his wife Śāntā, to become a forest-dweller."*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jātaka text No. 523 repeats the theme of an ascetic\'s seduction by a prostitute, which is quite prominent in Indian literature, and which implies the concept that an ascetic who remains celibate accumulates creative power for himself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***"A Brahmin ascetic lived in the forest. A doe drank water mixed with his semen, fell in love with him, and gave birth to a male child named Isisinga \\[= Pāli form of Sanskrit Ṛṣyaśṛṅga \'Antelope-horn\'\\]. When the boy came of age, his father warned him against the wiles of women, initiated him into the practice of asceticism, and died. Isisinga practiced such fierce asceticism that Indra \\[the king of gods\\], fearing that the sage would depose him, sent the apsaras \\[heavenly nymph\\] Alambusā to seduce him. When Isisinga saw her, he immediately desired her and pursued her; she embraced him and his chastity was destroyed. For three years he made love to her, but then he came to his senses and realized that he had neglected his duties. He gave up the path of desire, and he forgave and blessed the apsaras. When she returned to heaven, Indra offered to grant her any wish, and she chose never to be made to tempt another sage."***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Jataka No. 526 includes the theme of drought that is found in most versions:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"Indra feared that the powers of a certain great sage posed a threat to him, so he sent an apsaras to seduce the sage, who shed his seed at the sight of her. A gazelle ate some grass and water mixed with the sage\'s seed and became pregnant. She brought forth a son named Isisinga, who was raised by the sage in seclusion in the forest* .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Isisinga performed such great tapas that Indra was shaken and determined to break down his virtue. For three years Indra sent no rain, advising the king, \'Send your daughter Naḷinikā to break the virtue of Isisinga and it will rain, for his fierce tapas has caused the rain to stop.\' She went to him and enticed him, and he thought her to be some marvellous ascetic. His virtue was overcome, his meditation broken off, and he made love to her. Then she ran away from him, and Indra sent rain that day. Isisinga longed for Naḷinikā, still thinking that she had been an ascetic, until his father realized from Isisinga\'s tale that a woman had broken his virtue.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In the Kanjur version, it is quite clear that the drought is due to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga\'s ascetic powers, and that the drought ends in rain when he is seduced to shed his seed:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***"One day when Ṛṣyaśṛṅga was carrying a pitcher of water, rain fell in such torrents that the pitcher broke. In anger, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga cursed the gods to send no rain for twelve years. Famine arose, and the priests told the king, \'This drought is due to the anger of a sage. If his tapas is destroyed, Indra will send rain.\' The king sent his daughter, Śāntā, to Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, who gave himself up to pleasure with the woman, and his magic power vanished. Rain fell. Śāntā, having conquered the sage with love, brought him to the king, who gave her to him as his wife."***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In Stūpa relief from the Caubārā mound near Mathurā, now in the Mathurā Museum, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga dressed in barkcloth (valkala) garment of a celibate student with a single horn on his forehead.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;In a version preserved in the Chinese Tripiṭaka, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga is called Ekaśṛṅga \'Unicorn\' and Śāntā is the name of a courtesan:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"The sage Ekaśṛṅga \\[Ṛṣyaśṛṅga\\] had obtained the five supernatural faculties \\[abhijñās\\]. One day when the rain had made the ground slippery on the mountain where he lived, the sage slipped and fell; and, since* ***he had the feet of a deer and was clumsy, he injured one of his feet. Irritated, he used a magic formula to prevent the Nāgas from sending rain for twelve years.*** *A great famine arose, and the king of Benares proclaimed, \'If anyone can make this hermit fall from his supernatural faculties and become an ordinary subject, I will give him half of my kingdom.\' ...* ***Śāntā, a courtesan, took 500 of her women to the forest, where they plied the sage with wine and \'pills of joy\'. They all bathed together, and when the women touched him, Ekaśṛṅga conceived sensual desires in his heart. He lost all of his supernatural faculties, and rain fell from the sky for seven days and seven nights."***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Jain version in Saṅghadāsa\'s Vasudevahiṇḍī also involves seduction by a prostitute, but here the hero is the lost brother of the king (and he is not horned):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*"A boy Valkalacīrin \\[\'clothed in bark garments\'\\] lives in a hermitage with his father who is not a brahmin ascetic but an abdicated king. On growing old, he had handed over his kingdom to the eldest son and had taken abode in the jungle with his wife. The queen died after the birth of her son Valkalacīrin. Hence the boy has grown up in the solitude of the jungle educated by only his father. He has never seen a female. However, his brother, the reigning king of the country, is longing for him. He sends courtesans to the hermitage who infatuate the boy with female charm and sweets. They make their escape before the father returns. Valkalacīrin goes in search of the so-called ascetics and finally reaches the city of the king. He arrives at the house of the courtesans and is washed and dressed by them. Finally his brother the king finds him, receives him with great joy and gives him in marriage."*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All the known versions of the Ṛṣyaśṛṅga date from the post-Vedic period. In fact, Lüders (1940: 1) pointed out that the name occurs in the teacher genealogies of the two Sāmavedic schools. According to the Jaiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa (3,40), Ṛśyaśṛṅga Kāśyapa received the immortal gāyatra *sāman* \\[ritual song\\] from Kāśyapa (who had learnt it from Indra) and in turn handed it down to Devataras Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa. In the Vaṃsa-Brāhmaṇa of the Kauthuma–Rāṇāyanīya school, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Kāśyapa is the son and pupil of Kaśyapa and the father and teacher of Vibhaṇḍaka53. In addition, Lüders felt sure that this Sāmavedic Ṛṣyaśṛṅga can be considered to be the same person as the Ṛśya, who in the Ārṣeya-Brāhmaṇa (3,6,10 in the Kauthuma version, 1,9,2 in the Jaiminīya version) is mentioned as the seer of a sāman in the Āraṇyaka-Gāna54.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I would like to expand here on this sāman and the context in which it is used in the Vedic ritual, given its relevance to the Ṛṣyaśṛṅga legend. In the Kauthuma-Rāṇāyanīya school of Sāmaveda, this sāman is recorded in Āraṇyaka-Gāna 5,1,2256. Its name is *Ṛṣyasya vratam*, but according to the Jaiminīya school of Sāmaveda, either *Ṛśyasya vratam* or *Bhūtecchandasāṃ vratam*, its seer is Kaśyapa, its metre anuṣṭubh, and its deity Indra. **The first part of the sāman is composed on the verse recorded in Āraṇyaka-Saṃhitā 4,9 and in Jaiminīya-Saṃhitā 2,4,358; the second part, which is composed on chanted interjections (*****stobha*****) that do not form regular phrases, is recorded in Stobhagrantha 2,659 and in Jaiminīya-Saṃhitā 2,4,460. These stobhas start with the word** ***ṛśyāsaḥ*** **\'(O) antelope bulls\', followed by vocatives addressed to Indra that are separated by the interjection61** ***bhuṅ*****, which is undoubtedly derived from the verbal root** ***bhuj*****- \'to enjoy\'.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to Pañcaviṃśa-Brāhmaṇa 5,4,13, with the chant of Ṛśya they address the *gārhapatya* \\[fire(place)\\]."63 The text goes on to explain this in 14: **"All beings (once upon a time) praised Indra with a chant; Ṛśya noted that one of his (viz. Indra\'s) members had been omitted in (these) chants; praising that one member, he reached the place dear to Indra. Through this (chant) they reach the place dear to Indra." The medieval commentator Sāyaṇa clarifies that by the "one member" (*****ekam aṅgam*****) is meant "the secret place of enjoyment" (*****bhogasādanaṃ guhyarūpam*****), undoubtedly the male organ.** Sāyaṇa also quotes a passage from the Śāṭyāyanaka (i.e., the lost earlier version of the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa); the passage quoted is actually found in JB 2,403, though with slightly variant readings. The key passage is difficult to interpret, but seems to gloss the immediately preceding verse composed with stobhas. Its final phrase describes "Indra who has his shuttle cleansed (*trasarapūta-*)". Indra is "one who has his \'shuttle\' (the stick that goes back and forth in the act of weaving) (*tasara-* or *trasara-*) again and again in the \'buttocks\'. The meaning of this is further clarified in the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa with the explanation that his unpraised single member was in the \'buttock\' (*sphigau, locative*)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**This ritual chant of Ṛśya belongs to the last part of the thirteen sāmaparimāds sung around the sacrificial area. They form an extension of the mahāvrata laud chanted at noon on the mahāvrata day at the end of a year-long sacrificial session. At this juncture, various rarely performed ritual actions take place, in particular the sexual union of a prostitute (*****puṃścalū*****) and a student of religion (*****brahmabandhu*****) who hails from the eastern country of Magadha. This action is prescribed in the Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa (2,404)** and in the Jaiminīya-Śrautasūtra71, but not in the Pañcaviṃśa- Brāhmaṇa; the Śāṅkhāyana-Śrautasūtra (17,6,2) prohibits its performance as an obsolete practice. **The participants are supposed to scold each other (for scolding is a purifying activity). The prostitute blames the student for breaking his vow of celibacy, while the student mocks the prostitute for cleansing every man\'s membe**r.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Jaiminya Brahmana quoted here is dated by western historians to at least 1000-1200 BCE.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The antiquity and agricultural affinity of the religious conceptions and practices connected with the ritual intercourse of the celibate student and the prostitute in the mahāvrata and in the Ṛśyaśṛṅga legend can be gleaned from a verse in the Atharvaveda (Śaunaka-Saṃhitā 11,5,12; Paippalāda- Saṃhitā 16,154,2): "Roaring, thundering, the ruddy, whitefooted74 \\[*****brahmacārin*****\\] has inserted a great penis into the ground. The** ***brahmacārin*** **pours semen over the surface, the earth. By that the four directions live." The term for the student\'s celibate asceticism is** ***tapas*****, literally \'(solar) heat\': it parallels the scorching heat of the sun, which culminates at the summer solstice (quite probably the day on which the mahāvrata was celebrated). The monsoon rains which end the long period of drought are symbolized by the celibate ascetic\'s shedding of his seed in the "divine union" of the sky and earth that is crucial for farming and animal husbandry. In archaic farming communities, it was common to perform ritual sexual unions as primitive fertility magic to induce rain.**\n\n***That Rsya Sringa is the Harappan unicorn will be covered in the next post.***'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'st7yhg'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/st7yhg/india_is_the_original_home_of_unicorns_unicorn/</li>

As someone who supports free speech, I have shared Gettr links a lot here.

Many things about the company's functioning and security are rather bizarre.\n\n&gt;Speaking with the outlet, a former Gettr employee didn’t hold back on what they felt was a culture of mismanagement and ineptitude at the tech platform. “In all honesty, in all my years of doing cybersecurity, I’ve never seen a company this poorly run from business operations all the way to IT,” the employee apparently told the Examiner. “It looks like a high school operation.”\n\nThere are now even allegations that the allegedly anti-CCP billionaire Miles Guo, who funds the app, is a double agent who's removing cybersecurity in order to allow the CCP to track its users and steal their data. I also remember reading that Gettr loads content from links from external servers and not a cached version on their servers - a huge security risk when sharing and viewing links. \n\nSince a lot of anti-CCP, pro-Trump people have signed up for Gettr, it is in the interest of foreign intelligence agencies to access/hack their devices.

Research to date suggests that certain athletes are at risk for suboptimal vitamin D status, which may increase risks for stress fractures, acute illness, and suboptimal muscle function.\n\nNow what most people in India who get tested for vitamin d think if this is close to or over 20 then they are good but this is not the case. Vitamin D deficiency is often defined as &lt;20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and insufficiency defined as 20-30 ng/mL(50-80 nmol/L) and optimal levels are greater than &gt;30 and even in some studies they are even &gt;40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L).\n\nA study on finnish military recruits found that Vitamin d levels below 30 ng/ml increases the risks of stress fractures and as athletes are more active physically then the general population the risk of injury increases further.\n\nFurthermore, it has been suggested that vitain D supplementation in individuals with low vitamin D status may improve muscle strength. This is believed to be due to an increase in the size and amount of type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers associated with vitamin D supplementation. So optimal levels of vitamin d enables a persom to get that explosive burst of energy that is required in sprinting, weight lifting, rugby or other any sport where explosive energy is needed.\n\nAnother 2011 study found that people who took close to 3300 IU of vitamin d had a positive impact on their testosterone levels when compared to people who were given a placebo pill. We all know how testosterone can increase athletic performance. So there is enough evidence that maintaining optimal levels of this vitamin d can enable a person to perform better but also decrease chances of injury.\n\nNow Inadequate levels of vitamin D play a major role for the development of diseases like rickets, colon cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, tuberculosis and even higher risk of developing severe illness in covid if people are deficient in the sunshine vitamin.\n\nSome study reports suggest that worldwide 1 billion people have vitamin d deficiency and close to 50 percent of the population have insufficient levels of vitamin d. And the main factors for this is , age, socioeconomic status, clothing practices, skin complexion, geolocation etc.\n\nNow a question arises that we Indians get enough sunlight throughout the year so why are we facing this problem in India\n\nThe main reasons for this are\n\n1. High levels of pollution, now if you live in delhi like me you know exactly what I am talking about in the month of November here the air was unbearable and people were being advised to stay indoor which is also a contributing factor in this deficiency.\n\n2. If you don't got out in the sun too much and are a vegetarian or a vegan than the chances are high that you could be deficient in vitamin d.\n\n3. Some other reasons are dark skin with and application of sunscreen which can all contribute to having low vitamin d levels.\n\nNow this deficiency can be countered easily by doing the following things\n\n1.Get enough Sunlight.\n\n2. Supplement with a vitamin d supplement if levels are too low.\n\n3. Eat foods fortified with vitamin d.\n\nSince athletes use their body physically more than an average person it's a good idea to check your vitamin d levels and make sure they are in mid 30's or even close to 40 it would be better and general people could should aim for higher 20' or close to 30."<br />Author: 'Devanand100'  id: 'ssskzu'<br />Score:403<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ssskzu/since_vitamin_d_deficiency_is_so_prevalent_in/</li>

In the 2018 revision of the syllabus, Mudi brought down the total number to 175 credits and now, with the NEP2020, it has gone down to 160. Apart from reducing the total number of credits, Fastist Mudi has also come up with subtle change in the system, the introduction of certificate based crediting. Under the new system, a student who had to actually learn (say n) number of subjects under the original 200 credit system, was subjected to a few subjects being taken off the subject or not going into the depth of the subject in the 175 credit system. Now with the NEP2020, colleges are forced to cut down on a few more subjects or the topics in those subjects. This in turn will affect the quality of education going down in the population, for example among a group of 3 students, where 1 is from the 200 credit system, the second is from the 175 credit system and the last student is from the NEP2020 batch, the most knowledgeable would be the 1st student, followed by the second and the third student in respective order. Thus, SC/STs who were now somewhat capable of achieving things in the current education system, will again go back to being a marginalised community.\n\n\nAlso, with giving the students the choice to choose their co-curricular subjects (singing, dancing or yoga), students will no longer have interest in studies and this will majorly impact the SC/STs because they have always been kept away from education.\n\n\nSo with this, I'd like to conclude my research theory on the oppression of the Dalits.

      <li>Title::: 'Has BJP fulifiled their Manifesto Promises?'<br />Body: " Has BJP fulifiled their Manifesto Promises?\n\nI would say majority. Let's look through:\n\n[BJP Manifesto 2019](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/realtime/BJP_Election_2019_english.pdf)\n\nFirst one is Nation First.\n\nCAA:\n\n“We are committed to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Bill for the protection of individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We will make all efforts to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the Northeastern states who have expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the linguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of Northeast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs escaping persecution from India’s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India”\n\nThis is pending for 2 years. Looking at the tensions, CAA needs to be implemented.\n\nSecond one is Doubling Farmer’s Income. Most of these are policy-in-progress.\n\nThey fullfed the cooperative promise by setting up the cooperative ministry for the farmers. \n\nGram Swaraj too is policy-in-progress.\n\n**India as the third world’s largest economy -&gt; Pandemic made the work slowdown.**\n\n“This implies that we commit to make India a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.” – 2025 seems realistic.\n\nWorld Bank record shows that as of 2019, India is at US $2.8 trillion. With the 2022 budget focusing on the necessary boost to the economy by focusing on capital expenditure, India should reach US $ 5 trillion by end of 2024.\n\nTax Policy -&gt;” Our economic policy has been guided by the principle of lowering the tax rate and improving compliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base, the tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in the recent past, up from 10.1% in 2013-14. This increased revenue has been deployed for benefits to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an unprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner – lowering of tax rate thereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance.”\n\nI was right. BJP strategy is to pump more money into infrastructure and then lower the tax rate for middle income. This has pros and cons but I guess infrastructure is important for the country so that everyone can benefit from it.\n\nInfrastructure is one section in the BJP Manifesto. I would say this is also work in progress. But one thing that they did extra is to have ropeways for the hilly areas. This is in planning stage right now. ([Ropeways Project](https://swarajyamag.com/infrastructure/centre-seriously-looking-at-ropeways-where-traditional-modes-of-conveyance-are-difficult))\n\nThe fact BJP listened to a consultant company is really remarkable. Ropeways are a fantastic idea. Question remains how will they implement and construct it?\n\nHealth for all too is work in progress. Here is one:\n\n“With our initiatives, we have successfully reached the stage of ensuring one Medical College for every three Parliamentary Constituencies. We will take it forward and set up one Medical College or Post Graduate Medical College in every district, through public or private participation, by 2024. To start with 75 such Medical Institutes will be set up by 2022. This would ensure availability and accessibility of quality secondary and tertiary medical care to the citizens across the diverse landscape of our country.”\n\nThis is still in work in progress. But the initiative has been quite successful in many states seeing such an initiative being implemented. Recently PM Modi dedicated 11 medical colleges to TN and 9 medical colleges to UP. It shows the level of commitment his government has.\n\n[11 Medical Colleges in Tamil Nadu](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/pm-modi-inaugurates-11-new-medical-colleges-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/88855393.cms)\n\n[Tamil Nadu - PM Modi](https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/chennai/prime-minister-announced-to-invest-3000-crores-in-tamil-nadus-health-infrastructure-over-the-next-five-years-724649)\n\nGood Governance is something I doubt will get fulfilled.\n\n“We are committed to the idea of simultaneous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilization of government resources and security forces and for effective policy planning. We will try to build consensus on this issue with all parties. Single Voter List - In order to ensure that every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all public bodies and to avoid confusion created by multiple voter lists, we will strive to ensure a common voter list for all elections.”\n\nSimulatneous elections is challenging. But it is a good idea. All voters will vote for the parliament and state assembly.\n\nYuva Bharat too has been quite successful as it can be seen from PM Modi’s push for entrepreneurship and startups.\n\n[16th Jan 2022 - Modi](https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/pm-declares-16-jan-as-startup-day-says-golden-era-of-startups-has-just-begun-11642237018254.html)\n\n[Startups Backbone](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/startups-backbone-of-country-development-modi-7725411/)\n\nEducation for all, women empowerment too is work in progress.\n\nInclusive Development is too work in progress. One part is in the manifesto:\n\nResponsive to the Needs of Aspirational Middle Class\n\n“After providing major tax relief in the recent budget, we are committed to further revise the tax slabs and the tax benefits to ensure more cash and greater purchasing power in the hands of our middle income families. We will make all efforts to ensure that our aspirational middle class has access to education, employment opportunities and suitable urban infrastructure for a beer quality life”\n\nLike I mentioned, after they have pumped the necessary money into the infrastructure, they will lower the tax slabs for the economy.\n\n**Let’s look at the cultural heritage:**\n\nUCC – This is the only item that has yet to be implemented. \\*Looks at PM Modi\\* \\*Kab hoga jee\\*\n\nThat’s all from me.

      <li>Title::: 'Everything Wrong with our Supreme Court'<br />Body: '  \n\nI feel that Supreme Courts and High Courts are like one of the main reason why the progress growth of our country is not that fast. They always have some sort of a problem. They fail to solve cases and many more. I blame the government too but I think they too hold a bigger hand in this destruction. I would just like to pin point some things that has made me think or feel like this: \n\n# 1. The number of pending cases: \n\nThere are about 73,000 cases pending before Supreme Court and about 440 lakh in all the courts of India. Some cases has been there for the past 30 years. This number was recorded in Jan of 2021 and by now it has most probably increased. Not to forget the longest procedure to file one. I know this because my extended family is going through a hard phrase and has a cases filed against the family members, won\'t go in details.  \n\nI have been told that there are some cases where the participants have passed away before their hearing because of how late it was. (IDK if it\'s true or not but it does sound true to me). \n\n# 2. False Accusations: \n\nIn 2014 SC had passed a hearing that even if there are no evidence of a women being raped the words of the women are sufficient for the court to throw the guy in jail. Now this is one of the most ridiculous  thing I have ever heard.  False accusations can too ruin life and give mental trauma, therefor the person should face charges against it. \n\n# 3. Legal Drinking Age \n\nI know this is not that serious but I still felt like pointing it out. The age is different from each state and in some states, it goes up to 25 years of age. It is very strange that a citizen has the right to elect the Government by voting at 18 years of age but is not considered as mature enough to decide if they can consume alcohol or not.  \n\n# 4. The Skin-to-Skin Judgement  \n\nThis judgement came from the Bombay High Court where the said that skin-to-skin contact was a necessary ingredient for punishing persons accused of sexually assaulting minors. This law thankfully reversed by the SC. \n\n# 5. Reservations: \n\nThe Supreme Court upholds 27% OBC quota in NEET quoting "Reservations not at odd with merit". I am not against reservations but the only reservations we need are- Reservations for the disabled ( not more than 5%), and reservations for the people who don’t come from well to do families ( 10% max). Even with this they should have proper passing marks. Reservations are the main reason I feel why our Government hospitals are pathetic. At least in Educational part there should be no reservations. I don’t know why they assume that every Brahmin is Ambani\'s relative. Duh! \n\n# 6. The Char Dharm Roads: \n\nThe Center has cited in front of the court that the  Chinese troop are  buildup on the other side and said under the circumstances, "wide roads are of strategic importance". But looks like the court has other ideas. "I am not going to say that environmental needs trump the defense of the nation but the Army has never said we want these wide roads" Mr. Gonsalves. \n\n# 7. POCSO Accused asked to marry survivor for bail \n\nThe Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping and impregnating a 17-year-old girl under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on a condition that he marries he after she attains the majority age of 18. \n\n# 8. Different laws for different religious communities: \n\nAlmost all of us are well aware to this I guess. Separate laws to govern each religion. The laws governing marriage, divorce, property, inheritance, adoption and maintenance are all different for Hindus and Muslims. Laws should be the same for everyone regardless to the religion. \n\n# 9. Nepotism: \n\nYes, nepotism in the judiciary. Govt gives collegium ‘proof’ of nepotism in picks for HC judges. A proper list sent by the Allahabad HC collegium consisted of close relative of judges, including the brother-in-law of sitting SC judge a first cousin of another SC judge beside sons and nephews of several other SC judges.   \n    \n    \n  I am sure there are many other thing too like giving bail to criminals and nowadays that Bollywood thing  but I can\'t recall all of them. Because of all these things I have lost my respect for the Courts. I know there might be some actual good laws and regulations but the bad ones always make out. If there is something wrong here please enlighten me.

THEY who lay quiet for a year, the Brahmans who fulfil their vows,\n     The Frogs have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath inspired.\n\n2. What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool\'s bed, the floods of heaven descended,\n     The music of the Frogs comes forth in concert like the cows lowing with their calves beside them.\n\n3. When at the coming of the Rains the water has poured upon them as they yearned and thirsted,\n     One seeks another as he talks and greets him with cries of pleasure as a son his father.\n\n4. Each of these twain receives the other kindly, while they are revelling in the flow of waters,\n     When the Frog moistened by the rain springs forward, and Green and Spotty both combine their voices.\n\n5. When one of these repeats the other\'s language, as he who learns the lesson of the teacher,\n     Your every limb seems to be growing larger as ye converse with eloquence on the waters.\n\n6. Onc is Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat the other, one Frog is Green and one of them is Spotty.\n     They bear one common name, and yet they vary, and, talking, modulate the voice diversely.\n\n7. As Brahmans, sitting round the brimful vessel, talk at the Soma-rite of Atiratra,\n     So, Frogs, ye gather round the pool to honour this day of all the year, the first of Rain-time.\n\n8. These Brahmans with the Soma juice, performing their year-long rite, have lifted up their voices;\n     And these Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles, come forth and show themselves, and none are hidden.\n\n9. They keep the twelve month\'s God-appointed order, and never do the men neglect the season.\n     Soon as the Rain-time in the year returneth, these who were heated kettles gain their freedom. (people get freedom from heat)\n\n10. Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat have granted riches, and Green and Spotty have vouchsafed us treasure.\n     The Frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season.\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_7/Hymn_103\n\nTo this day, frogs are considered heralders of monsoon &amp; in many places frogs are "married" to invite rains.\n\nApart from the beauty of the poetry, what it also proves is that Rg Veda was written in a tropical climate region with annual rainy season immediately after summers. Ie monsoons.\n\nAs the verse shows, rainy season played a central event in the lives of vedic composers &amp; Rig Veda itself obviously was mainly dedicated to the god of rains.

For all the MBBS and MDs we churn out on a regular basis, we see a surprisingly less number of psychiatrists and mental health specialists as a whole in most major medical establishments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, [Aasra](http://www.aasra.info/helpline.html) exists but I only found it out by looking it up.

If you dont live in any major city, youre essentially screwed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo matter who or what you are, whichever political side you lean toward, if you think that you or someone close to you needs help, seek the help you need. I mean shit, I admit that I suffer from anxiety and spells of depression from time to time that I need to claw my way out of and its hard as hell.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Canada begins to break up Freedom Convoy, Sri Lanka receives loans from India and Pakistan, and the history of the Arab Revolt'<br />Body: '***For all my previous posts in the Geopolitics Thread, see*** [***ididacannonball\'s Corner***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/ididacannonballcorner)\n\nWelcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss all the latest events from around the world. In this thread, I am happy to to share the second in a new series on the history of the Arabian Peninsula. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Canada begins to break up "Freedom Convoy"](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/canadian-trucker-protesters-bridge)\n\nThe government of Canada, in conjunction with the state government of Ontario, has begun to break up the anti-vaccine mandate siege of various sites in the country that has stretched on for weeks. Police broke up a part of the protest that had blocked the Ambassador Bridge for several days. The bridge connects the Canadian city of Windsor to the American city of Detroit, and is the busiest border crossing for trade purposes in North America. The blockade had forced some car manufacturers to halt production. The so-called Freedom Convoy continues to blockade the federal capital Ottawa, despite most of their demands being met by state governments - the government of Quebec, Canada\'s second-most populous state, dropped the plan for a vaccine passport, as did other states. Some protesters said that they will keep protesting until PM Trudeau himself resigns. Meanwhile, similar blockade-style protests are being planned in the US and parts of Europe against vaccine mandates. It may be noted that almost all the truckers participating in Canada were vaccinated.\n\n2. [Quad FMs meet in Australia for fourth summit](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/current-situation-at-lac-arisen-due-to-disregard-of-written-agreements-by-china-jaishankar-369243)\n\nForeign Ministers of the countries participating in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ("the Quad") - India, Japan, the US, and Australia - met in Melbourne for their fourth summit. Their joint statement and press conference tried its best, and failed, to show that the grouping was not against China. All the issues discussed - the weaponization of trade, sending warships into other countries\' territorial waters, repeatedly flying jets over Taiwan, pushing soldiers into across land borders, and neo-colonial economic tactics in developing countries - were essentially aimed at China even if the country was not mentioned by anyone but the US delegation. Indian EAM Jaishankar confirmed that China\'s activities on the LAC were discussed, although he hid direct criticism by describing it as "a large country that disregards its own written commitments."\n\n3. [US orders Ukrainian Embassy staff to leave](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-orders-employees-to-leave-embassy-in-kyiv-potential-russian-invasion-ukraine/)\n\nIn further signs that the US expects Russia to invade Ukraine in the coming weeks, it has ordered all non-essential staff in its embassy in Kyiv to leave the country as soon as possible. This follows hectic days of talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and an array of leaders ranging from US President Biden to French President Macron. The talks have yielded little, with Russia troops still massed along the eastern and norther borders of Ukraine. The US Congress is however, preparing a set of strong sanctions that would kick in the moment Russia launched an actual invasion - these sanctions would cut off Russia from the international banking system as well as from trade in high-end devices like semiconductors, effectively killing its two only major industries - oil and weapons. In a separate incident, it is reported that Macron refused to take a COVID-19 test in Moscow for fearing of Russia acquiring his DNA.\n\n4. [Sri Lanka comes to India after humiliation by China](https://www.eurasiareview.com/12022022-sri-lankas-fertilizer-sell-out-to-china-analysis/)\n\nThe government of Sri Lanka suffered a massive humiliation at the hands of China as it tried to implement its ridiculous organic farming policy. The country, which is facing economic collapse and a foreign exchange crisis, decided to import organic fertilizers worth $8 mn from China. However, when tested, the fertilizers were shown to have a microorganism that would damage the soil as an invasive species, and a court ordered payment to be cancelled even as the ship itself waited in dock. The Chinese embassy in Colombo then tweeted that if the payment did not go through, it would sanction the state-owned bank that facilitated the payment, a stunning humiliation. The government managed to find a way to pay off the money, although the fertilizer was never offloaded to Sri Lanka. Interestingly, some online detectives have reported that the ship changed its name and ID and offloaded the fertilizers in the Chinese-controlled port of  Hambantota. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\'s finance and foreign ministers came begging to New Delhi and received a $2.4 bn line of credit that helped it avoid a sovereign default on dollar-denominated bonds. In those meetings, they sung high praise for India as a partner. Interestingly, Sri Lanka is also believed to have secured a $200 mn line of credit from Pakistan!\n\n5. [Europe, US fight high inflation](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkey-lower-taxes-basic-foods-fight-high-inflation-82844588)\n\nSupply chain constraints induced by the pandemic, as well as massive government spending, have pushed up inflation all over the world, and particularly in the US and Europe. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose in January by 7.5%, the highest in 40 years, with everything from food to fuel being more expensive. Concurrently, President Biden\'s approval rating sank to about 30%, lower than Trump\'s ever was. In Denmark and the UK, the price of natural gas (required for winter heating) rose by around 50%, forcing those governments to implement price controls, subsidies, and rebates to quell domestic pressure. In Turkey, inflation is at around 50%, and the government has been forced to lower taxes on food and fuel. The Federal Reserve (America\'s central bank) has indicated that it will be raising interests rates, and the European Central Bank has indicated that it will follow. In Turkey however, President Erdogan\'s unique economic ideas have seen the central bank actually reducing interest rates, further pushing up inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Children of Sykes-Picot Part 2: The Arab Revolt\n\n *This is the second part of a series discussing the history of the countries in the Middle East that were born of the Sykes-Picot pact.* \n\n[Part 1: Background](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sg001q/rindiaspeaks_biweekly_geopolitics_thread_nato/)\n\nAs we saw in Part 1, at the dawn of World War I, the Arabs were a largely subdued and defeated minority within the much larger Ottoman Empire. As winds of nationalism swept through Europe in the preceding centuries, Ottoman rulers and even liberal reformists (the so-called Young Turks) reacted by pushing a pan-Islamism and pan-Turkish message: one religion (Islam) and one language (Turkish) to unite a diverse people. Arabs were not only conquered by an empire they help create, their culture was being wiped out as well. \n\nIn 1914, a European prince was assassinated, and Europe plunged into the Great War. On one side were England (with her vast empire in India and Africa to call upon for men), France, Italy, and Tsarist Russia, and on the other were Imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. WW1 was a war of attrition - a slow war in which the winner would be whichever side could survive the longest. And it was a deeply unpopular war, one being fought for no reason except to satisfy the egos of European royalty. The longer is lasted, the longer it was feared that popular uprisings would overthrow that royalty (as happened towards the end in Russia with the Bolshevik Revolution). Both sides were looking for some weakness to exploit to end the war. \n\nIn July 1915, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon (who is better known for drawing the Indo-Tibetan border, today\'s LAC), explored an interesting proposition. He wrote to Sharif Hussain bin Abi, the ruler of Mecca appointed by the Ottomans, about starting an uprising against Ottoman rule among Arabs, which would receive military support from British forces in Egypt as well as French forces. Egypt was not a colony of Britain in the same way India was, but rather it was a protectorate such that Britain controlled its armed forces and foreign policy, as well as the Suez Canal. In return for revolt, McMahon promised that Britain would recognize an independent Arab state, stretching from modern Syria through Iraq and all the way to Aden in Yemen, which was controlled by British India. Needless to say, Hussain bin Ali would be the king of the state. \n\nAli consulted with his sons, who were ceremonial "kings" of other Ottoman Arab provinces, and agreed. In 1916, with a symbolic shot of a rifle, Ali declared Arab independence from the Ottoman Empire even as Britain faced humiliating defeats in the main theatre of WW1. The Hashemite Army raised a [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Arab_Revolt) with black, white, green, and red colors colours, which remain the main colours of the flags of many modern Arab states in the region (though not Saudi Arabia). The Arab Revolt began with attacks on Ottoman garrisons in Mecca and Medina, as well as destruction of the Hejaz Railroad, the main logistical route for the Ottoman Sultan to send supplies and troops to the region. Soon enough, with the aid of the Royal Navy, the Arab revolutionaries captured the major port of Jeddah. Even Ali\'s Arab rivals, such as Ibn Saud, the ruler of the Najd (the interior, desert part of the Arabian peninsula that even the Ottomans had no interest in), joined the revolt. \n\nReinforcements from Egypt and India came as well, with the Indian troops being instrumental in the capture of Haifa in the Ottoman region of Palestine. British and French officers carefully worked with Ali\'s Hashemite Army to coordinate strategy and intelligence, the most famous officer being TE Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"). The Ottomans were in crisis: troops had to be pulled back from Europe to shore up defenses in Iraq, Palestine, and Hejaz, while at the same time the United States, the world\'s largest economy at that time, joined the war in Europe, dealing a further blow. Eventually, the Arab forces, backed by British and French-controlled troops, broke through Ottoman defenses. Jerusalem fell in 1917, and finally Damascus in 1918, and with that the Ottoman Empire sued for peace. \n\nWith the Armistice of Mudros, the Hashemite Army declared victory. The Sharif was declared the King of Syria, to eventually become the King of all Arabs, as promised by McMahon. The dream of an Arab homeland was finally within reach. Except, the British and French had other ideas. They had no intention of allowing a unified Arab state to be created. As we will see in Part 3, even as Ali and McMahon wrote letters to build their alliance, a different kind of future was being mapped out in secret.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *Have an interesting story from the world of geopolitics to share?

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Muslims'<br />Body: 'I have a feeling that Indian Muslims are being used as a fodder/weapon to settle scores against the BJP by the Indian opposition, Left Leaning media, basically lutyens Delhi. \n\nCase in point:- \n\n1) Hijab Issue:- Any sane liberal telling Hijab is a choice and not a symbol of oppression is just blatantly lying, if Hijab is a indigenous custom the same guys would be venomously against it, period. Refer Ghoongat. \n\nSecondly, Hijab issue was between 6-7 students with political links and the college management, a good consensus building between them would have solved that issue. If 6-7 students suddenly shave their heads bald or do something differently even then they would have been picked up, I was in my school when 4 of my friends and I decided to shave our heads bald. It’s school’s duty to ensure kids are not under any influence of a cult or a political outfit. \n\n2) TTT:- BJP banned TTT which directly empowers a Muslim woman. Banned in many Islamic countries, ironically even our Islamic neighbors. \n\n3) CAA NRC:- I’ve read the law of CAA, it DOES NOT DEAL WITH INDIANS, let alone Indian Muslims. The problem with many with CAA was NRC, what if GOVERNMENT brought NRC in a future date and would the two laws be linked to remove Muslims. \n\nAgain, that’s hypothetical, secondly, CAA categorically dealt with refugees already in India and not new people. Many argued that if a Hindu was not able to prove his origin under NRC, he would be protected using CAA, but if that said HINDU can’t prove himself to be a Hindu from India how would he prove that he is a Hindu refugee from Pakistan/Bangladesh or Afghanistan. The logical reasoning was absurd. \n\nAnd with scores of government benefits and subsidies given it’s impossible to buy the argument that people may not have documents to prove NRC. And people who do not avail government benefits would naturally be rich so they would have their documents anyway. \n\nAlso, the Bangladeshi illegal population in the country is truly a mess. Why would an Indian Muslim want a Bangladeshi illegal Muslim in the country ? So wouldn’t they also want such illegal citizens to be out ? \n\n4) Ram Mandir:- A mosque is also being rebuilt. A temple is also being rebuilt. My limited understanding of Islam, they do not have religious associates with structures like the Hindus. What happened in 91 was bad but isn’t this the best solution. Hindus get their holy land, Muslims get to rebuild the mosque. Win win ? Also, BJP despite being in power both Centre and State, went with the SC verdict and not an ordinance route, why are they even being credited for it ? \n\n5) abrogation Article 370: - again a law that has so many fallacies. Women not getting equal rights, Dalits not having voting rights and what not. The laws denied Kashmir a chance to modernization like rest of India. Why would an average Indian Muslim be unhappy with it . \n\nPS:- Muslims can continue to hate BJP, they have all the right to do so. It could be the hate speeches and blatant visual  saffron the BJP likes to wear up its sleeve but are they really anti Muslim ? Do the media and the opposition really care for the Muslims or are they largely using them to bring down BJP ?'<br />Author: 'sachinsourav02'  id: 'srjk2j'<br />Score:180<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srjk2j/indian_muslims/</li>

Hussain\'s past association with Muslim Brotherhood-connected entities raises major questions about the type of outreach he envisions for the Muslim world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The *Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Report* [took a look](http://globalmbreport.com/?p=2173) at Hussain\'s official biography and found several concerning affiliations. The first is that **in October 2000, Hussain spoke at a conference sponsored by the Association of Muslim Social Scientists, which was listed in an internal Muslim Brotherhood document as one of "our organizations and the organizations of our friends," and the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding of Georgetown University, which receives Saudi funding and is directed by prominent Muslim Brotherhood**[**advocate,**](http://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.1737/pub_detail.asp) **John Esposito.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**In September 2004, Hussain played a role in the Muslim Students Association\'s annual conference, which was founded by Muslim Brotherhood in 1963 and is also listed as one the group\'s fronts in its own** [**documents.**](http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/misc/20.pdf) **Since then, many of its nearly 600 college chapters have engaged in** [**extremism**](http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/misc/84.pdf) **and the group closely collaborates with the other Brotherhood fronts. For example, MSA was part of an umbrella organization called the American Muslim Taskforce that led a** [**campaign**](http://www.aina.org/news/20090402103323.jsp) **against the FBI\'s use of informants in mosques and accused the agency of "anti-Muslim activity." Several Brotherhood affiliates are in this** [**coalition**](http://www.americanmuslimvoter.net/images/special/ABOUT%20US%20AMT2008.pdf) **including the Muslim-American Society, the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**At this conference, Hussain spoke alongside the daughter of Professor Sami Al-Arian, who was convicted of being a key leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group and later admitted to being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hussain also defended Al-Arian and described his prosecution as being a "politically-motivated persecution." The network of Brotherhood-affiliated groups have consistently been on his side throughout the entire ordeal and** [**celebrated**](http://www.islamist-watch.org/blog/2008/09/cair-mpac-hail-release-of-jihadist-professor) **his release.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Interestingly, the story in The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs that quoted Hussain\'s defense of Al-Arian has been altered since its original publication.*** ***CNSNews.com*** [***reports***](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/61324) ***that the quote was removed "sometime after October 2007" and that the reporter who wrote the article "expressed surprise but said she no longer worked at WRMEA and could not explain the edit."***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Last May, Hussain spoke at a conference sponsored by several Brotherhood affiliates, including the Muslim Public Affairs Council, an organization whose extremism has been catalogued in a** [**series**](http://www.investigativeproject.org/1785/mpac-pursues-islamist-ideology-in-guise-of-civil) **by The Investigative Project on Terrorism, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The latter was listed by the federal government in 2007 as an "unindicted co-conspirator" in the terrorism financing trial of The Holy Land Foundation, another Muslim Brotherhood front that was found to be financing Hamas. Its founders are former officials at the Islamic Association of Palestine, a Brotherhood front shut down for supporting Hamas and are said by the FBI to be members of the Brotherhood\'s "Palestine Committee" in the United States.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hussein opposes making democracy promotion a central part of that goal, saying that it can be interpreted as imperialism and an attempt to bring about freedom that enables immorality, but admits that it may be part of the solution. He instead suggests that the government use Muslim voices to argue that Islam forbids acts of terrorism and extremism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One other important part of his paper is when he proposes that the U.S. build a Muslim coalition "not limited to those who advocate Western-style democracy, and avoid creating a dichotomy between freedom and Islamic society." This would set the stage for a partnership with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rather than focusing on supporting elements that will genuinely argue that democracy is compatible with Islam, his standard for allies is that they just oppose terrorism and extremism.

      <li>Title::: '5 Sutras of the Powerful Political Treatise Chanakya Niti to follow in your life'<br />Body: " As we all know, [Acharya Chanakya](https://www.sanatandharmi.com/2021/12/chanakya-niti-for-success.html) also known as Kautilya or Vishnugupt was one of the most prominent philosophers and politicians of Ancient India. Along with it, he was also an economist, jurist and the royal advisor of King Chandragupt Maurya; the founder of Mauryan empire.\n\nHe has been credited for building the Mauryan empire and been appraised for his commendable role in the establishment of Maurya empire.\xa0\n\nHe wrote several books on subjects such as Economy, Politics, Daily Life situations, War strategies, Leadership and Management.\xa0\n\nSome of the notable works of him are Arthashastra, a book on Money, Politics, Military strategies and Wealth management. [Chanakya Niti](https://www.sanatandharmi.com/2021/12/chanakya-niti-for-success.html), a collection of meaningful quotes and verses from certain Shastras.\n\nAcharya Chanakya was one of the most intelligent leaders and founding fathers of Maurya Empire. His given lessons and teachings are still relevant in today's life.\xa0\n\nHe was a teacher in the Taxila University. At that time, the Nanda Dynasty was ruling the majority of India. But the dynasty had very incompetent rulers.\xa0\n\nWhen Chanakya saw that the army of Alexander was coming to invade India, he went to the court of King Dhanananda and warned him about this danger.\n\nKing Dhanananda ignored his advise and instead insulted him. Seeing the ego of King, Chanakya became very furious and decided that now he will raise a king from his side and overthrow this ignorant king.\xa0\n\nAfter that Chanakya met Chandragupta Maurya, the first king of Maurya empire, who was a teenager at that time. He taught Chandragupta all the Strategies, Military lessons and subjects to him and raised him as the new ruler of India.\n\nHe defeated King Dhanananda and established the Maurya Empire over India. Thus he also fought against the army of Alexander and defeated them thus securing India from foreign invaders.\n\nThe strategies and lessons which he applied at that time are still relevant today and one can apply them in his/her life to achieve success in various fields.\n\n **Sutras of Chanakya**\n\n1) Just as a mirror reflects a mans face, his personality is reflected in his company of friends. One must always be careful in making friendships and acquaintances, for one’s friends, are in a way, an extension of one’s inner nature and tendencies.\n\n2)\xa0Before you start some work always ask yourselves three questions why I am doing it, what the results might be and will I be\xa0successful. Only when you think deeply and find satisfactory answers to these questions, go ahead.\xa0\n\n3)\xa0Knowledge is lost without putting it into practice; a man is lost due to ignorance; an army is lost without a commander; and a woman is lost without a husband."<br />Author: 'sanatandharmi'  id: 'srfuzo'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srfuzo/5_sutras_of_the_powerful_political_treatise/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The brutally effective whitewashing machinery of Congress and how it always shifts the blame towards the Hindus after every terrorist attack'<br />Body: '# Case 1 – Successful Whitewashing - The Godhra riots and the targeted attempt to shift the blame solely upon the Hindus.\n\nOn 27th February 2002, a mob of 2000 Muslims descended on the Sabarmati express and lighted the coach number **S-6 on fire killing a total of 60 people including 10 children.** Why was compartment number S-6 targeted? Because it was full of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya. No other coach was targeted, making this a per-meditated attack that is all but forgotten today.\n\nBecause if you raise the topic of 2002, most people will say “Modi!” as a reflex. The whitewashing has been so efficient that even the so called Hindutva brigades on the internet will regularly make fun of it to the extent of making comments like –\n\n***“I miss 2002 Modi.”***\n\n***“Why won’t Modi handle XYZ situation like 2002?”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is how deep the whitewashing has resulted in.\n\nPeople conveniently forgot that the mob was more than 2000 strong. People conveniently forget that 60 people were burned alive inside the train compartment. People conveniently forget that these train compartments were locked from the outside before they were lit on fire by pouring petrol all over it. \n\nFinally, people conveniently forget that not one of the mastermind of the attack really faced any real punishment – in any way shape or form.\n\nPeople also conveniently forget that all the subsequent riots that took place were a form of retaliation after people heard the news of charred Hindus burned inside the train compartment. \n\nAnd thus the whitewashing began.\n\nDocumentaries were made illegally showing the plight of only the one community, conveniently ignoring the Hindu plight. Hindus suffered just as much in the riots, but they never were interviewed. And even if they were, none of it reached the widespread media.\n\nAuthors were recruited and they wrote books about how Narendra Modi orchestrated the riots. Cases filed against him in courts all over India. This was a concerted effort to show Modi as the bogeyman who brought this riots upon the very state he was the CM of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid Narendra Modi light fire to the train compartment of Sabarmati Express that killed 60 Hindu pilgrims? No.\n\nWere all of the 2000 strong terrorists apprehended and punished according to the full extent of the law? No.\n\nThen where is the justice really? And how is Modi responsible for 2002? How come he has been made the conspirator of the riots? The logic behind this blame shifting is nefarious to say the least.\n\n# \n\n# Case 2 – Semi-successful whitewashing - The Pulwama Attacks and the subsequent gaslighting about how this was conducted by the Indian Government and not Pakistani terrorists –\n\nOn 14th February a jeep laden with RDX ploughed through the checkpoint and into CRPF’s convoy and exploded, killing 40 CRPF jawans. \n\nFawad Chaudhary, a senior Pakistani Minister exposed himself by claiming that Pakistan orchestrated the attacks by saying – “Hindustan mein ghus ke maara unko.”\n\nNIA investigations revealed that the terrorist was from the terrorist group Jaish-E-Mohammad and the attack was planned in Pakistan.\n\nThe whitewashing here was planned by Prince Pappu himself. Apparently, he alleged that it was the BJP government that benefited from the attack. Here is his tweet – \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 8g9gmkfbtkh81...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe conspiracy spread wide on Twitter with tweets like this. Notice how Godhra is being equated with Pulwama –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ox6ousmctkh81...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to these two, Chattisgarh Congress CM **Bhupesh Baghel**, spokesperson **Devashish Jarariya**, Goa Congress leader **Chellakumar**, Congress MP from Karnataka **B K Hariprasad**, Congress leader **Digvijay Singh** – all released official statements alleging BJP to be the mastermind behind the Pulwama attacks. \n\nIn any other fair political scenario, he and all these Congressi rats would have been taken apart by all sides of the media, but it was not so. Here are the conspiracies that were peddled –\n\n***"How did 300 kilos of RDX reach the CRPF convoy?"***\n\n***"This was a “false flag” attack done by BJP/RSS to gain political points before election."***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these conspiracy theories were laid flat by Pakistani confession, but the Congress leadership remains belligerent.\n\n**Shashi Tharoor has famously said that – “there is nothing to apologise for.”**, even after his party members spread lies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRahul Gandhi has not yet deleted the conspiracy tweet. No expectations from him, since he was dancing after the Pulwama attacks anyway. Here is the video –\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video xbeqooy2ukh81...*\n\nThe Pulwama attack conspiracies are still spread today. \n\nThe extent of this whitewashing is that if someone brings up a terrorist attack that takes place in any part of India, the response is –\n\n&gt;***“Election time obviously. A way to distract from usual issues.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Case 3 – Failed whitewashing – 26/11 attacks and Congress conspiracy of BJP/RSS behind the attacks –\n\nOn 26th of November 2008, 10 Lashkar terrorists sneaked their way into Mumbai through the sea and unleashed a brutal wave of violence in which over 175 people were killed and over 300 injured.\n\nThe famous Ajmal Kasab was apprehended due to the heroics of constable Tukaram Omble.\n\nKasab basically blew open the whole plan and revealed how his handlers were from Pakistan and the whole plot was masterminded by Pakistani terror groups.\n\nNot just this, but even Nawaz Sharif, the former Pakistan PM let it slip that Pakistani government has a role to play in planning these attacks.\n\nBut attempts to whitewash even this was not paused by Congress. A full 2 years after all the terror plans were revealed to the general public, Digvijay Singh came out and helped promote a book that claimed that 26/11 attacks were a RSS planned conspiracy.\n\nThe book promotion was attended by **Congress MLA Kripashanker Singh**, **SP MLA Abu Azmi**, former **IGP S M Mushrif** and **Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 86v40o2jvkh81...*\n\nIt is to be noted that Mahesh Bhatt’s son Rahul Bhatt aided David Headley in the recoinnasance of Mumbai city. David Headly then passed on the recon report to LeT headquarters in Pakistan which provided the blueprint of the terror attacks later.\n\nCongress president Sonia Gandhi has not apologized for Digvijay’s involvement in the book promotion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis type of whitewash was a complete failure because of just one thing – Tukaram Omble’s heroic sacrifice in capturing Kasab alive, because the identity card in Kasab’s pocket read – \n\n&gt;**Samir Dinesh Chaudhari, student of Arunodaya Degree and P.G. College, Vedre Complex, Dilkhushnagar, Hyderabad, 500060, resident of 254, Teachers’ Colony, Nagarabhavi, Bengaluru, 500060**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis seems like a plan hatched by the Congress with their buddies in Pakistan that failed because Kasab was captured. Otherwise you could be sure as hell that they would have pinned the blame on BJP/RSS for sure.\n\nFun Fact - Aziz Burney, who authored that book was appointed a delegate by the then PM Manmohan Singh for official visits to France and Egypt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The effects of such whitewashing is all around us –\n\nEven in Hindu safe spaces like here, I have seen it.\n\nAfter Mamta and TMC butchered BJP workers in West Bengal, what was the reaction of the so called Hindutva supporters? \n\nI will tell you – \n\n***"Modi is at fault."***\n\n***"Maulana Modi."***\n\n***"Cuckendra Modi."***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid Modi direct these attacks on his party workers? The one who gave the orders were TMC leaders. TMC party workers were complicit, but here’s the symptom of being whitewashed by these conspiracy tactics – even the Hindu supporters blamed Modi and not Mamta.\n\nIn stark comparison, when 2002 happened, did the Muslims curse their leaders? Nope. They called Modi “maut ka saudagar”.\n\nIn comparison, Mamta Banerjee after the post-election violence was nicknamed “didi o didi”.\n\nThis is the real extent of precipitation of these tactics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there is a conspiracy, it is this – \n\nAccording to conservative reports that seem under reported, there have been over 800 instances of Islamic terrorist attacks in India until 2019. \n\nOf these 800, only 25 attacks happened post 2014 during BJP’s reign, and almost all of them are concentrated in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe rest of the 750 odd Islamic terrorist attacks took place during Congress rule and took place across the country, in almost every state you name.\n\nThe stats do not lie.\n\nThe stats actually beg the question – is Congress hand in glove with Islamic terrorists from Pakistan. Either this, or they really do not care about national security and let these attacks happen due to shoddy management.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNamaste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources - \n\nHow the chief mastermind behind the Sabarmati Train burning died in a hospital and how his death penalty was commuted by the Gujarat High Court into life imprisonment –\n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/2002-godhra-train-burning-case-convict-dies-in-hospital-during-treatment-in-vadodara/articleshow/87947168.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/2002-godhra-train-burning-case-convict-dies-in-hospital-during-treatment-in-vadodara/articleshow/87947168.cms?from=mdr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRahul Gandhi alleging that BJP benefitted from the Pulwama attacks –\n\n[https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1228168595282071555?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1228168595282071555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongress MP BK Hariprasad also spreads conspiracy behind Pulwama attacks –\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2019/03/karnataka-congress-mp-calls-pulwama-terrorist-attack-a-match-fixing-between-pm-modi-and-pakistan/](https://www.opindia.com/2019/03/karnataka-congress-mp-calls-pulwama-terrorist-attack-a-match-fixing-between-pm-modi-and-pakistan/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoa Congress leader says Pulwama attacks planned by Modi –\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/InGoa24x7/videos/379786232820447/](https://www.facebook.com/InGoa24x7/videos/379786232820447/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCongress spokesperson Devashish Jarariya saying Pulwama attacks was a planned conspiracy –\n\n[https://twitter.com/sanjukta/status/1096098614621818880?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/sanjukta/status/1096098614621818880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRahul Gandhi’s paramour Sanjukta Basu calling it a conspiracy –\n\n[https://twitter.com/sanjukta/status/1096098614621818880?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/sanjukta/status/1096098614621818880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRahul Gandhi dancing after the Pulwama attacks –\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2019/02/congress-deletes-video-where-rahul-gandhi-was-seen-dancing-after-the-pulwama-attack/](https://www.opindia.com/2019/02/congress-deletes-video-where-rahul-gandhi-was-seen-dancing-after-the-pulwama-attack/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel says BJP behind Pulwama attacks –\n\n[https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/on-2nd-anniversary-of-pulwama-chhattisgarh-cm-alleges-conspiracy-behind-attack20210214120642/](https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/on-2nd-anniversary-of-pulwama-chhattisgarh-cm-alleges-conspiracy-behind-attack20210214120642/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis 2010 Indian Express report on Digvijay Singh doing multiple press conferences across India promoting the 26/11 RSS conspiracy book –\n\n[https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/rss-26-11-digvijaya-flags-it-off-again-this-time-in-mumbai/](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/rss-26-11-digvijaya-flags-it-off-again-this-time-in-mumbai/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAziz Burney, the author of that book was invited by Congress PM Manmohan Singh as an official delegate to France and Egypt –\n\n[https://www.opindia.com/2020/11/aziz-burneys-26-11-rss-ki-saazish-read-how-the-urdu-journalist-got-congress-patronage-manmohan-singh/](https://www.opindia.com/2020/11/aziz-burneys-26-11-rss-ki-saazish-read-how-the-urdu-journalist-got-congress-patronage-manmohan-singh/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStatistics on Islamic terrorist attacks around the world –\n\n[https://www.fondapol.org/en/study/islamist-terrorist-attacks-in-the-world-1979-2019/](https://www.fondapol.org/en/study/islamist-terrorist-attacks-in-the-world-1979-2019/)'<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'srftr2'<br />Score:977<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/srftr2/the_brutally_effective_whitewashing_machinery_of/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Opposing hijab is a good thing. But I think it's being done for wrong reasons."<br />Body: "We can't really be 100% secular in schools/colleges. We shouldn't aim at creating an environment where there is no sign of any religious traditions in our schools. Rather we've to ensure that students have some ways through which they can express their religious/caste based identity.  \n\n\nA school's uniform rules may cover footwear and hair styles too. A turban wearing Sikh student or a student donating hair at Tirupati or a brahmin student leaving a Shikha or a student not wearing any footwear as he has taken Shabarimale Maala etc-  all these give out one's religious or caste based identities. Under the name of uniform, a school shouldn't bar any of such students from entering the campus/class. Same logic applies to Hijab. Hijab won't violate the uniform rules. It's just a minor addition or enhancement. Every caste or community has such modifications.  \n\n\nOn that basis, a girl wearing hijab has every right to enter classroom as any other student with similar modifications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut burka on the other hand is entirely different thing. Covering one's body from head to toe defeats the whole purpose of uniform. Such things should be banned.  \n\n\nRemember the Keshavananda Bharathi Case? State can amend constitution but not to such an extent that it changes the basic structure. The same can be applied to uniforms. Students can make minor modifications according to their traditions but shouldn't go beyond a certain boundary. And hijab falls within this minimum. But not Burkha.  \n\n\nHaving said all this, I still find hijab to be a very special case. I can't remember any other tradition that is as divided as hijab. Context matters and under some cases hijab is a symbol of oppression and in some cases a choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHijab representing a community is a secondary effect. It's primary goal is to maintain a woman's modesty, it is projected as an act of great virtue and righteousness, a practice to ensure they conceal their beauty so no harm can come to them. This is the most problematic thing for me. The notion that responsibility falls on women to cover their faces so that they don't draw any unnecessary attention and thereby remain safe. Such a flawed logic is twisted as a religious practice and projected as a community's right to express their religion. And such a thing needs to be exercised in schools... schools were our future generations are sculpted. We've to begin with the assumption that schools are not safe for women that they need such coverings, that the teenage boys who may occasionally gaze at Muslim women do so cos they're all potential sexual predators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuch an illogical practice doesn't necessarily have to be forced upon Muslim women. They can be very conveniently conditioned into thinking that they find it very happy to follow that. All children seek for approval from their parents, in-laws, neighbors etc, - ppl whom they interact frequently. If such interactions reinforce the use of Barkha/veil/hijab and young girls are always celebrated when they use them, then of course you'll end up with a generation of women who feel very **proud** to conceal themselves.  \n\n\nI had a weird thought experiment. Imagine a whole continent full of blind men. Still there happens a lot of sexual attacks on women. There comes a new religion and it has a solution to this. Since no man can see, the problem must be that women make sound when they speak and this sound triggers men and makes them commit violent acts on women. So the signs of a virtuous women is that she always keeps silent, never makes any sort of sound and goes as far as covering her mouth with a tape. Any woman who wants to speak will be seen as not respecting the practices of her religion. The practices that are there only to protect her. When such girls go to schools and schools demand that they speak when they're spoken to, they cry oppression. That staying silent is their choice and their freedom is being violated by making them speak. In a distant country, women naturally want to speak, but their religion doesn't allow that. Those women are protesting for their right to speak and celebrities, activists, journalists are all supporting their cause there. But the same ppl, also demand here that schools can't make  rules against women's choice to stay silent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf all Muslim boys want to wear skull caps to schools, or all muslim women want to wear a specific style of bangles/mehandi/or any such things, it'd have been very easy. No issues with any such things. But hijab is a discounted version of burkha. Still we can give the benefit of doubt to the practice and let it continue in schools. But what's the guarantee that their demands stop at hijab and whatever arguments they're making in support of hijab won't be extended for other more extreme versions?"<br />Author: 'SambarDip'  id: 'sreyzb'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sreyzb/opposing_hijab_is_a_good_thing_but_i_think_its/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'India’s Journey into The Free Trade Agreement'<br />Body: 'India has been signing free trade agreements with many countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and United Arab Emirates.\n\n# But apparently, there is a difference between FTA and CECA:\n\n“Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA): These terms describe agreements which consist of an integrated package on goods, services and investment along with other areas including IPR, competition etc. The India Korea CEPA is one such example and it covers a broad range of other areas like trade facilitation and customs cooperation, investment, competition, IPR etc.”\n\n“Free Trade Agreement (FTA): In FTAs, tariffs on items covering substantial bilateral trade are eliminated between the partner countries; however, each maintains individual tariff structure for non-members. India Sri Lanka FTA is an example. The key 2 difference between an FTA and a PTA is that while in a PTA there is a positive list of products on which duty is to be reduced; in an FTA there is a negative list on which duty is not reduced or eliminated. Thus, compared to a PTA, FTAs are generally more ambitious in coverage of tariff lines (products) on which duty is to be reduced.\\^”\n\n\\^Officially called the “Decision on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries”, and adopted under GATT in 1979.\n\n# Let’s travel to the history. (Sits on ICF and alights at Lucknow)\n\nI gave a clue in the previous line. You are right if you thought of Atalji.\n\nAtalji mooted the idea of having such a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement and decided to approach one of its friends whom it can rely on. That is Singapore.\n\nHere’s a link from the Government of Singapore Prime Minister Office’s website:\n\n[https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/DPM-Heng-Swee-Keat-at-the-Confederation-of-India-Industry-Annual-Meeting](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/DPM-Heng-Swee-Keat-at-the-Confederation-of-India-Industry-Annual-Meeting)\n\nHeng Swee Keat was the Chief Negotiator of the CECA who stated that CECA  started under Atalji and was signed three years later under the prime minister Manmohan Singh.\n\nAn idea started by Atalji resulted in the new era of India-Singapore relations.\n\nHere are some of the infographics by the Singapore Government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.mti.gov.sg\\/Improving-Trade\\/Free-Trade-Agreements\\/CECA](https://preview.redd.it/vtwq7qvn6dh81.png?width=1375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=397d74e5d91fc4beccbf38cf3bf138950d378082)\n\n[https://www.mti.gov.sg/Improving-Trade/Free-Trade-Agreements/CECA](https://www.mti.gov.sg/Improving-Trade/Free-Trade-Agreements/CECA)\n\nFrom then on, India has signed many more agreements with other countries.\n\nThey are namely South Korea, Canada, Malaysia, Finland, Argentina, Colombia, Africa, Chile and Ecuador.\n\nFTAs are crucial. Let’s go through each points:\n\n1)  Tariffs concession\n\nSingapore CECA:\n\nTariffs for plastics, early harvest programe, food products, electronics, pharmaceuticals and machinery and mechincal appliances have seen either zero or reduction in tariff. The number in Singapore government puts the following:\n\n“Tariff reduction/elimination for 81% of Singapore’s exports to India make Singapore-originating products more competitive and allow Singapore exporters to increase their exports to India’s large consumer market. Products that benefit include food products, plastics, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and mechanical appliances.\n\nIndia has enhanced its market access commitments for Singapore service providers. These commitments provide Singapore services companies with an opportunity to build market expertise and grow by international expansion. The sectors with enhanced commitments include finance, engineering, tourism, logistics, construction, medical, research and development and computer services.”\n\nThis means we can see more exports from India in those sectors mentioned and the businesses will not need to incur costs such as custom duty or tariff costs. This means it’s good news for the businesses and consumers.\n\n2) Employment Opportunities \n\nThis means that both country’s citizen can have access to the talent pool they have in each country. For example, Singapore had 97,000 Singapore Citizens employed in 2019 by Singapore-based companies that invested in India.\n\nIndian Nationals too have enjoyed good work experience in Singapore by working in key sectors like ICT, Finance Sector and Service sector like Constructions.\n\nHowever, the key barrier remains which is immigration rules. It is not possible to enter a country just like that.\n\n3) Safeguard businesses in overseas markets\n\nThe legal rights of businesses will be protected. The intellectual property rights will be enhanced and there will be avenue for recourse.\n\nFor instance, let’s take Subway. No one can copy Subway logo or name in any way. If Tata is to operate in Bangladesh, then it should ensure no one copies Tata logo or name.\n\n4) Barriers to entry\n\nFree market is categorized into four categories, monopolistic, perfect competition, oligopoly and monopolistic competition. There is no such things such as perfect competition.\n\nIf we look at aviation, India had to liberise the aviation sector in the 1990s so that someone can give a competition to Air India. Result? Consumers had a win-win situation. Slowly, since 2005, ever since Indigo has entered the market the market has become even more fierce.\n\nOften governments have to call in foreign companies to break the monopoly. \n\nWith this, it can take time for the governments to conclude FTA as India is a big country and has many sectors. Certain sectors would want to practice protectionist measures. Government can understand this sentiment. An example would be the defense sector. \n\nTherefore, it is good that the Modi Government has been pursuing the CECA not FTA. This ensures that there can be more exports in other sectors and spread the “Make in India” word around the globe.'<br />Author: 'LankyAcanthocephala3'  id: 'sre144'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sre144/indias_journey_into_the_free_trade_agreement/</li>

The kingdom of Sekhari Vamsam, was divided into Thenmalappuram, Vadamalappuram and Naduvattam. And each were managed by different hereditary governers under the king. Today's Palakkad stands in the middle of Vadamalappuram, which was a thick forest and consisted of twenty-three parts.\n\nPalakkad had a strong relationship with the Shakteya Hindu culture. The family gods (Devatas) of Shekari Vamsam were Neeli and Kali. They also worshipped Nāgadevatas. The Rajas also encouraged and patronized the festivals of Pooram and Vela, for example, the Kannampara Vela, Nemmara-Vallangi Vela, and Kavassery Pooram. They had also built some temples in Palakkad. In 1452AD, the then ruler Itti Kombi Achan commissioned most famous one, which was the grand Viswanathaswamy temple which was built in Dravidian style. The famous Kalpathy Ratholsavam(Chariot festival) is centred around this temple.\n\nIt's partly because of this dynasty that Palakkad became an TamBrahm hotspot in Kerala. The local story goes that one of the rulers fell in love with one of the hill tribal girls and married her and gave her titles like Ammachi which was reserved for Nair woman. Since marrying a women of 'polluting caste' was seen as a grave sin, the Namboothiris left the kingdom and as a result Iyer Brahmins from nearby Tamil kingdoms had to be brought to do rituals and run temples.\n\nThe eldest member of the royal family had the title Sekhari Varma Raja. The second in age was called Ilaya Raja, the third Kavassery Raja, the fourth Thalam Thamburan, and the fifth Thari Pootha Mura Raja. Along with their personal name they used the surname Menon too. Thus colloquially they were called as Shekari Menons or Shekari Varmas.The male members of the royal family were addressed respectfully as Achan and the female members as Nethiyar. The kings had a distinct type of crown which was brought out on Coronation and on special occasions. In this century also coronation ceremonies takes place although not accompanied with the grandeur it had years before."<br />Author: 'Cheralatron7'  id: 'sqs46w'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sqs46w/palakkad_achanmar_of_tharoor_swaroopam/</li>

The boys start, offended by the fact that only the Muslim girls claim harassment, denying the charges. In a couple of days, the Hindu girls also join the Hindu boys, accepting that there was no religion based discriminatory practice. From the next day Hindu organisations unite, ABVP comes into the picture. The first counter protests to seek equality begins.

Harassing the Hindu and Muslim students is stupid.\n2. From an Islamic point of view, [Hijab IS obligatory for all Muslim women](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47569/is-hijab-compulsory-in-islam).\n3. [Harsh Mander and the Indian American Muslim Council attended a Congressional hearing](https://www.siasat.com/islamophobia-taking-most-lethal-form-in-india-noam-chomsky-harsh-mander-2273903/) to demand action against India, including sanctions for denying the Muslims basic human rights.\n4. Only slave women and sex slaves are not allowed / do not need to wear the hijab or burqa. \\[[1](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47569/is-hijab-compulsory-in-islam)\\]\\[[2](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13646/confused-about-women-covering-their-faces)\\]\n\nWhat are my opinions?\n\n1. A direct ban on hijab will be difficult to enforce, and lead to more International calls for sanctions on India. This is terrible for our image and impacts the job creation prospects of all citizens of the country, irrespective of religion.\n2. There are numerous colleges that allow the Hijab and even the Burqa in Udupi. If religion is important, the Muslimahs should consider getting a TC to these places instead of changing the rules of the current college. The college can also consider giving the Muslims a special privilege (which they consider a right) to diffuse the situation. No opinions about that in particular.\n3. Fact number 4 is a problem. The non Muslims are not sex slaves or dishonorable for not wearing the Hijab (the CFI campaigned like this insulting those who did not). They should not be openly defamed this way. Muslimahs instead should sign an affidavit claiming that they don't agree with the Fact #4, but that is doubtful, since it is part of their faith. But some compromises may need to be made to live amicably.\n4. This is not a Hindu battle. Hindus should have simply ignored this entirely. If Muslims align themselves closer to Islam, Hindus will not be able to do anything. One can't force the two to unite under a roof.\n5. Islamic fundamentalism is not new in coastal Karnataka and Malabar. The metamorphosis that is seen here among young Muslimahs here was also seen before among other Muslim groups and will be seen in the future. The Muslims should not like to see more Bhatkal brothers propping up."<br />Author: 'sarthak_ganguly'  id: 'sqmoij'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sqmoij/hijab_rights_and_conerns/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'BR Amebdkar on the Purdah system (and a surprise link with "Love Jihad")'<br />Body: 'Excerpt from the book "Pakistan or Partition of India" by BR Amebdkar.\n\n&gt;There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in\nIndia is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu\nSociety. Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the\nHindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory\nsystem of Purdah for Muslim women.\n\n&gt;As a consequence of the Purdah system a segregation of the Muslim\nwomen is brought about. The ladies are not expected to visit the\nouter rooms, varandahs or gardens, their quarters are in the\nback-yard. All of them, young and old, are conﬁned in the same\nroom. No male servant can work in their presence.  A woman is\nallowed to see only her sons, brothers, father, uncles and\nhusband, or any other near relation who may be admitted to a\nposition of trust. She cannot go even to the mosque to pray and\nmust wear burka (veil) whenever she has to go out.  These burka\nwomen walking in the streets is one of the most hideous sights one\ncan witness in India. Such seclusion cannot but have its\ndeteriorating effects upon the physical constitution of Muslim\nwomen. They are usually victims to anaemia, tuberculosis and\npyorrhoea. Their bodies are deformed, with their backs bent, bones\nprotruded, hands and feet crooked. Ribs, joints and nearly all\ntheir bones ache. Heart palpitation is very often present in\nthem. The result of this pelvic deformity is untimely death at the\ntime of delivery. Purdah deprives Muslim women of mental and moral\nnourishment. Being deprived of healthy social life, the process of\nmoral degeneration must and does set in. Being completely secluded\nfrom the outer world, they engage their minds in petty family\nquarrels with the result that they become narrow anti restricted\nin their out-look.\n\n&gt;They lag behind their sisters from other communities, cannot take\npart in any out-door activity and are weighed down by a slavish\nmentality and an inferiority complex. They have no desire for\nknowledge, because they are taught not to be interested in\nanything outside the four walls of the house.  Purdah women in\nparticular become helpless, timid, and unfit for any fight in\nlife. Considering the lar e number of purdah women among Muslims\nin India, one can‘ asily understand the vastness and seriousness\nof the problem of purdah.\n\n&gt;The physical and intellectual effects of Purdah are nothing as\ncompared with its effects on morals. The origin of purdah lies of\ncourse in the deep—rooted suspicion of sexual appetites in both\nsexes and the purpose is to check them by segregating the\nsexes. But far from achieving,the purpose, purdah has adversely\naffected the morals of Muslim men. Owing to purdah a Muslim has no\ncontact with any woman outside those who belong to his own\nhousehold. Even with them his contact extends only to occasional\nconversation. For a male there is no company of and no comingling\nwith the females except those who are children or aged. This\nisolation of the males from females is sure to produce bad effects\non the morals of men. It requires no psychoanalyst to say that a\nsocial system which cuts off all contact between the two sexes\nproduces an unhealthy tendency towards sexual excesses and\nunnatural and other morbid habits and ways.\n\n&gt;The evil consequences of purdah are not conﬁned to the Muslim\ncommunity only. It is responsible for the social segregation of\nHindus from Muslims which is the bane of public life in\nIndia. This argument may appear far fetched and one is inclined to\nattribute this segregation to the unsociability of the Hindus\nrather than to purdah among the Muslims. But the Hindus are right\nwhen they say that it is not possible to establish social contact\nbetween Hindus and Muslims because such contact can only mean\ncontact between women from one side and men from the other.'<br />Author: 'indopasta'  id: 'sq7csi'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sq7csi/br_amebdkar_on_the_purdah_system_and_a_surprise/</li>

In Goa Hindu, Muslim, Christians all are bound with the same law related to marriage, divorce, succession.\n\nA bit of flashback March 2021,\n\n# Chief Justice of India S A Bobde lauds Uniform Civil Code in Goa\n\n“Goa has what Constitutional framers envisaged for India – a Uniform Civil Code. And I have had the great privilege of administering justice under that Code. It applies in marriage and succession, governing all Goans irrespective of religious affiliation.

Justice to all is a far more satisfactory way of dispensing justice than justice from case to case. The Court has its limitations and cannot embark the activist role of providing a civil code. The Parliament has to step in and initiate the process of enacting the UCC by appointing a committee, and/or, making a reference to the Law Commission." \n\n"A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so," he elaborated. \n\nhttps://www.republicworld.com/india-news/law-and-order/allahabad-hc-asserts-uniform-civil-code-is-mandatorily-required-asks-centre-to-act.html\n\nAnother look back Jan 2022,\n\n# Supreme Court gives Centre \'last chance\' to clarify UCC stand\n\nThe apex court had earlier issued notice on a PIL for enforcement of UCC while entertaining two separate PILs seeking uniform divorce laws and uniformity in grant of maintenance and alimony to women, and sought the Centre\'s response.

      <li>Title::: 'Are we losing the Narrative War? And What can we do about it?'<br />Body: "What I've learnt historically and politically is that winners write history, and it's not about how right you are but what you're portraying. The Indian 'right' is always portrayed as an echochamber and a cut out from the rest because of a few reasons which is firstly that the overwhelming amount of influencers (who, believe it or not, have a huge impact on how the youth thinks) are liberal and left-leaning. This might be because of many major artist management firms having tie-ups with parties (OML ex-CEO wanted to join AAP, for instance) and that's why you won't see them supporting any law that comes out, and secondly the image of Indians already is on the 'evil' side and this has been going on for a long time (Indian man = rapist) and this only increases no matter how evolved we become (Thanks to people like Vir Das who just couldn't help spewing the poison against our people).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring CAA/NRC, anyone who knew even one bit of Indian history would have pointed out that the rule made perfect sense, yet celebrities like Hasan Minhaj and John Oliver have a WHOLE SHOW and directly compare India to Nazi Germany. Now you might think they're absolutely wrong and there's no basis for comparison blah blah. International image matters, and this is ruining it. No matter how much you call it out, or how much you think it's the 'liberal funding'. What's stopping the right from using the same? Some footballer who a huge chunk of youth follows tweets about the non-sensical burkha in school issue which is now made out to be h!ndu oppression over the minority. It's really easy to figure out what they're trying to do but it still blows my mind how we think making memes or speaking out 'facts' is going to help. Facts aren't going to do a damn thing if tomorrow someone who the youth looks up to (either for entertainment or for any other reason) says on their platform that 'logic khatre me hai'. Kunal literally said in his stand up that ' abolishing triple talaq is only being celebrated because musl!m man's privilege is being cut by hindus'. We'll always be given the harsh end of the stick if we don't act fast and devise controls of attacking back, and the main reason why I hate this government is that it doesn't understand the value of building that narrative. CAA protests perfectly stated how international narrative can change everything, I used to discuss with my friends and as soon as I beat them with facts and figures the whole topic changed to 'but there's so much poverty and no hospitals ya, why is this being made an issue'. THIS is what they've done right, influence the gullible youth to a point they're absolutely brainwashed. Bollywood has been doing it for decades by showcasing Pak as the most loving country this world has ever had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the main reason why a Samay Raina whose family was directly influenced by islamists where he was kicked out (he even publically states in his stand up and follows some right wing twitter handles) supports Munawar and praises journalists like Rana Ayyub and Faye Dsouza on his streams. The main reason why you'll never hear any celebrities speak about the other side, because what the right needs to do is take control of the international narrative and it should be the main priority. No matter how many genocides you've done, how much hatred you have inside you for the other kin. As long as you are paying influencial folks abroad it's all going to be a winning game for you."<br />Author: 'for_acadamia'  id: 'spp31n'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/spp31n/are_we_losing_the_narrative_war_and_what_can_we/</li>

Learning to lose'<br />Body: '*“Let it be known, for centuries forth: that Magadha, after her conquest of Mathura, found herself conquered by her.”*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/21/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**—3.2. Learning to lose—**\n\n*In the 163th year of Magadha hegemony*\n\n*(329 BC)*\n\nOf all the kings gathered at Taxila for the conference on the behest of Professor Chanakya, King Purushottama was not only the tallest, at one hundred and twenty six two-third-inches in height – but also the mightiest, the most knowledgeable, and as he was known for, unmatched in his righteousness and his commitment to the protection of his kingdom and the Vedic ways. \n\nHis line of Vrishnis had fleed Mathura generations prior at orders from the Heir of Samkarshana to settle and cultivate tracts in the Western lands should the city fall to Magadha – such colonies had been established in the rugged Western Sindh, as a house of the Arjunayanas in Kurukshetra, and in the rival cousins who ruled between the Jhelum and Chenab rivers and the Chenab and Ravi rivers respectively – and Purushottama was the former of these kings.\n\nBut the Vrishnis were done fleeing. A follower of Chanakya – despite his own sons not having been judged as worthy of admission to Taxila – Purushottama had attended many a speech of the young Brahmin’s, and followed his advice in economic policy and military strategy. Wielding in battle the banner of Vasudeva Krishna, he had defeated the Kekayas of Girivraja and built a prosperous city out of Shuktimati, and he had single-handedly fended off Persian incursions.\n\nTo attend this conference, Purushottama had cast off all historical enmities with the traitorous, unrighteous Gandharas – the descendants of the wicked Shakuni – for despite all his apprehensions about them, Purushottama had placed his best faith in the wisdom of Professor Chanakya, the man who had caused the barbarian Persians to flee the civilized world.\n\nSo when the Professor suggested that he *not* fight this Alexander – to meekly submit to *this* barbarian and allow his country to be seized – Great King Purushottama was understandably furious.\n\n“Professor,” said Purushottama, forcing the respect back into his voice, “I allowed the Persians to take not even two thirds of an inch of my land. And you alone were able to cause the Persians to retreat. I must ask you what is so different about *the*se barbarians.”\n\n“It is true that defensive wars are much easier to fight than offensive ones, in general,” Chanakya admitted. “Yet my attack on the Persians was in an opportune moment – for us. Alexander’s attack will be in an opportune moment for *him*. Either one must wait for an opportune moment, or train to make a moment opportune – but we do not have the same information about Alexander’s army or strategy that he may have about us.”\n\nWhen his sons had insulted Chanakya’s birth and called him an upstart – for being of a distant Southern country of little repute, for not being of an ancient line as they were – King Purushottama had disciplined them with great severity, chastising them for insulting a most learned scholar, for the king had never been one to be jealous of ambitious Brahmins, however secretive their goals might be, instead seeking their counsel at every step. \n\nYet this apparent differential treatment of the Persians and the Greeks – both barbarians, both enemies attacking from the same routes and with the same goals – aroused Purushottama’s suspicions of these secret goals, and the king was also not one to suppress such suspicions and follow in line, eyes closed, with an advisor’s diktat.\n\n“An opportune moment?” Purushottama pressed. “Like Taxila, that bent for the Persians for one hundred and eighty-eight years before deciding to strike back? Must I also live another one hundred and eighty-eight years to see my kingdom freed again, under your counsel?”\n\nChanakya ignored the comment, as if offended that the king had not listened more closely to something. “You do realize,” he continued, “That your territory is in a precarious state, trapped between two enemies?”\n\nThere was a rumour, that King Purushottama had heard from his wife – that years prior, Chanakya had developed affections for a Greek studentess at Taxila, even admitting her to his gurukula without the necessary qualifications and having his lectures specially transcribed to her in writing – and that her words of affection for him, in the Greek language, were repeated to this day by a parrot on the premises of the university.\n\nPurushottama had chastised her for telling him about such irrelevant gossip. \n\n“One of these enemies is *your* king,” Purushottama shot back. “Is this what this meeting is, Professor? A veiled threat? Is that all that Taxila’s foreign policy is – to surrender to any barbarian who wishes to seize it?”\n\n“And the same is true of the entire region of Punjab and Sindh,” Chanakya continued, “Trapped between the Magadhas and the Persians, now the Greeks – and were these two powers to ally, we would be faced by war on both fronts, should we not seek the protection of one of these empires. Our disunity is only an impediment to co-ordination.”\n\nPurushottama froze.\n\nThe consideration the interests of the civilized world as a whole, rather than merely his kingdom; the thought of a unified empire to rule the Punjab and Sindh – these were daydreams that had often occupied Purushottama, daydreams that he had dismissed as being precisely such. It was *jarring* to hear Professor Chanakya – a man he revered, despite their current differences – speak of (or hint to) such ideas, even if not explicitly or coherently; it *touched* the king’s mind on some deep level. \n\nHe shook it off, recalling what one of his ministers had warned him about, based on his experience debating with Professor Chanakya: the Professor was incredibly persuasive, not necessarily because he was *true*, but because he would infer – from your intellect, personality, actions, conversations – your truest and most unspoken thoughts and desires, and make arguments that he knew you could not reject without feeling disappointment in yourself. \n\n“The same was true when faced against the Persians,” the king pointed out, “And yet you defeated them, and yet Magadha has not made any Westward incursions.”\n\nChanakya stayed silent.\n\n“So what if their army outnumbers ours?” Purushottama continued, “Let them outnumber us a huhndred-fold – so be it, each one of our soldiers will slay a hundred of theirs!”\n\n“And if each one of theirs slays ten of yours?” Chanakya questioned. “Everything you suggest – fighting on two fronts, fighting armies larger than one’s own – requires *strategy*. Especially when Alexander himself is no ordinary commander. He is *creative*.”\n\nThe Persians had fielded far larger forces against his one, and yet he had won, time and again, through superior strategy and a more courageous army. To hear the Professor speak in such high terms of the Greeks – like a traitor might, to demoralize a defender – incited fury in him, and he said so in as many words.\n\n“If you truly believed your own arguments,” Purushottama said bitterly, “You would be urging me to surrender, but rather offering me your advice in military strategy against the Greeks.”\n\n“And that is precisely what I am doing,” Chanakya responded evenly. “You can defeat the Greeks, with my advice – I believe this. The important condition in that sentence being – *with my advice*. A frontal immediate war, on the Greeks’ terms, is not my advice. You must learn to lose a battle to win a war; this is my advice. Send me a pigeon if you wish to hear any more of it.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*When a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful enemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the enemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water).*\n\n*Bharadvaja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong, bows down before Indra (the god of rain).*\n\n*But Visalaksha says that a weak king should rather fight with all his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles; fighting is the natural duty of a kshatriya, no matter whether he achieves victory or sustains defeat in battle.*\n\n*No, says Kauṭilya: he who bows down to all like a crab on the riverbank lives in despair; whoever goes with his small army to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the protection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an impregnable fort.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 12.1:1-9\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Oh great conqueror,” Roxana pleaded, “You are unmatched in your strategic acumen and your conquests, but do believe me when I say that I understand the pulse of my people.”\n\n“Why should I spare my enemies in victory? It would be foolish of me to even ask – *would they have done me the same favour, had I been defeated?* – for such a scenario would never have manifested in the first place.”\n\n“They are mercenaries, my lord – they are loyal to whoever pays them, and for a sufficient price they will swear not to consider any competing offer. To execute them would be akin to executing the craftsmen who made your enemies’ swords.”\n\n“Loyalty?” asked the young man. “Their leader deserted them as soon as my victory became obvious to him.”\n\n“Shashigupta is not of my country, my Lord. But he alone is capable of leading this corporation, and all its other members have all the noble qualities of us Iranians, whom you so admire.”\n\n“In truth, I do not know why I bother to entertain you in my quarters. This is not your place—”\n\n“Please, my lord, my word is true—”\n\n“—What are your motives for protecting them? What is your stake in this?”\n\nRoxana was nervous. It would not do at all to have her husband know that she was being blackmailed by her former lover, and that that was whom she was pleading him to spare.\n\n“I am a princess of Bactria, and do not wish that harm be done to my people. But I am also your wife, and thus I would never lie to you. Thus, I have made no attempt to protect those members of my family who I believed may conspire against you – I even used my connections with them to extort that information for you, so you could be certain. I care not for Shashigupta himself, only his followers – when I tell you to spare him, it is out of my concern for you, that I believe he will serve you well.”\n\nIn truth, Alexander was not sure why he had been considering a mass-execution at all – it was as if it had been dropped in drunken conversation and he had taken it as fact. It had always been his practice to execute only the leaders of his enemies, rather than massacre every peasant who had taken arms against him.\n\n“Shashigupta has offered to show me the hidden treasures of Bactria, if I promise to spare him,” the Greek king said at last. “Those which the members of your family took poison to avoid divulging. If he does follow through on this, that shall demonstrate both his competence, in uncovering such secrets, and his future loyalty to me, for he will not have taken these treasures for himself. If he does not, then I will execute him. That is my word.”'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'spa7lv'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/spa7lv/the_great_empire_ch_3_yavana_kanda_32_learning_to/</li>

I hope this sub loves and is proud of our desi cats and dogs. I am writing this post on behalf of Tails N Trees and we have started a low-cost cat sterilization program.   \n\n\n**What is sterilization?**  \n\nSterilization is a surgical procedure done on both male and female cats that prevents them from having babies. \n\n\n**Why should you care?** \n\nIf you are not compassionate towards cats, you see less of cats. \nIf you are compassionate towards cats, the burden to rescue, adopt, feed is reduced. Some may be aware dogs attack cats and how terrible the aftermath is, this can also be avoided.   \n\n**How does sterilization help cats?**\n\nThey don't have kittens. They are prone to fight less. The chances of them getting diseases that may be caused due to mating, risk of testicular / ovary cancer is reduced. Feel free to research this topic.\n\n**Do cats become lazy after sterilization?**\n\nNo, they are active and calm as usual and prefer to stay within their territory. \n\n\n**Why don't people sterilize their cats then?**\n\nIt needs some effort.\n\nPeople may think it is unnatural or against their beliefs or wish.\n\nThey are scared of what would happen to the cat after surgery.\n\nIt is very costly, not everybody can afford it.\n\nFeel free to add your point on why would you consider not to sterilize a cat.     \n\n**Sterilization is safe and done by a professional vet.**\n \n \n**What are we trying to solve?** \n\nRight now almost any vet or organization in Pune charges anywhere from Rs 3500 - Rs 12000, on average a good vet charges Rs 6000. Unlike for dogs, there is no animal birth control program for cats provided by the government. \nSo if a person does wish to sterilize a cat due to the cost they may avoid it. This is where Tails N Trees would like to help such people. \n\nWe have started initiatives that can help such individuals. To book a slot feel free to dm me or dm @tailsntrees on Instagram.\n\n\n\n**What about post-op (post-operative care)?**\n\nIt takes up to 3 days for males to recover usually males need to be kept under observation.\nIt takes around 2 weeks for females as the incision is done to remove the ovaries. You can use a collar or wrap them in cloth so that cats don't bite their scars. We suggest that you could do the post of yourself as the cat may be comfortable with you. A vet will guide you in detail about the post-op after the surgery is done. \nIn case you cant do a post-op we can suggest some fosters that can take care of your cat during post-op. \n   \n\nNote: \n\n1. Surgeries do come at your risk, we have tied up with highly skilled professional vets with years of experience. \n1. The above costs do not cover vaccinations.\n1. Right now we have tied up with limited vets. If you know of a highly-skilled vet who would also believe in our mission feel free to refer them to us."<br />Author: 'xpsdeset'  id: 'sp05sg'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sp05sg/we_have_started_a_lowcost_cats_sterilization/</li>

Is that the path we want to take to be progressive? I don\'t want to sit here and pretend that different laws for different religions do not exist in this country. The mear fact that child marriage and dowry is still legal under the Muslim marriage act is something we do not talk enough about. \n\nI am not against wearing hijab, but if an institution demands you not to practice your religion under it, you don\'t practice. That is what true secularism is. Feminists were crying a few months ago about how hijab is patriarchal in nature and should be banned and I am glad that many still stand with this statement. When the hijab was brought into question under courts, for some it is suddenly not about the patriarchy but about right to religion? And it is still asking what women should or shouldn\'t wear? Are you dumb?\n\n\nNo Hindu boy after his janeu ceremony is letting his hair grow or do sandyawandana 5 times a day in school because that is not allowed. No Hindu is crying that his/her right to practice religion is under threat there.

Now the right to self expression also expands into protecting the right of the person who wants to wear it! In the Indian context the "pagdi" of the sikh boy, many hindus wear pagdi of different kinds, many sacred threads, lockets and whatnot if we ban burkha should we ban every thing religious? The right way is to standardise like the army does it, incorporating how a pagdi should be worn.... Etc. Similarly "hijab" (not burkha) should be standardised in the uniform. Eliminating the need of burkha.\n\nShould burkha be banned? In my view its the biggest "kalank" on the muslim society and if it were to me i would erase it. The muslim society needs big reforms and the word reforms have been thrown out of dictionary from the muslim mind. This is the harsh reality. And the maulanas are behind it. The muslim ladies too dont realise how they are being used against themselves.\n\nShould regressive coverings be banned? Yes. Is hijab regressive? To me it is. but we have to pragmatic about it. Implementation should be in a way that the person who wants to follow the path of their choice has a few options too. Just like sikhs where uniforms are adapted and a standardised instruction is laid out.\n\nAny person who supports the rights of women, freedom, feminism and here fights behind the banner of supporting these brainwashed students fighting to wear their hideous, regressive burkha in any circumstance it may be, is a hypocrite!'<br />Author: 'HoldenCaulfield98'  id: 'sopqu9'<br />Score:151<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sopqu9/karnataka_burkha_row_my_views_as_an_exmuslim_a/</li>

A school disallows hijab? So what? Did it have to be politicized? When the hindu students started wearing saffron as their religious identity, the ban was enforced even further so. Because there's simply no way to provide provision for just hijab, which is a choice and a religious identity, without allowing the other kids to wear saffron as well.\n\nThey think the fake blow up out of proportion would make my hate my hindu roots - wrong. It makes me staunchly embrace them. I cannot stand this anymore. If someone asked me a month ago, whether hijabs should be allowed in school, like many others, I would have said yes. Today, I say no.

      <li>Title::: 'Saree Ghonghat Hijab is different from Burka. Do people even know that one is used to cover Body &amp; other is used to cover the clothes on your body'<br />Body: "Saree Ghonghat Hijab is different from Burka. I think that's why people got no problem with Hijab &amp; the main focus is on Burka in educational institutions.\nAnd also people are saying Saraswati Mantra in school should be stopped! Why? The mantra has been part of Indian culture from the beginning, why the country should leave their culture?"<br />Author: 'P4Panda2'  id: 'sofee8'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/sofee8/saree_ghonghat_hijab_is_different_from_burka_do/</li>
