      <li>Title::: "You'll at home for next 3 weeks. Know how to make the best out of this time."<br />Body: "Our honourable prime minister Mr. Modi recently announced a 21-days lockdown in order to prevent covid-19 from spreading. Let's fight this virus together by staying at home and making the best out of our quality time. I've got some ideas to utilize the time while being at home. I hope they'll help you too.\n\nIndoor workout: Plan your diet and take care of your body. It's much easier to do it now that there is no outside food to distract you anymore. Go to your room, turn on the songs and start dancing. Watch YouTube videos and learn some cool steps to flaunt later. You can also download an android or ios app for home workout to keep yourself in shape.\n\nFamily time: Right. I said it. We've spent enough time with colleagues and friends. It's time to know them who knows you better than anyone else out there. Show some respect towards your parents and thank them for being by your side in such hard times.\n\nTake an online course: Brush up your skills or follow your passion. Download a free course from udemy, HubSpot or any other online teaching firm and practice something you like or something that would help you with your career in future.\n\nDIY (Do it yourself): The more time you spend at home, the more you’ll realise how much work there is to be done! With all the spare time on your hands, there’s no better time to start filtering through all those odd jobs that you just never got around to. Whether it’s time to re-paint the skirting boards or to drill a hole in the wall and finally hang the mirror up, see what other DIY tasks you can find whilst you’re self-isolating.\n\nCook: Since you won't be able to order your favourite food, it's time to learn how to cook it all by yourself. Go on and try as much recipes as possible. YouTube is all yours to explore!\n\nMovie/Series marathon: We’ve all got atleast 2 such friends who are dying to suggest us their favourite movies and series no matter which genre we prefer, they've always got some good suggestions for us. Now is the right time to text them.\n\nMedidate: Last and most important thing. With everyone going crazy out there and panicking, it's really important to keep your mind refreshed. The best thing to do that is by meditating. You can find lots of easy ways to meditate online on YouTube or you can simply close your eyes and start concentrating on your breath. Isolate yourself from everyone for few minutes, turn on a relaxing music and just loose yourself with the flow of beats.\n\nThanks for being a responsible citizen and all the best for your fight against Covid-19. Take care! 🙂"<br />Author: 'the_logical_bot'  id: 'foaonz'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/foaonz/youll_at_home_for_next_3_weeks_know_how_to_make/</li>

Coronavirus is most often transmitted through coughing and close contact between people. \n\nFor Re-Use, the goal is to prolong the use of each mask instead of re-use.\n\nIn general, maintaining safety precautions like physical distancing - 1m distance minimum, surrounding cleanliness, air filtration, hand hygiene, masks will help in a long way in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo widely used masks are explained below:\n\n*Other masks such as P100, full face respirator etc are excluded from this list\\**\n\n|MASK|USE|DESCRIPTION|WHO NEEDS FOR COVID-19|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Surgical mask(disposable) - [Image](https://media-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com/business-insider-editorial/images/2020/03/10/d002f1c96d9b78d30ce5c641cf4663d9/surgical-mask.png?imageOpt=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=102)| Surgeons (mainly, so they don\'t get germs on their patients) | Can help protect wearers from getting others sick through their spit.Doesn\'t protect healthy people from acquiring an illness, and a loose fit leaves room for error | Sick people (to avoid infecting others), and caretakers |\n| N95 respirator(disposable)  - [Image](https://media-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com/business-insider-editorial/images/2020/03/10/429e89219c3cc8cc09b3916e59358bba/n95.png?imageOpt=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;width=100)| Working with dust, mold, or medical/environmental emergencies.

Source - [US FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks#s2).  \n\nA face mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.  *Surgical masks are not intended to be used more than once.* \n\nThe "N" in an **N95 respirator** stands for "not resistant to oil" and the 95 means that during "worst case" testing, the filter was able to capture 95% of the most penetrating particles in the air (down to 0.3 microns). A respirator still has a chance of incorrect use. \n\nHere is CDC guidelines on the correct usage of a respirator. - [Link](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2018/01/04/respirators-public-use/)\n\nComparison between both by US-FDA- [Link](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks)\n\n**Please note:** N-95 respirators are extremely low supply and important for health care workers to have, not only for their protection but for the affected patients, and the entire chain of care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HOW AND WHEN TO RE-USE MASKS\\***\n\nSince, we are facing a shortage of masks across the world. Here are some guidelines on re-use of masks released by various international organisations. Note: Re-use guidelines apply only to those who are fit-tested for a disposable N95 respirator. (since supply is low)\n\nMASKS:\n\n*  Perform hand hygiene\n* Remove the procedure mask by holding the ear loops. The front is probably contaminated, so remove slowly and carefully. \n* After removing facemask, visually inspect for contamination, distortion in shape/form. If contaminated or wet the mask should be discarded. \n* If the facemask is NOT visibly contaminated or distorted, carefully store in the paper bag to avoid destroying the shape of the mask. \n* The facemask should be stored in a dedicated, well-ventilated container (i.e., paper bag with handles) with user name &amp; date.\n*  A disposable facemask can be worn for several hours if not wet or distorted, and not touched while delivering patient care. \n\nN-95:\n\n Once the disposable N95 respirator is donned and the seal check should be performed.\n\n1. Seal check:  No air should be felt around the perimeter while blowing out. If you feel air coming out it is not a tight seal. \n2. When taking a small breath in, the mask should pucker in slightly. If it does not, it is not reusable. \n3. When breathing out you should feel the respirator expand slightly. If it does not, it is not reusable.\n4. If not a tight seal, the respirator cannot be re-used \n5. Ensure the mask is breathable, if unable to breathe in the mask, the respirator cannot be reused. \n\n* Up to five re-uses if the manufacturer does not provide a recommendation\n* Check the recommended inspection procedures, if there is damage, wetness, color change, etc\n* Clean hands with soap, alcohol before/after touching the Mask.\n* Discard any respirator that is obviously damaged or becomes hard to breathe through.\n* Pack or store respirators between uses so that they do not become damaged or deformed.\n* Perform hand hygiene at ALL TIMES.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general for all masks:\n\n* DO NOT SHARE the masks or respirators! \n* Follow the manufacturer’s user instructions, including conducting a user seal check.\n* Dispose when used.\n* Maintain hand hygiene, and physical distancing at ALL TIMES.\n\nSource: Excellent CDC guidelines on re-use of masks - [LINK](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html)\n\nSource: Nebraska Med COVID-19 PPE Guidance - [LINK](https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/COVID-Extended-Use-Reuse-of-PPE-and-N95.pdf?date=03182020)'<br />Author: 'xsupermoo'  id: 'fo8wet'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fo8wet/rational_use_of_masks_during_covid19_situation/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Estimation of number of Coronavirus cases in India'<br />Body: "While India don't have the capacity to test many asymptomatic patients given our massive population, we can extrapolate from the reliable data available from other top performing countries under the assumption that the deaths from Coronavirus get reported widely more than the actual cases.\n\n \nSouth Korea which is often considered  as the benchmark for mass Coronavirus testing, including asymptomatic patients, has 120 deaths and 9037 patients according to Worldometers as of now. This gives us a rough estimate that 1.327  percent die for every 100 people affected.\n\n Using the Korea's ratio of 1.327 deaths for every 100 Covid cases, we can extrapolate India's Coronavirus cases. Given India's  10 deaths,  we get approximately 753  people that can be affected by Coronavirus, which means we are  underreporting the total cases as only 519 cases have been confirmed till now.   \n\nOne thing to notice is that, the deaths from covid could be after two weeks from the date of  infection, which implies that the number of Coronavirus cases that we calculated as 753 might be an estimate from 2 weeks ago. \n\n Thus we need to consider how the Coronavirus spreads among the populace given a timeline. Covid-19 is  reportedly has a reproduction rate (R0) of between 2 and 3, meaning every person who is infected can potentially infect 2 to 3 person on average.  As it is  complicated to estimate how quickly it spreads to others, we can assume that Covid cases may double in numbers every 3 to 7 days. Assuming it doubles in number every two days, we can have now have Coronavirus cases between 3012 (assuming Covid  doubles every 7 days 753*2^2) and 19125 (assuming period of 3 days 753*2^4.667 ).  Assuming 5 day doubling time, we may have around 5244 people affected with Covid-19 now."<br />Author: 'Conscious-Elk'  id: 'fo74u9'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fo74u9/estimation_of_number_of_coronavirus_cases_in_india/</li>

The sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nArjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the kṣatriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of Śrī Kṛṣṇa (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships.\n\n**Question 1 : What qualities of Arjuna made him a fit candidate for liberation ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hoy8eohg2jo41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb821665c7d529573fcf65afebd31be6e2f344e\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fnwspk'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fnwspk/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_26/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Bridging the gap between the right and the left.'<br />Body: 'The present political climate in India is extremely polarized and vitiating. The right and the left hate each other and blame games are the only response to any problem.  \nI was wondering if this always has to be the case.\n\nIt makes the common man\'s life difficult if one group is called "sanghi" and the other is "commie". There are good and bad aspects of the ideologies of both groups. Centrists are absent from the scene but are needed for India\'s progress. \n\nWhat can be done to bridge the perspective gap between the right and the left? \n\nWhile there will be a few bigots on both sides, not everyone who supports the BJP is a fan of drinking cow urine. They have concerns related to religion and the economy which they feel the BJP is better able to resolve. At the same time, not everyone from the left is an idealistic idiot living in the world of dreams and doing minority appeasement. Many aspects of the left ideology are important in India- the social safety nets for poor people, good healthcare and education for everyone etc. The problem is that the left chooses to ignore the inconsistency of its own leadership- Prakash Karat who leads the CPIM is a disaster and has ruined the party, but no one opposes him. They now have Kanhaiya Kumar who has 0 contributions to any social cause and only gives speeches hating the current PM. \n\nI think that there has to be a middle ground. State ownership of corporations may not be a suitable model for India anymore because most directors will be appointed from the IAS and other cadre services, who may not be able to run specialized enterprises effectively. At the same time, a total capitalistic economy without any safety nets is not viable because India needs massive investments in upgrading human capital, something which corporations and markets alone are not interested in pursuing unless there\'s a profit to be made. \n\nI wish people who take an interest in politics and its effect on the economy get around their biases and have open dialogues with each other about issues and solutions, instead of wasting their lives making personal attacks. I stopped watching TV debates because most often you see nothing but shouting and useless remarks about minority appeasement (by the left) or religious fanaticism (by the right).\n\nI did not intend to hurt anyone\'s sentiments through this post. I genuinely wish India has a united leadership and citizenry to resolve its legacy issues and tide over the economic storm that is coming.   \n\n\nTLDR: Both rightist and leftist methods are needed in India. Open markets and competition to drive the economy and massive improvement in healthcare and education to upskill the population.'<br />Author: 'The_Real_Deshbhakt'  id: 'fnwqkf'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fnwqkf/bridging_the_gap_between_the_right_and_the_left/</li>

It has not only earned praise by WHO and US administration but more critically so far it also ensured that despite its 1.3 billion population there are less than 400 cases and less than 10 deaths in India.\n\nBut government can't do anything if people continue to behave like selfish, entitled, egotist and ideology driven idiots. In Italy, out of 12500 cases with an outcome the MORTALITY RATE IS 48 %. Corona Virus is THAT dangerous.\n\nTherefore pleases follow instructions of administrative and health staff. Do not be a rebel for sake of it. Stand firmly with your government, community and family to fight off this menace. We are all together in this Ship.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://thediplomat.com/…/india-evacuates-citizens-others-…/](https://thediplomat.com/…/india-evacuates-citizens-others-…/)\n\n[https://www.firstpost.com/…/over-450-indian-evacuated-from-…](https://www.firstpost.com/…/over-450-indian-evacuated-from-…)\n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/…/article…/74634306.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/…/article…/74634306.cms)\n\n[https://www.financialexpress.com/…/saviour-air-ind…/1905308/](https://www.financialexpress.com/…/saviour-air-ind…/1905308/)\n\n[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/…/coronavirus-india-quarantine…](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/…/coronavirus-india-quarantine…)\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/india-quarantine-stamp-fleeing-iso…](https://www.newsweek.com/india-quarantine-stamp-fleeing-iso…)\n\n[https://www.livemint.com/…/coronavirus-impact-centre-suspen…](https://www.livemint.com/…/coronavirus-impact-centre-suspen…)"<br />Author: 'TakeItEasyPolicy'  id: 'fng4vy'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fng4vy/indias_fight_against_coronavirus/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Economic growth under Modi government'<br />Body: "#DISCLAIMER- THIS IS NOT A POST BY ME. I AM MERELY SHARING THE POST BY COPY PASTING IT HERE. \n#SOURCE OF THIS ENTIRE ARTICLE [Quora Article by SAKET KUMAR](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-convince-me-that-India-is-growing-economically-under-Modi-with-a-picture/answer/Saket-Kumar-877?ch=10&amp;share=a6f49746&amp;srid=uObHfb)\n# Original Article has all pictures and graphs for you to refer to. This post only has the text\n\n\nI am trained as a Scientist so first I have to present credible relevant data before I can convince anyone. First I will answer the question with 1 picture and explain 3 parameters.\n\nThe below image is not fake. They are NASA satellite images of India taken during night time.\n\n￼\n\nAs you can see one on the left is from 2012 and on the right is from 2016. The research paper written by Luis R. Martinez from University of Chicago shows that increased use of electricity at night is parallel to country’s economic growth. Further he states in that paper authoritarian countries like China and Russia are fudging their GDP anywhere from 15 to 30% every year. You can read the research paper here How Much Should We Trust the Dictator's GDP Growth Estimates? or you can read Washington Post article .\n\nNow the 3 Parameters\n\nModi became PM on May 26th 2014. In October 2014 IMF came out with a report which said India set to become $2 trillion economy in 2014: IMF . India’s GDP was ~$1.9 Trillion when Modi became PM. Fast forward now the same IMF says India’s GDP is $3.2 Trillion . Here is the snap shot directly from IMF website.\n\n￼\n\n**Note: IMF always slightly understates GDP to account for any observational bias and inaccuracies. This is GDP estimate from a totally neutral source so you can’t say this is BJP propaganda or call it as fake.\n\n→Conclusion from GDP data: Modi government added $1.2 Trillion to GDP in 5 years. India reached $1 Trillion GDP in 2007 India had joined trillion-dollar club in 2007 so even after 7 years of being in power UPA couldn’t even make India $2 Trillion economy. When Atalji left office in 2004 India had $700 billion GDP according to World bank report . So UPA in 10 years added $1.2 Trillion in GDP but Modiji did the same in 5 years.\n\nInflation: Inflation in Economic terms is general increase in prices and fall in purchasing power parity. As you know when there is increase in inflation prices rise on many goods and services and your purchasing power decreases. Just because prices increased on goods and services doesn’t mean your boss is going to increase your salary unless you are a Central government employee where you get Dearness allowance - Wikipedia to compensate for high inflation. Let’s look at inflation from 1998 :\n\n￼\n\nInflation directly affects the common man. When Atalji came to power in 1998 inflation was through the roof at 13.5%. He cracked down on inflation and brought it down to ~4% and maintained the same through out his Premiership. This is a PM who cared for the common man. Now look at the graph after 2004. UPA always maintained high inflation which on average was above 8%+ which emptied people’s pockets faster than they could spend. Just see how the graph dips when Modi became PM in 2014. Keeping inflation down is one of the paramount tasks of any BJP Prime Minister.\n\nImportant Note: GDP growth in some ways is tied to inflation. If you have a GDP growth rate of 10% with 10% inflation then it’s no use. It’s better to have GDP growth of 5% with low inflation rate of below 2%. Lower the inflation the better for the economy as long as it is not in negative. UPA always boasts about high GDP but never ever mention inflation rate during their term because they know they will be caught with pants down. Some people can see through the BS of UPA’s high GDP growth. GDP surged under UPA because it purchased growth at a high price .\n\n→Conclusion from Inflation data: Inflation was always low under Atalji and Modiji. No Economist can deny that. No amount of propaganda from Congress can deny this brutal truth. In between all the lies even the scammer, fraud and corrupt Chiddu accepts it High inflation was a big red in the UPA-2 report card: P Chidambaram .\n\nForex Reserves: When Atalji became PM in 1998 India’s forex reserves was ~$30 billion . When he left office in 2004 it had jumped to $114 billion . When Modi became PM on May 26th 2014 the forex reserves was $303 billion . Now as of March 13th 2020 forex reserves is Forex reserves surge by $5.69 billion to reach record $487.23 bn .\n\n***Note: It is exactly because of our lower forex reserves we had to approach IMF in 1991. In return for IMF bail out India had to open up it’s markets for outside investment. If India doesn’t have enough forex then Economy comes to a standstill as India will lack the capability to pay for external goods and services which it imports. We import 90% of our Oil from abroad. If there is no oil then there is no economy.\n\n→Conclusion from Forex data: Atalji as PM increased forex from $30 billion to $114 billion in 6 years during Pokran sanctions and unfavorable economic climate. Atalji’s government added $114B - $30B = $84 billion into forex. At the end of UPA tenure forex was $303 billion. So UPA in 10 years added $303B - $114B = $189 billion. Now how much did Modi Sarkar added in 5 years? $487B - $303B = $184 billion. As you can see just like GDP what UPA did in 10 years Modiji government has done the same for forex in 5 years. And we still have 4 more years to go. I hope India reaches $1 Trillion in forex which can help India project power. None of the countries who are barking on CAA will bark again when you have a war chest of Trillion dollars.\n\nFinal Conclusion: I have only added 3 parameters to my answer since the question is asking everything to be in 1 picture which is not possible. But anyone can tell you simple truth if Modiji hasn’t done anything since he became PM then all the above parameters would be worse off than how UPA left them in 2014. Those 3 are very very important parameters for India. If India is performing worse like some morons who are predicting apocalypse for Indian economy are saying then the data is not backing them up."<br />Author: 'DeadBodiesinMyArse'  id: 'fnf96v'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fnf96v/economic_growth_under_modi_government/</li>

I'm basically from Odisha and I live in Hyderabad - a place that I found largely anti to the current government due to its significant Muslim population. Exactly at the said time yesterday, all of my misunderstandings and notions vanished into thin air; oh wow, what a response to the PM's call for thanks and solidarity to the essential services. I have no doubts as to my home Odisha's nationalistic leanings; we're fiercely patriotic and the PM has a large support there, but about Hyderabad I had my doubts. Surprisingly, here I had the pleasure of witnessing something similar to what I'd see at home. I started receiving calls from home with reports that people came out on to the streets with plates, glasses, ghantis, shankhs and whatnot, and it continued banging for a whole 20 mins, and I told them back that it was exactly the same situation here. Everybody was electrified and unified with a spirit of oneness. Till now I thought that only Cricket and War could unite us; now I've found that a pandemic threat can unite us, too. I was told that Muslims didn't participate, and that was the case here in the Society I live.\n\nBhubaneswar was mostly deserted yesterday, similar with Hyderabad, too, except for a few mischievous and irresponsible fun-seekers. Most people are behaving very responsibly, which is a great sign, all over the country. This sub is doing a stupendous job about keeping everyone updated; shout-out to Orwell and team. \n\nI had my doubts that the country was going the pseudo-liberal way, but I'm happy to see that the real world is wayyyyy different from the internet world; people are rational and reasonable. As regards Covid-19, it can be a long fight, and I believe we might witness further curfews in the days to come; be prepared mentally.

Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Kṛṣṇa. If the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a kṣatriya in name only, and if the son of a brāhmaṇa acts impiously, he is a brāhmaṇa in name only. Such kṣatriyas and brāhmaṇas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Kṛṣṇa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a kṣatriya. Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore Kṛṣṇa said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.3, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](lbs7y7srd7o41)\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose still a war criminal.'<br />Body: ' \n\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s name is still a part of the Indian war criminals’ list in the United Nations, and no Indian government has made any efforts to get his name removed, says the freedom fighter’s great-grand-niece, Rajyashree Chaudhuri. The British had included Netaji’s name in the United Nations’ list of Indian war criminals because he fought against them during World War II. Even Jawaharlal Nehru described Netaji as a “war criminal” while corresponding with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee after Bose’s disappearance in 1945. According to Chaudhuri, India did not ask the UN to remove the name when the world body ratified the war criminals’ list in 1971.\n\nWhen a Bangalore-based RTI activist, Choodamani Nagendra, asked the Central government this year about the efforts if any, it was making to remove Netaji’s name from the list of war criminals, she was told that no information on the matter was available. Choodamani had also asked for a number of UN records relating to Netaji’s war criminal status that was with the government. Has the Indian representative in the UN taken up the matter of removing Netaji’s name from the list, she had asked.\n\nRajyashree Chaudhuri has now written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to get the “war criminal” tag removed, before starting the process of declassification of files on 23 January 2016. She has received an acknowledgment from the Prime Minister’s Office on the matter.\n\n \n\n“Does it make any sense to open the secret files of a ‘bad person’ who is a ‘war criminal’?” asked Chaudhury, who has started a signature campaign under the banner of Jatiya Jagran Mancha, asking the Centre to ensure the immediate removal of the tag by the United Nations.\n\nChaudhuri and a group of experts, professionals and social thinkers organized a signature campaign and protest meeting at Hazra More in Kolkata on 14 November on the matter.\n\n“Though he was declared a ‘war criminal’ by the British, no effort was made by successive Indian governments to get this tag removed. This was done deliberately to ensure that Netaji did not appear before his countrymen. The government should honour him by getting this tag removed before files related to him are declassified,” said Chaudhury.\n\nThe war criminal tag was given by the British for Netaji’s association with the Germans and the Japanese during World War II. Significantly, Jawaharlal Nehru too used this tag to describe Netaji on 26 December 1945, after Netaji disappeared after the so-called plane crash on 18 August 1945.\n\n \n\nIn a deposition before the 1970 Khosla Commission to probe Netaji’s disappearance, Shyamalal Jain, the confidential steno of INA Defence Committee, had said, “Jawaharlal Nehru gave four papers from his writing pad to make four copies of a letter, which he would dictate to me on the typewriter, which I also complied… The contents of the letter, as far as I could remember, were as follows.\n\n*“Clement Attlee*\n\n*“Prime Minister of Britain*\n\n*“10, Downing Street, London*\n\n*“Dated: 26 December 1945*\n\n*“Dear Mr. Attlee,*\n\n*“I understand from the most reliable source that Stalin has allowed Subhas Chandra Bose, your war criminal, to enter Russian territory. This is clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians as Russia has been an ally of the British-Americans, which she should not have done. Please take care of it and do what you consider proper and fit.*\n\n*“Yours Sincerely*\n\n \n\n*“Jawaharlal Nehru”*\n\nChaudhury feels that the situation has now changed and it should not be difficult for the Indian government to get the tag deleted by the UN. “The government should write to the UN Secretary-General in this regard. Nations have progressed since our Independence and they should not hesitate in supporting our endeavour,” Chaudhury added.\n\nHistorians and experts have reacted sharply to the matter. Defence and security expert Wing Commander (Retired) Praful Bakshi demanded that an independent committee be set up to find out the “status” of Netaji in the eyes of the government. “The committee should find out whether Netaji continued to remain a ‘war criminal’ even after Independence. If yes, it should be found out what crimes he committed for which he was given the tag of ‘war criminal’. The committee should find out his present status,” he said.\n\n \n\nHowever, Prof Kapil Kumar, a noted historian, said that there was no need to remove the tag as it was not given by “our government”. “People like Bhagat Singh or Sukhdeo were ‘terrorists’ for the British government but ‘freedom fighters’ for us. Similarly, Netaji might have been a ‘war criminal’ for the British government, he was a ‘national hero’ for us,” said Kumar, who is also the director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Freedom Struggle Studies and chairperson of Faculty of History, School of Social Sciences, IGNOU.\n\nFor details see\n\n[70 years on, Netaji still a war criminal in UN records - The Sunday Guardian Live](https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/2313-70-years-netaji-still-war-criminal-un-records)'<br />Author: 'MostLiight'  id: 'fmjmgz'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fmjmgz/netaji_subhas_chandra_bose_still_a_war_criminal/</li>

I live in Houston, TX and my parents are so horrifically racist and I just need to get all this out because it literally feels a plague of the nastiest thoughts to hear them talk.\n\nMy parents, over the past few months and weeks, have become genuinely the most racist and xenophobic people I have ever seen. It has gotten exponentially, severely worse over the years and as I think about it more, I personally attribute this growing racism to the presidency of Modi. My parents are obsessed (honestly, even obsession is an understatement) with Modi, Amit Shah and their entire administration. Their main sources of news are Times Now, WhatsApp, and crazy YouTube debates.\n\nWhen it comes to muslims and Pakistanis, my parents have said the most hideous and horrifying things- things that I can’t even type out because they feel dirty to say. They have essentially stated that genocide of muslims is the only way to deal with muslims, they hear muslim last names and visibly scoff, they have stated that “people should litter the neighborhoods and homes of muslims so that they die surrounded by shit and filth”.\n\nIn regards to the Chinese, they say the typical Indian racist things like “these disgusting people eat everything, they eat these filthy and diseased animals, they all deserve to die. If they all don’t die through coronavirus, there should be a genocide”. Also, they will say these things about all East Asians bc they don’t even care enough to distinguish any of them, they’re all just Chinese to my parents. I could go on. I mean they pretty much have something nasty and horrific to say about every ethnicity except a few very specific subsets which are (wealthy, hindu, pro-BJP, pro-CAA Indians) and (Christian American whites).\n\nMy parents see themselves as the same as wealthy American whites and feel immense pride when seeing Trump. Even when he says the stupidest, most un-presidential things, my parents will exclaim “ah ! he has such a charming sense of humor” and they fell in love with him even more when they attended Howdy Modi. Also, my parents would tattoo “right-wing capitalism" on their fucking foreheads if they could. At this point, I have to pretty much always isolate myself in a room and wear headphones so I don’t hear the bullshit they spew out of their mouth and so that I don’t let it affect me. I NEVER want to be like them, or think like them.\n\nI never mention my political views (for context: I can’t vote due to age, but if I could, I’d vote for Bernie. I strongly support his views and the humanitarian nature of his campaign) to them because every time I do, they simply laugh and say “oh she’s a child, she knows nothing, but haha look at her trying to understand the world haha she doesn’t know anything”.\n\nAlso, they hate Kerala and everything that it stands for, when it is clearly probably the only state in India to maintain at least a semblance of humanity, order, literacy, tolerance, and lawfulness.\n\nAnyways, I apologize for how long this is but I just needed to get it out somewhere because I cant bear to hear them say things like this and Im just glad im going to college in august so I don’t have to hear this bullshit everyday.

She is moderately educated (10th pass , I think) and a homemaker and she doesn\'t really call me often. Maybe once every 2-3 months, so I was kind of surprised.  She gave me all instructions which any authentic Govt release will give. Asking me to not go out at any cost. Wash hands and keep clean. Although she didn\'t quite get the concept of work from home, she was adamant that I take leave from work for the next week and not go out at any cost.  She said these exact words "if we don\'t control this now, it will go out of hand like China"  She told how they have totally avoided going out. Only my uncle goes out for the work or groceries and they make him change his clothes and wash his hands and feet outside of the house itself before letting him come in. They have cancelled the mundan ceremony of my little cousin because of this. I asked her how is awareness levels in the village and asked her to explain to the villagers. She says nowadays village people also know everything. They had watched Modi\'s address on TV. I really felt happy  after this and felt positive. In the end, I told her to not fear a lot but be fully cautious and take all precautions. \n\nIf these people can understand, so why can\'t this big city dwellers, we just need to proactively educate and explain them.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.2'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam explains the conception of the Absolute Truth ? What simile has been given to describe the same ?**  \n**.**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:  \n.  \nvadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam  \nbrahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.  \n.  \n"The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān." (Bhāg. 1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\'s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun\'s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramātmā feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavān feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter."\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : Why Arjuna\'s conduct was not befitting that of a kṣatriya ? What is the main subject matter of this chapter ?**  \n**.**  \n**Answer 2 :** "The Sanskrit word Bhagavān is explained by the great authority, Parāśara Muni, the father of Vyāsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavān. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Kṛṣṇa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahmā, Lord Śiva, or Nārāyaṇa, can possess opulences as fully as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saṁhitā by Lord Brahmā himself that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavān, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.  \n.  \nīśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ  \nanādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam  \n.  \n"There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavān, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes." (Brahma-saṁhitā 5.1)  \n.  \nIn the Bhāgavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:  \n.  \nete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam  \nindrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge  \n.  \n"All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself." (Bhag. 1.3.28)  \n.  \nTherefore, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman."\n\n.  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.2, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n![img](gwtzis2q70o41)\n\n.  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress—the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a śūdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a kṣatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gītā was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

This is not true in case of planes while it is true incase of AC buses, trains and offices.\n\nThis is because in normal air conditing, the same air inside is re-circulated countless times and this is how ACs are able to keep the temperature low. But, incase of airplanes, the air is taken from outside the plane through the engines and then injected it inside the cabin as outside air is extremely cold in high altitudes.\n\nThere is very less re-circulation within the plane. Apart from this, the ACs in planes have very good filteration systems capable of filtering out viruses and bacteria.

      <li>Title::: 'Interesting perspective on International role of leftism in World-War 1 &amp; current implications. This was quoted by someone while discussing how left hate capital punishment, but love &amp; endorse political killings.'<br />Body: "  \n1) It is important to realise the depths of internationalism of the Left. The Left was made to be internationalist, had explicitly rejected national boundaries, passions and thoughts in favour of an internationalist underpinning right from its inception. It is a feature of Left. \n2) Two points lay in favour of Leftist internationalism. From the earliest days, Left was conceived as an anti-war [war between nations] concept. The Left did not disdain war in its entirety. It just rejected the national concepts, favouring instead a worldwide class struggle. \n3) However, the end result was that the Left attracted a large number of peaceniks, who genuinely abhorred war between nations and deplored the waste of it. These were the useful idiots of the Left. For the Left, war was not bad; only targets chosen in war between nations bad. \n4) While the peaceniks in the Left marched during WW1 [with candles!] abhorring the uselessness of war, the real Left did not deplore the war. People like Lenin, Munzenberg, etc, were actually delighted with the war starting, and they were utilising it for Leftist benefit. \n5) `Let the nations put guns into the hands of the proletariat, the bullets are for the generals' - was the refrain of the real Left. That millions of the proletariat would be killed in fighting their own generals did not bother them at all. They accepted it as necessary. \n6) While the peaceniks were pushing for dodging draft, and objecting to WW1 on ethical/principled bases, the Left's only concern was how to get weapons and shoot the generals. They hoped for big casualties on all sides so that the morale would break and soldiers mutiny. \n7) But this very anti-nationalist feeling in the real Left meant that they were a group of anti-nationals drawn from every country in Europe and were truly `international anti-nationals'. In practice, this meant two vital things a) they were drawn from every country in Europe. \n8) b) since they were anti-national to every country, they collected subsidies from all countries to sabotage the enemy. Thus Lenin was subsidised and transported by the German foreign office with supplies to Finland to start a revolution in Russia, and sign a `defeatist peace.' \n9) While Lenin was hobnobbing with the Germans, Liebknecht, Munzenberg and Luxembourg were offered subsidies by UK to break German morale. Sitting in neutral Switzerland/Scandinavia, they controlled a lot of resources, people and propaganda machinery across all of Europe. \n10) The end result was that, thanks to the subsidies offered to the Left by the various belligerent countries, the Left was the only one which profited from the war hugely. All belligerent countries saw them as allies against the `enemy', when the Left was enemy of everyone. \n11) This also meant a truly `international' Left as can be gauged by the following incident. When Munzenberg was arrested in Switzerland [he kicked up such a ruckus that even neutral Switzerland acted against him], there were demonstrations against it in France, Austria, etc. \n12) Further, in their own interest, the Leftists cooperated with each other. They were all traitors to their own countries, and consequently, they developed a solidarity of treason. Further, it was safe to demonstrate against Russia in Germany, in France against Germany, etc. \n13) What does all this mean for today? It is important to realise the depth of the Left's internationalism, how it comes about, what is the basis of this, and most importantly, what can be done about this. To combat an enemy, one must understand their strengths and weaknesses. \n14) The strengths of the Left are the following.\na) It is truly international, has been so from the earliest days, is a very powerful ideological weapon aimed at nations and civilisations from its earliest days. It is a brotherhood of treason, where traitors' interests converge. \n15) b) The resources of the Left are colossal. For over a century, they have utilised every venture, every nation, every business to find funding for their organisation. They have amassed huge resources, and since every nation has enemies, will always find some resources. \n16) c) Since the Left is truly an international international, it cannot be combated in any one country. If it is destroyed in one country [this is a very optimistic scenario], they will just flee to another and begin the same destructive work from across the borders. \n17) In fact, the above was the experience of the European nations in WW1 and just before. Traitors would just flee to Switzerland, Scandinavia, etc and continue their work from there. Russia, Germany, etc did expend huge resources to combat the Left nationally. They failed. \n18) The Left will always align with any anti-national element, no matter how foul. For them, these are useful in bringing down the nation states, and are thus, allies. This, then, is the basis for the Left's love for Islamists. The Islamists are destructive and thus, allies. \n19) What, then, can be done to combat the Left? Multiple things.\na) Patriotism, nationalism, and cultural strength are the anathema of the Left. As long as a people is patriotic and culturally strong, they will not destroy their societies and Leftists can be contained. \n20) Leftists are international, so anyone who tries to fight the Leftists must also evolve a significant amount of international cooperation. This involves alliances between countries about how to contain the destructive Left. This would weaken the power of the Left. \n21) Democracies are uniquely vulnerable to the Left, since they are, by definition, free societies. The Left does not respect it-they just see it as a weakness to be exploited, just as the Islamists do. So, Leftist organisations must be identified and shunned, across nations. \n22) Useful idiots are the heart of the Left. These useful idiots give intellectual, social and political [usually because they are genuinely attached to a cause] cover to the real traitors. This is why the Left tries so hard to brainwash people. Deny this by educating people. \n23) The habit of funding Leftist organisations to promote mischief in other countries must be shunned. There must be positive and negative inducements for countries/organisations over these treacherous organisations. Those countries/orgs which fund Left must be penalised/shamed. \n24) All countries have genuine problems. This is a fact of life. Marginalised sections in all nations will be vulnerable. Their problems must be addressed within the ambit of the nation. Organisations must be responsible nationally. International orgs must be shunned. \n25) Educate people across the board how funding the Left is self-destructive. The bulk of the money for Left comes from non-Left, because Left pitches their causes attractively. Point out that what the Left is doing to other countries will be done at home too by their comrades. \n26) Civilisational responses and alliances are necessary to weaken the Left. The Islamist-Leftist alliance is here to stay. They are made for each other, since they both desire the destruction of the society. We need to coordinate with other civilisations to contain the Left. \n27) Finally, it must be realised that the war with the Leftists cannot be completely won. Leftism is an inherent problem in mankind. Treason, sadism, destructive behaviour, etc, are not going to be eradicated-they are part of human nature. But they can be contained, controlled."<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'floi3u'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/floi3u/interesting_perspective_on_international_role_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What is Hindutva? Why Hindutva alone is our form of Indian Nationalism?'<br />Body: 'Hindutva= Hinduness.  While most people some how think that 1st partition of Bharat happened in 1947, 1st partition actually happened in the year 711, when Raja Dahir was defeated by Mohammed Bin Qasim established a mini Islamic state by forcibly converting Hindus. As converted Hindus felt that only one God named Allah should exist and other Gods should not be allowed to exist, And Hindus could no longer access certain parts of Sindh. And hence, this is the 1st partition of Bharat. It is not compulsory for Britishers to draw a artificial line to do partition. So, due to increase in Muslim %, partition of Bharat is still ongoing even today.\n\nRSS will destroy caste system using Hindutva movement started by Swami Vivekananda.\n\n1st part of Hindutva says “Ekam Sath Vipraha Bahuda Vadanti” which means “truth is one and there are multiple names given to truth and multiple ways to reach the truth” Some people claim atheism is the truth. Some claim agnosticism is the truth. Some claim Allah,Jesus,Vishnu are the truth.However all people following different paths belong to one large family called Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. So, you can be an atheist but call yourself as Hindu. You can pray to Allah,Jesus and Vishnu but still call yourself as a Hindu.\n\n2nd part of Hindutva says, Hindu should be the only caste everyone everyone should have. All castes of Brahmin,Kshatriya,Vaishya,Shudra and Dalit have to destroyed and replaced with one caste called Hindu. This 2nd part was given by Veer Savarkar.\n\n3rd part of Hindutva says, there should be political unity and military unity of Hindus and that all Hindus should get organised and have political meetings every week similar to how Muslims have political meetings every Friday Afternoon. This was given by Swami Vivekananda. This is the main goal of RSS which is Hindu Sangathan. When entire Hindu Samaj comes under RSS, RSS will cease to exist.\n\n\nAll Hindus naturally follow 1st part of Hindutva  but not 2nd and 3rd part of Hindutva. RSS has all religious groups working for it. Abdul Kalam used to visit RSS headquarters in Nagpur. Please join it and preach Hindutva to everyone you see offline.'<br />Author: 'phanisai97'  id: 'fl98ax'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fl98ax/what_is_hindutva_why_hindutva_alone_is_our_form/</li>

(Bangalore/Queens Road in my  case)\n\n1. [http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home](http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home) CLOSE any rubbish pop-ups. Look to the right-top: 'Registered User'. I had forgotten my password but fortunately I remembered my secret Question so I could recover it via my e-mail ID. My Phone number was also AWOL since I don't use a mobile. User-ID is your PAN number.\n2. Once you get that working, you need to figure out your Assessing Officer. Not his name - these scumbags like to stay anonymous SO YOU will NEVER know who the mysterious AO is.. kind of like the Mafia. \n3. [http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home](http://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home) look for 'Know Your TAN|AO' Bottom-right. You need to have a mobile working for this since it uses 2xOTP both email and mobile OTP-codes.\n4. The AO is basically the Type, Range, AO Number. Once you get that tuple 3-ary of numbers, you got to Google Search all the PDFs to figure out where your ITO Building is.\n5. Then you got to google search the building to locate phone numbers - they have plenty that work because the ITO collects money no matter what you say - you have to go to court to change that. They operate like the Regional Passport Office in that sense - a law onto themselves BECAUSE THE COURTS are deliberately slow.\n6. Also depending on your building they can be very rude or very polite because your company pays them bribes to keep things functioning. (kind of like the Police as well - bigger the company, larger the bribe and therefore more politeness from the govt)\n7. If you call up the Assessing Officer he could very well lie to you about his name because the ITO directory is usually kept outdated  '2016' in my case. I was told XYZ was no there anymore and POR is now in charge. Then he will cooly lie and telly you AO stands for Administrative Officer in charge of Administration and that you should speak to the ITO when you ask for specific work to get done.\n8. So he gave me 4 numbers but I was supposed to speak to ITO1 - the 1st number - none of the other numbers worked at all.\n9. Anyhow she said I needed to come in and speak personally - my experience with the Passport Office was not any better - ultimately you are forced to chose between taking it to court or paying these mother-fuckers. +Coronavirus\n\nIn my case, this matter/dispute was settled my parent years ago so I SUSPECT this is due to my criticism on PGPORTAL - where I rightly pointed out that lunatics can spread corona-virus - unless the govt made it clear that restraints/isolation were allowed. The timing matches: I complain on PGPortal, they send IT-email in a matter of hours.\n\nSo be aware that if you speak too loudly in a 'democracy' called India, the govt can levy a fine on you by raising old tax issues :) and suppress free speech - in my case a small amount 2k - which I happily paid with the only sourness being that it will be misspent. RPO was a 5k hit. \n\nIn both cases I made them wait years because it was trumped up but what you are rewarding is the sheer arrogance of unproductive bastards who think they are clever.

      <li>Title::: 'Full analysis report on Scindia joining BJP'<br />Body: 'Scindia’s recent move to leave Congress and join BJP has changed the political landscape, national generally and statewise in particular. \n\nIt is clear that BJP has gained and Congress has suffered a loss. Congress has lost a big leader, a state govt, and most important, face. Its political weight has decreased and image has taken a hit yet again. Not that its image was of some great party recovering from a streak of loss but still. Congress is being seen, for quite some time, as a pasrty which cannot keep its house in order and unfit to be a challenger to the BJP. Whatever Congress has lost BJP has gained. \n\nGains and losses of the key political figures of the state. \n\n1. Jyotiradiyta Scindia- He stands to gain the most from this development. He has gained a Rajya Sabha seat. A friendly govt in Bhopal where his appointees would be getting key ministries which would help him establish his foothold in state politics and his own Chambal region in particular. All this will also give him oppostunity to get work done and exercise power in his area of influence, the two things all powerful people must able to do (which he was unable to in the Congress govt he was part of) or risk see the power they hold turn into an illusion \n\nHe is in winning team now. His challenge would be to make his place in an organisation which has many other local leaders although the level of groupism that existed in Congress is not here. \n\n2. Kamalnath- he is the biggest loser. He would lose his position as CM. He has made powerful enemies like Sanjay Pathak, who is said to be the richest MLA in Madhya Pradesh, by demolishing his hotels and cancelling his mining licence etc. He has no dinasty and does not fit in any caste equation in the state so it would be difficut for him to hold the gains he made thus far in Congress party organisation and in state. After he is gone his son would not have any caste to back him up. He would have a small pocket borough.\n\nGandhis will hold him responsible for all this while not taking any responsibilty themselves and will be made to pay for losing a state govt. \n\n3. Digvijay Singh- Another big gainer. Although his son lost a ministerial position this move instantly dissolved Scindia faction from the party and considerably weakened Kamalnath faction. Now the most powerful family which is also well connected and has a caste base within the Congress in Madhya Pradesh is the Digvijay Singh family.\n\nAlthough Digvijay Singh is still very unpopular in Madhya pradesh especially amont govt servants his grip on Congress party organisation is very strong owing to his being a minister in state assembley once and Chief Minister of the state twice. \n\nDigvijay Singh’s family has been landed gentry in Madhya Pradesh for generations. He comes from a caste important in Madhya Pradesh and is rooted in Madhya Pradesh unlike Kamalnath who came from outside. \n\nHe has a big family meaning more connections. His son Jayvardhan Singh is better known, more popular and doing generally better than Kamalnath’s son NakulNath. Now in Madhya Pradesh, Congress means Digvijay Singh faction. \n\n4. Sivraj Singh Chauhan – Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s has not gained. He has merely recovered what he lost. People’s perception of him is the same that is to say not great. Mama has gained lost ground. He will be CM again. He got lost power back and that is it. He did not suffer any long term loss when the BJP lost in the state. His loss was the immidiate loss of going out of power but there is no major change in his political stature unlike the other three gentleman from the Congress. He is neither too popular nor unpopular amongst the people which is strange considering he has been CM for two terms. \n\nHis grip on power and party is strong enough and he is very consilliatory, keeps everyone happy or atleast tries to. What equation develops between him and Scindia is yet to be seen but that is in the future. There is a possibility of conflict but considering Mama has been in the party and power longer and has a non-threatening demenaur unlike Scindia scion puts him in a safe position.'<br />Author: 'l6_6l'  id: 'fl8l72'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fl8l72/full_analysis_report_on_scindia_joining_bjp/</li>

      <li>Title::: "My first RTI request about the statistics of illegal immigrants , behind CAA. I'm a Hindu and Anti-CAA"<br />Body: 'TLDR : I write about why I\'m anti-CAA. Because of Covid-19, I write about how we can protest online using social media and  filing RTI requests.  My own RTI request is shown in the image linked at the end.\n\nDisclaimer : I\'m a Gandhian in and out. In Asimov\'s words "Violence is the last resort of the incompetent". And I believe I\'m not incompetent.\n\nFull post:\nOwing to Covid-19, us anti-CAA protesters can\'t protest in large crowds. I describe below why I am an anti-CAA protester, followed by what we should try to do, to keep the protests active.\n\nI am an anti-CAA protester, because I believe in absolute equality and secularism.\n\nIn several recent debates, my friends have told me that it doesn\'t affect Indian Muslims. \n\nWell, here\'s the thing - secularism is a basic human value. Secularism treats each human as a human, nothing else. It is debatable whether CAA combined with NRC affects Indian Muslims - we will definitely disagree. But, I am against CAA because it excludes some religion - it doesn\'t matter which religion or which country it is. It just excludes some religion, and I\'m against that. \n\nDoes CAA + NRC affect Indian Muslims? Its debatable. Does it affect some Muslims in the whole world? Yes. Well, that is unacceptable to me. I have been raised in a religious Hindu family as a secular person who doesn\'t discriminate against anybody. Their nationality doesn\'t matter to us. \n\nDiscrimination against Muslims in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh is also unsecular, because its against some religion. Secularism doesn\'t consider nationality, and it shouldn\'t.\n\nI have been told, that because Indian Muslims won\'t be affected, its still secular. I think those people don\'t understand secularism or are in denial. Secularism has nothing to do with nationality. We just cannot discriminate based on religion, no matter what country and what the circumstances are.\n\nNow, I am someone who\'s been rejected a US Visa 2 times. I am currently applying for a UK Visa to pursue a PhD, and I have been advised by friends and family to not attend anti-CAA protests lest my Visa gets denied. Well, if it gets denied, doesn\'t matter, I have to accept the situation - we have a great future in India.\n\nBecause of the Covid-19 situation, I don\'t attend public anti-CAA protests. And I would advise fellow anti-CAA protesters to take a break and be healthy. Its not a sprint, its a marathon. They\'re not going to revert CAA - our fight is to inform the population about secularism and discrimination so that they vote for equality next time. Lets not cause life and death scenarios by organizing large public protests that cause the virus to spread. Lets follow self isolation, for now.\n\nBut we can do something else - we can protest online. We can post on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and engage people and government officials. I filed my first RTI request today, because that\'s how I want to protest- ask questions.\n\nMy RTI request is shown in this image linked at the end. My questions were about the population of illegal immigrants, the terrorist acts committed by them and their occupation in Indian workforce. Because CAA has to have some statistical basis, right?\n\nWell, if CAA has a reason, they should have numbers to prove it. It cannot just be based on religion and emotions.\n\nI would advice fellow anti-CAA protestors to do the same. Use social media and/or file RTI requests.\n\nMy first RTI https://imgur.com/gallery/Q7lPcf8'<br />Author: 'nefrpitou'  id: 'fl5tkg'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fl5tkg/my_first_rti_request_about_the_statistics_of/</li>

Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word "Madhusūdana" is significant in this verse. Lord Kṛṣṇa killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Kṛṣṇa to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress—the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a śūdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a kṣatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gītā was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This realization is made possible by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.  \n.  \n**Question 1 : Why the word "Madhusūdana" is significant in this verse ?**  \n**.**  \n**Question 2 : Why Arjuna\'s conduct was not befitting that of a kṣatriya ? What is the main subject matter of this chapter ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcs0ar23rjn41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baf67d40b29e3c3615caa35d22338d1dbb6e4f38\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fl2x8g'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fl2x8g/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_21/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Excerpts] In Defense of Muivah'<br />Body: '&gt; Having said that, as people of a Nation whose sovereignty is “suppressed”, it becomes pertinent to scrutinise ourselves and point out traitors as and when necessary so as to avoid being deceived by such people. It is also necessary to identify malicious dissents that are scripted by none other than our enemy (read India) themselves with the sole intention of undermining and weakening the integrity of our fight for our sovereignty.\n\n\n&gt; We must know that in the mid to late 20th Century when The Naga movement for sovereignty was at its peak it was greatly undermined not by the Indian Army but by few Nagas just for gaining personal wealth and political power.\n\n\n&gt; What we must know is that 100 years is a lifetime for an individual but for a Nation even 1000 years is negligible. What we Nagas achieved in terms of conceptualizing, mobilising, and asserting our sovereign right to a Nation State is nothing short of a miracle.\xa0\n\n\n&gt; It is our duty to remember our history and know that no one is entitled to sell the sovereignty of a Nation just to accommodate their personal whims and delusional wishes. Any individual or group that peddles the idea of early settlement at the cost of sovereignty must be ignored. Of course we must be vigilant for such individuals and groups are perfect breeding ground of puppets for the oppressors (read India) in perpetuating the suppression of our Nation’s sovereignty.\n\n\n&gt; Having realised that they were in no position to engage in a war with the Nagas they changed their tactics and eventually forced Nagas away from the battlefield and into the dialogue. As such today we are in their territory; a political dialogue, a skill which they have mastered for centuries if not for thousands of years.\n\n\n&gt; In light of such realisation we must simply observe, learn and always be vigilant, we must persevere and most importantly we must not give in to feverish pressures exerted by traitors. Time and again Nagas have risen up to the challenges and excelled and it is this confidence that should motivate us to persevere in this game/fight with India and know that this is not the time for questioning the legitimacy of our Government that stands for our sovereignty.'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'fk6zgr'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fk6zgr/excerpts_in_defense_of_muivah/</li>

Two brothers, Pranab Sain and Moloy Sain were murdered and their mother Mriganayani was forced to eat rice which was stained with her sons\' blood. A tutor Jiten Ray, who was present there at the time was also killed. Nabakumar Sain the eldest son of the family had his eyes gouged out and acid poured in his eyes in the attack, and he was killed a year later by beheading.

Where do we draw the poverty line and is it possible to ensure only everyone below this line gets assistance? Secondly, is it even remotely possible to stop rich people from pretending to be poor or do an arm twist with govt official and siphon off the masks and sanitizers? Thirdly, why is this measure more important than many others, especially increasing the number of tests and reducing the processing time to find out who has the virus?\n\n**Many Left-minded Indians don't seem to think about the feasibility of a certain policy and whether or not its the best policy for maximum number of Indians.** India is a low-income country with scarce land and resources; it's beyond stupid to be affirmative instead of utilitarian in such conditions.

      <li>Title::: 'Can we create a list of historical state-sanctioned censorship in India?'<br />Body: 'I\'ve had a lot of "who is more authoritarian? BJP/Congress?" discussions with friends recently, and it just turns into a competition of who can list more things. Also, I\'ve lately learned of several atrocities by Congress and communist governments that few people seem to know about.\n\nI thought it would be interesting to compile a list of atrocities and instances of censorship and violations of freedom of expression and belief in post-Independence Indian history.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. Entries must be related to either **(a)** rights-violations\\* of individuals or groups on grounds of opinion, religion, or political orientation **(b)** rights-violations\\* of members of a specific group based on factors beyond their control (e.g. ethnicity, caste, gender, religion of birth) (c) generic criminal atrocities\n2. \\*Rights-violations include: **killing** (right to life), **arrests** (right to movement), **ban on entering or leaving country** (right to movement), **confiscation of property** (property), **differential taxation or regulation** (property), **censorship** (productive activity and trade). Note censorship does not include deplatforming, just to set the bar high.\n3. Rights-violations must have been **unjustified**. Actions in self-defense/encounters, riot control and public nuisance (permitless protests) control, arrests for threatening speech or libel (false claims) do not count. \n4. Entries must pertain to *state-sanctioned* events -- otherwise there are way too many riots to list. This includes: **(a)** actions that were ordered or funded by government **(b)** events where the government deliberately failed in its duty to intervene to protect the rights of individuals (*but not counting pacifism against terror or military attacks*) or impeded the resolution of.\n5. By the "state", I mean any Indian **central, state or local level governmental** ***authority***, including **courts**, but *not* foreign governments, individual bureaucrats, policemen, army members. **Political parties** are allowed even though not members of the government.\n6. Events must have taken place in India, after 1947, and may be from either side of the political spectrum.\n\nI\'ll get us started with the ones I\'m aware of (add more in the comments):\n\n**Atrocities**\n\n|Year|State actors complicit|Event|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1962|Central Govt (Nehru)|Internment of Chinese Indians|\n|1975|Central Govt (Indira Gandhi)|Emergency|\n|1979|Bengal Govt (Jyoti Basu)|Marichjhapi incident|\n|1984|Central Govt (Rajiv Gandhi)|Anti-Sikh Riots|\n|1989|Kashmir Govt (Faroq Abd), Central Govt (Rajiv Gandhi)|Kashmiri Pundit expulsion|\n|1990|UP Govt (MS Yadav)|Ayodhya massacre|\n|2010s|Kerala Govt (CPI M)|Student union "torture rooms"|\n\n**Censorship**\n\nThis will probably be too many to list. There are plenty of censorship events by Congress (especially of films on terrorism, Islam etc.) I\'ve heard of but can\'t recall to list.

      <li>Title::: "No one appreciates Indian spontaneity, but everyone talks about India's lack of discipline"<br />Body: "For those who don't understand what I mean, spontaneity and discipline are two distinct methods that help humans in their daily pursuits. Research shows that we use different parts of our brain when using either of the two skills.\n\nFor example, if your goal is to read a book, you can do it the disciplined way, which could be to plan the time spent to read and break, write summaries after each chapter and finally explain what you read to someone to make sure you completely understood it. Or you could do it the spontaneous way, which is to just read the damn book and improvise along the way if you didn't understand. I'm sure you have friends who are either more disciplined or spontaneous. **Basically, both methods have their own benefits and flaws, and their importance vary depending on the activity.** \n\nThere are also entire cultures that give importance to one or the other. Germans and Japanese value discipline and adherence to rules, as a result, they became very good at activities like manufacturing, finance, scientific research, etc. In contrast, Spanish and Italians use their spontaneity to become creative and artistic, in the areas of art, food, beauty, architecture, entertainment, etc. You may have already guessed where India lies in the spectrum of Spontaneity-Discipline; **a bit too much towards the left side**. What's worse is that the disciplined Indians tend to migrate to developed countries. \n\nIndians' general lack of discipline has caused foreigners to think of us as incompetent, unruly and bound for failure. Look at the comments of some foreigners on India's response to the recent coronavirus outbreak; they're so dismissive of India's efforts despite a fantastic job by India's medical personnel thus far. They're also very surprised as to how India's reported cases and death rate is so low. **What they fail to realize is, spontaneity can also be an effective tool in dealing a pandemic.** For example, an Indian doctor is forced to make spontaneous judgments all the time on which patient should be treated first, because of overcrowding in hospitals. Over time, this makes him/her experts in reading patients in a split second. Doctors in developed countries, who didn't develop this skill, now find themselves drowned with too many cases to attend to. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Indians absolutely need to learn to become more disciplined. The state and locality must be ashamed of themselves for not providing good healthcare and the citizens must take health more seriously by preventing bad eating and lifestyle habits. **However, Indian spontaneity needs more appreciation, because the country almost exclusively runs on it.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'fixct3'<br />Score:39<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fixct3/no_one_appreciates_indian_spontaneity_but/</li>

They were to move with three genuine Ladakhi yak herders. During a briefing at the Headquarters in Leh, Basera was told that it was crucial to maintain utmost secrecy about the mission.\n\n&gt; The Military Intelligence (MI) instructed them not to carry any documents that could disclose their identities, no notes should be taken. They were asked to memorise the map and the route: “They had to move in the easterly direction from Leh for about 250-300 km, till they reached the expected location of the new Chinese built road, in Aksai Chin. Initially, they would pass over difficult, undulating terrain, till they crossed the Karakoram Mountain Range and Shyok River,” wrote Basera’s son. Their mission was of national importance, said their handlers in the MI.\n\n\n&gt; After a long and adventurous journey, they finally entered Aksai Chin. **On the third day, one of the herders suddenly pulled Basera's shoulder and showed him a dark line on the horizon; it was the road.** The next morning, they walked in the direction of the road: “The otherwise sluggish yaks too moved forward with renewed energy, matching the sudden spring in the step of their handlers!”\n\n**Spanner In The Works**\n\n&gt; **At noon,** they were now near the raised road, **they mentally noted every detail of the road that was not yet tarred**.

Usmani explained that the Prophet had not established Pakistan\r\nin his native Mecca but had instead migrated to Medina since he was convinced\r\nthat Pakistan could be established only in an area where Muslims could practice\r\ntheir religion with complete freedom and without any external hindrances...\n\n&gt;Usmani next noted the unprecedented unity\r\nand cooperation that had developed between the followers of the Prophet during\r\nthe creation of ‘Pakistan’ in Medina. These were the inhabitants of Medina (ansar)\r\nand the migrants (muhajirin) of Mecca who had left behind their shrines, their\r\nfamilies, and dependents in order to develop Pakistan. A similar unity was\r\ndeveloping between Indian Muslims. The muhajirin from the minority provinces\r\nsuch as the UP, were sacrificing their lives for the formation of Pakistan even\r\nthough they themselves were neither its inhabitants nor did they indeed intend\r\nto permanently leave their homelands. Usmani however declared that their\r\nsacrifices would not be in vain. Just as Medina had provided a base for the\r\neventual victory of Islam in Arabia and the wide world beyond, Pakistan would\r\npave the way for the triumphal return of Islam as the ruling power over the\r\nentire subcontinent.'<br />Author: 'sadhunath'  id: 'fi0kvd'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fi0kvd/the_new_medina_the_ideology_of_pakistan/</li>

Suppose there are 1000 covid cases in India, this would mean it would take around 2 weeks and about 2 million tests to detect 1 virus case in India. When you conduct 2 million tests, the chance of there being a false positive, even with 99.999% accuracy is 1 - 0.99999\\^(2000000), ie for all practical purposes 100%. Basically we would end up detecting more false positives than actual cases and create a ruckus over nothing. It would also take 2 full weeks to detect 1 case. This is an insane waste of money, time, and resources, which can be put to better measure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally I do not think there is too much underreporting in India yet (it might explode), because we haven't seen many cases exported from India or any famous celebs or ministers getting infections.

In such corrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the ancestors.**  \n**PURPORT**  \nAccording to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Viṣṇu, because eating the remnants of food offered to Viṣṇu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of prasādam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the Bhāgavatam:  \ndevarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛnāṁ pitṝṇāṁna kiṅkaro nāyamṛṇī ca rājansarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁgato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kartam  \n"Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers." (Bhāg. 11.5.41) Such obligations are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  \n**Question 1 : What kind of family traditions Arjuna is referring to in this verse ?

      <li>Title::: "I see a lot of irrational criticism of Nehru here and hence here's a copy-paste of an excellent answer from Quora and I'd like to hear you guys' thoughts on each of the points"<br />Body: "# Question\n\n**Why is Nehru supposedly not liked by some Indians?**\n\n# Answer\n\nby [**Prasanth Valsan K**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Prasanth-Valsan-K)**,** Malayali, Hindu, Beef lover, Neither a Bhakt nor a Congress supporter\n\n**Background:**  \nNow a days, there is a lot of hatred and animosity towards Nehru. Most of it comes from a small but highly visible group of Indians- Youth who belong to middle and upper middle class families and hailing from states where politics is dominated by communities like the Jats, the Patels, the Rajputs and so on. The animosity mainly exists in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and parts of UP where the right wing has great sway. These regions also primarily subscribe to the view that India belongs to Hindus only and the muslims and Christians are outsiders. Most of the people who have these misconceptions blindly follow the right wing idea that Nehru prevented India from becoming some 'great Hindu society'. Much of this animosity comes from the fact that Nehru's early reforms in the 5os and 60s deprived these communities of their feudal powers, atleast to some extent.  \nSo i will attempt to list some (coming from the South my view will be different from the Northern ones):\n\n**Misconception:**   \nToday's India would have been much better if Sardar Patel had become the first PM rather than Nehru  \n**Reality:**  \nIndia became independent in 1947. Sarday Patel died in 1950. Even if he had become PM, he would have been so for 3 years. After his death Nehru would have taken over anyway. So this doesn't carry any water. Yet this foolish idea that Patel would have made a better PM is repeated by today's 'Gen Y'.\n\n**Misconception:**  \nNehru was a terrible PM.  \n**Reality:**  \nWhen Nehru became the PM, he had zero experience running a democratic nation. None of his ministers or aides had any experience running a democracy. Prior to 1947, India was never a democracy. Considering how many African nations and even our Western neighbor has flopped after gaining independence, Nehru really did a commendable job.  \nA strong parliamentary system and an independent judiciary were created along with foundations for industrialization. He was elected 4 times! The Sangh had NO ONE to counter his influence. All they had were some Sadhus and Sanyasis who said all the laws needed for society are present in the Vedas! We can really thank they did not have any power in those formative years, else we would be another Pakistan! It is really arrogant of the current generation (who were born 3 or 4 decades after Nehru died) to think the people then were all idiots to elect him (4 times!). Imagine how it would be if 50 years from now, the youth criticize us for electing Modi!\n\n**Misconception:**  \nNehru was anti Hindu  \n**Reality:**  \nNehru played a great part in reforming the Hindu society. Divorce and Property rights were provided to Hindu women. Nehru was instrumental in removing the feudal setup that existed in many parts of India, where a few upper caste families owned most of the land, had most of the money and power. The states that implemented these measures properly like TN, Kerala, AP and Karnataka are way ahead of the states that did not like Bihar, MP, UP, Rajasthan (what people now refer to as BIMARU).  \nThe civil code was not extended to Muslims because it was basically to prevent Jinnah from getting more sway on the Muslims who stayed behind in India post partition.\n\n**Misconception:**  \nNehru created dynastic politics  \n**Reality:**  \nIt was not Nehru but his daughter Indira Gandhi who did this. It is true that Gandhi wanted to disband the INC after 1947. Nehru disagreed. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 and the Congress lived on. It was Indira Gandhi who cemented dynastic politics in the Congress and in India by   \n1 promoting a cult of personality ( 'India is Indra and Indra is India')  \n2 Indiscriminately using Article 356 to dismiss state governments when the people elected a non congress government at the state level.   \n3 Appointing Gandhi family loyalists as CMs of states etc.   \nMost local political parties which are present today like Trinamool Congress, NCP, Tamil Mannila Congress etc are the result of Indira's policies. Nehru had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Misconception:**  \nNehru was responsible for the defeat in the 1962 war.  \n**Reality:**  \nIt is true Nehru made the mistake of thinking that no nation will use war as a means of settling disputes after the horrors of WW2 (concentration camps, atomic bombs etc), certainly not China because China itself suffered a lot under Japanese occupation. The Chinese invasion was a nasty suprise. But the reality is China did not gain any territory from the war even though it got a military victory.   \nAlso the war enabled India is galvanize its diverse population. One positive outcome of the war was that Nehru passed the Secession Act. It enabled to silence the demands for a separate country 'Dravida Nadu' for the Southern people (This is almost forgotten now that the DMK was created to demand a separate country for Dravidians!).  \nAlso only a few know about another small scale conflict we had with China in 1967 dubbed 'The Chola Incident' where the Indian army decisively defeated the PLA in Sikkim. Close to 300 PLA soldiers were killed and the Indian Army had 88 casualties.\n\n**Misconception:**  \nNehru ruined India and The Sangh Parivar will make India great.  \n**Reality:**  \nThe Sangh parivar had no role in the freedom struggle. Sardar Patel who the Sangh idolizes belonged to the Congress party! I will put forth some points:  \n1 Most of the leaders in the right wing parties have only a few years of experience in national level politics. Experience does not include being in opposition. It means being in power.   \nExample: When the IC 814 plane was hijacked, the NDA government had no idea what to do. In the end we meekly released 5 terrorists in return for the hostages.  \n2 Sangh Parivar has only a small presence outside the Hindi speaking states. In Lok Sabha 2014, with the exception of Karnataka, the BJP got single digit seats in all non Hindi speaking states- TN, Kerala, AP, Telengana, Odisha, WB etc. Its reach is very limited outside the Hindi speaking states. Unfortunately the national media focuses mainly on this region, especially New Delhi and Mumbai and ignores the rest of the places.  \n3 The Hindu Mahasabha was founded in 1925 with the aim of making India into a Hindu theocratic state with Manu Smriti as the constitution. Their idea of India is completely at odds with what India is today, a plural, secular society.  \n4 The Sangh parties (especially the fringe outfits) have no tolerance to dissenting voices. The recent violence over beef and ink attacks on citizens is an example to it. While this grabs headlines and makes the middle and upper class Indians in the metros beating their chests with pride for saving Hindu India, among the poorer sections, this has no resonance. BJP's popularity is already waning in the states and this can be clearly seen in Bihar.  \n5 The Sangh's core philosophy that all Indians are Hindus, this is a nation of Hindus with Muslims and Christians being outsiders has no takers outside the Jat, Rajput and Maratha dominated states in Northern India.\n\n**Misconception:** Nehru turned down the permanent seat in the UNSC to India and offered it to China.\n\n**Reality:** There was no such serious offer! The UNSC was formed in 1945 when India was a British colony. The Republic of China was a part of the UNSC in 1945. The ROC was overthrown in 1949 and the Perople’s Republic of China was established. It was only a question of transferring the permanent membership from the ROC to the PRC. India had absolutely no say in this whole matter. The UNSC was controlled by the victorious countries of WW2. India was a recently decolonized nation. It is not as if the USA, the USSR, Britain and France were waiting for Nehru’s word on what has to be done with China.\n\nSo, in summary, the Sangh Parivar had lost the war to fashion India into the way it wanted in the 50s to Nehru and now tries to paint Nehru as the source of all the evils that exist today. These misconceptions are accepted by the middle and upper middle class Indians in certain parts of India- people who were born 3-4 decades after Nehru died!\n\nOriginal link: [https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Nehru-supposedly-not-liked-by-some-Indians](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Nehru-supposedly-not-liked-by-some-Indians)"<br />Author: 'GuruDev1000'  id: 'fhuzxl'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fhuzxl/i_see_a_lot_of_irrational_criticism_of_nehru_here/</li>

The varṇāśrama religion's principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to Cāṇakya Paṇḍit, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varṇāśrama system. On the failure of such varṇāśrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.   \n\n\n**Question 1 : How women can help in the spiritual progress of human society ?**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7gd0z5o89m41.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fde136ff428a145a0a651c55501fda53852950f\n\n  \nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'fhhgt9'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fhhgt9/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_140/</li>

And based on current statistics, the worst affected places are roughly in the same latitude and climate zone. North Iran, North Italy and South Korea have a roughly similar climate to Wuhan. \n\nWhy warm &amp; wet climate is safer is because in warm climates, people don't congregate indoors in one place for a long time, especially in bars and clubs during nighttime (or religious places). As for humidity, the virus particle falls to the ground very quickly in a humid place and so has a lower chance of getting transmitted to another human body. \n\nMost of India has a warm and dry climate, especially during this time of the year. **However, parts of North India that are under the** ***Humid Subtropical*** **classification may need to be cautious, because that's the same climate classification as Wuhan.**  The map of Humid Subtropical climate zone is as follows in India. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l0c7qs0j69m41.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9082531fafc42c28261e5884afa6640b7d05bf87"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'fhhbp7'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fhhbp7/does_indias_climate_help_it_against_virus/</li>

Why he is addressing Lord Krishna as "Mādhava" ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord Rāma was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom, (Rāma-rājya), but Lord Rāma never showed any cowardice. Rāvaṇa was an aggressor against Rāma because he kidnapped Rāma\'s wife, Sītā, but Lord Rāma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\'s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\'s addressing of Kṛṣṇa as "Mādhava," or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to Kṛṣṇa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. Kṛṣṇa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 1.36, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf1wasvehtl41.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c355b87aa7ca3ed0a5c14fe451761d9843f877c1\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

It's interesting how both Hindustani and Carnatic styles originate from the Sama Veda, however got evolved into two noticeably different art forms. The main reason for that is because, post Islamic invasion of the Indian Subcontinent, Northern music was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian music. **That makes Carnatic music to be the closest resemblance of how music was performed during Vedic times.** \n\nThis resemblance can be seen in many other aspects of life, including genetics. The oldest known human settlement in India are labelled by geneticists as Ancient Ancestral South Indians (AASI). Today, almost every Indian has the AASI gene but **the more South you go, the greater the percentage gets**. This also means that South Indians look most similar to Ancient Indians compared to any other region in the Subcontinent, except for some very elusive tribes in Central India. \n\nI'm not trying to stroke Southern ego by making this post; globalization and intermixing has its benefits.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 1.32-35'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How the difference between the material life and transcendental life has been exemplified in this verse ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Arjuna has addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa as Govinda because Kṛṣṇa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one\'s own senses—then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\'s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different.

Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and our friends. What should we gain, O Kṛṣṇa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\'s land, and 6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kṣatriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord Rāma was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom, (Rāma-rājya), but Lord Rāma never showed any cowardice. Rāvaṇa was an aggressor against Rāma because he kidnapped Rāma\'s wife, Sītā, but Lord Rāma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\'s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\'s addressing of Kṛṣṇa as "Mādhava," or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to Kṛṣṇa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. Kṛṣṇa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Arjuna did not want to take any action against his own kinsmen ? Why he is addressing Lord Krishna as "Mādhava" ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vve76f18kll41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5e684f25ae3fab68a36fec108051d5c0e8265e\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ffqvzz'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ffqvzz/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_136/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Malaysian PM, European refugee crisis (again), and Mata Hari'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread! This is the place where we discuss all the events from around the world, which do not have to be connected to India. Here are some stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Malaysia gets new PM in surprise move](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/malaysian-pm-sworn-in-amid-questions-over-legitimacy)\n\nIn a surprise move, Malaysia\'s 94 year old PM Mahathir Mohamad resigned after his coalition government collapsed in less than two years. This came after moves within his coalition to oust him, allegedly by his ally and former PM Anwar Ibrahim. The coalition itself was a tricky one, as Mahathir had imprisoned Anwar on charges of sodomy in 2008. The new PM, Muhyiddin Yassin, has described himself as a Malay nationalist who opposes concessions to the ethnic minority Chinese and Indian communities in the country. His coalition includes a party that favours strict Sharia law in the country, despite being only 60% Muslim.\n\n2. [Nepal \'lights up\' for Shivratri](https://apnews.com/eb2f19e99e314662ef4f46df339b3d05)\n\nNepal, the other Hindu-majority country in the subcontinent, marked the holy festival of Shivratri with widespread consumption of marijuana. Holy men, devotees, and even some tourists could be seen smoking the substance near the Pashupati Temple. Marijuana is considered an important part of worshiping Shiva and was legal in Nepal till 1976, but now carries a 1 month prison sentence for users. Despite the ban, no arrests were made and police only enforced safety and decorum. A group of ruling MPs recently filed a petition to legalize the substance. \n\n3. [US-Taliban peace agreement collapses within a day](https://time.com/5796592/afghanistan-peace-deal-taliban-attacks/)\n\nAfter the US and the Taliban signed a peace agreement that would lead to the exit of US troops from the country, low-scale fighting immediately resumed. After the Taliban launched an attack on US forces, the US retaliated with a drone strike. However, the deal does not seem to be in jeopardy and its many secret clauses essentially hide the extent to which the US is willing to tolerate violence against its soldiers, leave alone against Afghans. Meanwhile, the Afghan government has refused to release Taliban prisoners, a key clause of the deal. The Taliban does not recognize the Afghan government, although it is supposed to negotiate a final peace deal with it. \n\n# Top 3 stories from the rest of the world\n\n1. [Italy announces China-style mass lockdown amid Coronavirus](https://www.ft.com/content/3ba863e8-e684-328b-abe1-5aae1d6a8f9d)\n\nItaly, which has reported the most cases of COVID-19 in Europe, has taken the extraordinary decision of putting its entire region of Lombardy on lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, which means 16 million people are barred from leaving the region. This is the largest quarantine in the world outside of China. Meanwhile, the US reported hundreds of more cases and some deaths, California has refused to allow a cruise ship to dock after some passengers were found with the virus, the UK reported over 100 new cases, and a hotel that was re-purposed to hold COVID-19 patients in China collapsed, killing many inside. The WHO reports that over 100,000 people worldwide have been infected.\n\n2. [Joe Biden pulls ahead in Democratic primary](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485919-winners-and-losers-from-super-tuesday)\n\nAfter an exhilarating contest on the so-called Super Tuesday, the race for the Democratic party\'s nominee to take on incumbent President Donald Trump narrowed down from over a dozen candidates to essentially two - former VP Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders, who came in with the most delegates, now lags behind Biden by a small margin. But that is expected to expand and several former candidates endorsed Biden, with the party fearing that Bernie would not only lose to Trump, but sink the party entirely in all the other national and state races due in November. \n\n3. [Turkey unleashes refugees on Europe](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/europe/turkey-greece-migrants-open-border-intl/index.html)\n\nTurkey, which is currently invading Syria, allowed tens of thousands of refugees and migrants to use its border to enter Greece, declaring that it had \'reached capacity.\' However, in stark contrast to the last refugee crisis (when Western Europe welcomed them), European leaders reacted sharply and refused to let the migrants enter. Greek border forces have clashed with the migrants, going as far as using tear gas, and Western Europe has largely supported it, and is currently trying to pay Turkey to take the migrants back. Many suspect that the move is aimed at forcing Europe to recognize Turkey\'s planned annexation of northern Syria. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Story of Mata Hari\n\nSpies take on many shapes and forms - some are of the high-flying James Bond variety, and others (like the doctor that helped capture Osama Bin Laden) come from humbler backgrounds. But the world\'s most celebrated spies tend to always be men - with one big exception.  Margaretha Geertruida Zelle, born in the Netherlands in 1876, became a notorious spy for the French during World War I. Her notoriety however, was not for her daring moves as a spy, but for her colourful character. \n\nAt an early age, Margaretha decided that she would user her feminine body as a ticket to a better life. She replied to a newspaper ad for a bride from Rudolf MacLeod, a privileged colonial captain in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), despite being 21 years younger than him. In a few months, she married him and moved to Indonesia, but the marriage was rocky and fell apart in 9 years. She moved to Paris, where a diplomat that she was having an affair with suggested that she become a dancing stage performer. \n\nIn the early 1900s, Orientalism was at a high in Europe. People were enamoured by exotic dances and clothes from the East, even if they were entirely made up and were alien to any actual Eastern civilization. Using Hindu cultural influences she had picked up in Indonesia, Margaretha joined a circus and came up with a "temple dance," assuming the name Mata Hari ("eye of the day" in Bahasa) to entice her audiences. Her promiscuous performances, including riding almost entirely naked on a white horse, made her a big hit. However, as she grew older and her popularity shrunk, she moved on to being a mistress for soldiers, diplomats, and politicians from almost every country in Western Europe. Borders meant nothing to her.\n\nAt the age of 40, she had an affair with a 21-year old ethnic Russian captain Vladimir de Masloff  in the German air force in 1916, the peak of World War I. Her lover was injured in battle, and when she tried to meet him, French authorities insisted that she spy on the Germans for them in exchange for allowing her to travel to the front lines. She agreed, and began a short-lived quest to become a French spy. In early 1917, French military intelligence picked up German messages claiming that Mata Hari was in fact a double agent, spying for Germany. She was arrested and imprisoned, with only her elderly lawyer (and incidentally a former lover) allowed to meet her. In a stunning revelation, she confessed to taking some money from a German officer in exchange for sexual favours, but claimed that she had not spied for Germany. \n\nAfter a lengthy and questionable trial by military tribunal in Paris, Mata Hari was found guilty of espionage. Many see the trial as a Kangaroo court and as a way for authorities to deflect attention from the successes of Germany in the war. In front of the firing squad, surrounded by news reporters from around the world, she removed her blindfold and blew a kiss at the riflemen before being shot dead. Her name became synonymous with female spies that induce secrets from their lovers, although she herself failed spectacularly at the job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from the world caught your attention?'<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'ffin3h'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ffin3h/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_new_malaysian_pm/</li>

I’ve been researching about Germany a lot since the past 10-15 days and today I found out about their ECTS credit system and they require 180 credits for masters which are only available from a 4 year degree ( Engineering ) in India I think and right now I’m doing a 3 year UG course.

But yesterday one of my posts got deleted and I got banned from the other sub. The post was a tweet of a former theWire employee, presently with Al Jazeera calling to slay all Hindus. That inspired me to look a little further. \n\nSo that sub is laced with deaths of Muslims and of stories of their families. But I did two searches that yielded 0 results. One was Dilbar Negi, the other was Ratan Lal. Now those who don't know, I would tell a little detail about the two. Both died few days ago. Ratan Lal was the head constable who succumbed to injuries by a violent Muslim mob on the main riot day. There are video evidences even released by the Police that the Muslim mob outnumbered them and the constable got injured while trying to save the ACP and DCP. Second person - Dilbar Negi. His arms were chopped and he was burnt to death by Muslims. Yesterday a person caller Shahnawaz was arrested by Delhi Police for the murder of Dilbar Negi. Both these incidents have been covered by various media outlets (maybe not the bigoted ones - Eg wire wrote about Dilbar Negi as man died of burn injuries) but many media houses covered these. This sub has posts on both these people. But there are ZERO posts on the other sub about these two.  I would be OK if at least there were posts on these which were downvoted to death. At least people would have come to know about these. But not having a single post on these show the bigotry of the sub. And blatant Hinduphobia. They remain ignorant of the violence by the Muslims. The will to delete everything that doesn't suit their agenda makes sure that that sub  remain a cushy echo chamber which slowly turns it's members into half knowing bigots.. \n\nI don't want to achieve anything with this post. I just want to grab attention of people who support the other sub and try to take moral high ground on every topic. If you call this sub bigoted, your sub is worse than this. \n\nPS i think naming the sub gets the post deleted here so haven't named"<br />Author: 'Slimshady942'  id: 'ff7mph'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ff7mph/the_problem_with_the_other_sub/</li>

O Madhusūdana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nArjuna has addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa as Govinda because Kṛṣṇa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one's own senses—then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna's deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that Kṛṣṇa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that Kṛṣṇa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kṛṣṇa. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord's plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them\n\n**Question 1 : How the difference between the material life and transcendental life has been exemplified in this verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l173qxpupcl41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac0ae913e51d15483fe21e85c327c955a7d927f\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'ff56ix'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ff56ix/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_13235/</li>

I know that boys have fun with each other but I don\'t want him to be in the company of bad boys and ruin his career. His friends don\'t seem to be bad. But I don\'t know their goals and ambitions. My brother has made an instagram account and I saw his DM where he said gaandu, bsdk, chutiya, gaand, lund. I have heard boys talking this so I was not surprised but he must focus on his career in 10th class. Should I tell my parents? I am serious. I checked his account because he is under 18 and I don\'t want him to have unchecked access to internet, but from this I come to know that he uses foul language. He follows NASA, BJP, ISRO and other influential persons on Instagram. He also watches news but plays a lot of games. Academically, he is above average, 100/100 in maths and I think just like any other "bright" student in other subjects.  He is surprisingly religious, sincere faith in God, silent, serious, aggressive, manners like gentleman, talks respectfully with elders, reserved, talks like an intellectual, knows a lot about international affairs, defence, economy and wants to become software engineer. I am really proud of everything about him!\n\nI don\'t want to judge him on the basis of class performance because I have myself seen top students in school fail the fuck out of competitions. Even I did, because I took the test lightly, didn\'t prepare at all due to lack of guidance and my own insincerity. But I wanted to study Law, get government job so my chance was not completely ruined. We might be siblings but completely opposite to each other in terms of focus and goals, but only time will tell that. \n\nI don\'t know what he is doing with his career. He says that he wants to become engineer but he has not started preparing for JEE and now he is in the company of such boys. He says that he will prepare from 11th class because he\'s read the toppers say so on Quora etc. But I tell him that everyone is different. You don\'t recognize your own potential yet and how much hard work would you need. If you start directly from 11th class, I don\'t know if you\'ll be able to give your all and take it seriously. I want to guide him but I am unsure of what to say. He\'s young, innocent and needs guidance and direction. I am scared what if he continues to take things lightly, not be serious about JEE and lose out on his chance?\n\nHis friends might be cool but these things look cool and trendy in school. But college is a tough race. I have seen a lot of cool boys in my own class not making it unfortunately.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 1.31'<br />Body: "***\\*Please write answer to the questions in comments\\****\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**न च श्रेयोSनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे |**\n\n**न काड्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च || ३१ ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nna ca śreyo 'nupaśyāmi\n\nhatvā sva-janam āhave\n\nna kāṅkṣe vijayaṁ kṛṣṇa\n\nna ca rājyaṁ sukhāni ca\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SYNONYMS**\n\nna—nor; ca—also; śreyaḥ—good; anupaśyāmi—do I foresee; hatvā—by killing; svajanam—own kinsmen; āhave—in the fight; na—nor; kānkṣe—do I desire; vijayam—victory; kṛṣṇa—O Kṛṣṇa; na—nor; ca—also; rājyam—kingdom; sukhāni—happiness thereof; ca—also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Kṛṣṇa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nWithout knowing that one's self-interest is in Viṣṇu (or Kṛṣṇa), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. Under delusion, they forget that Kṛṣṇa is also the cause of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a kṣatriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the kṣatriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under Kṛṣṇa's personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a kṣatriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the kṣatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna's sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.\n\n**Question 1 : Why Arjuna did not want to kill his enemies ? What would have been its consequences ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fxj1ebkq5l41.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fee80658d7d47d2fd3503d8385c1e7c5b5c1b5e0\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'feoama'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/feoama/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_131/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Things you should probably do if you truly want to make a difference, and revive Hindu culture and pride.'<br />Body: "Now I'm as pissed at y'all but it's time to walk the talk. There are 3 parts to everything, the first is we have to restore our culture. This comes with restoring temples and SERIOUSLY studying what you need to know. \n\nReclaim temples is excellent : link to donate : https://reclaimtemples.com/fundraisers/ \n\nThere is no need to whitewash anything here, most of these are in Kerala as far as I have seen and they are a result of islamic riots such as Moplah. The focus here is to donate and get these back up. It does not suffice to build brand new temples IF YOU DONT GO. \n\nSo GO to the temples, make a routine out of it, memorize something (like Vishnu sahasranamam or Lalitha Sahasranamam) and BE UNAPOLOGETIC about it all. There is no need to smile to others sheepishly while reciting and praying to God. I chant a bunch of stuff everyday (not loudly) on the bus wearing corporate clothes and I do get a couple of funny looks, fuck them. Make a routine out of it.\n\nSecondly is the legal stuff. There are a lot of lawyers on our side. Y'all have to understand that there are extremely important cases in courts right now. You can donate to this legal cause : http://www.indiccollective.org/support-us/\n\nThere are other ways to support too I guess. \n\nAnyways if there is more, you can add in the comments. \n\nAnd of course here, I want to add : do not engage with idiot leftists. They are completely impotent as of now, they don't have any policy making power, their retarded rants pose no consequence. Laugh them off like the idiots they are and ACCUMULATE. POWER. Don't waste time during your youth. Study well, study really well, get great marks, get top posts, and get credibility. That's the only way you get to change the narrative. Economic might sets narratives. Please understand and create wealth (and learn to keep it).\n\nThirdly, form groups with your friends. Go and clean temples. Help poor hindu kids learn. Just help our community grow by putting actual effort. \n\nThat's it, please add links to other worthy causes to donate to. Donate the cost of a single pizza per month. That's enough."<br />Author: 'hotdentist2'  id: 'feeo28'<br />Score:115<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/feeo28/things_you_should_probably_do_if_you_truly_want/</li>

Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna\'s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear—namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Gāṇḍīva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 1.29, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**   \n\n\n![img](glpzxpu2x0l41)\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Please Prep and stay safe.'<br />Body: 'This is to bring to your kind notice, that this Covid-19, is extremely virulent and spreads as quick as wildfire in any densely populated areas and countries. Just, as I said, in my last post, this is not to fear monger but a gentle reminder for everyone to be ready for any events which may arise in the coming weeks or months.\n\nDelhi, Gurgaon/Gurugram, have been put on a state of heightened alertness, with all public gatherings being cancelled or are being requested to be cancelled by authorities. I really don’t want anyone over here fretting if selective quarantines are announced or If you may voluntarily hunker down on your own. I know, many of you have bought masks, and that’s very good, but even then don’t forget about basic hand hygiene (remember PPE/masks sometimes, gives the person wearing them a false sense of security. For eg, the person not knowing how to open and restore the n95 mask, may very well contaminate himself at his doorstep after a day of good hygiene).\n\n\nA little bit of prepping would also be advisable, it doesn’t have to be of a magnanimous proportion, 3 weeks of rice lentils and veggies with a little pot of condiments is enough (I say 3 weeks, because after that, no matter how bad the scenario, your govt will reach you), just remember EVERYBODY preps ! even you — do you have an extra AA battery at your home right now ? Then you’re a prepper, do you have eggs to last you a week/couple of days? Then you’re a prepper........remember you don’t have to go overboard, just have enough so that, you don’t have to rush yourself to the local grocery, when any such PSAs are made by the government.\nSuch impromptu actions raises panic and anxiety and are absolutely ill advised, should and when, the hour of need arises.\n\n\nFull disclosure, I am not a doomer (like you have seen on many other Coronavirus subs), not even a doomsday prepper (infact I have never prepared for anything before, I still submit my assignments on the last day after pulling an all-nighter for God’s sake :D).... I am a medico, preparing for my post graduate exam, and I wanted to sincerely address this situation as a lot of media houses in our country are either sensitising the info or are simply brushing-it under the rug. \nI really want you to be left with some extra packets of rice and dal, after this blows over and never been having to use it ; maybe even abuse me, I don’t mind ;), stay safe everyone, and take care of the elderly and your parents (more importantly protect them from the misinformation of whatsapp university)\n\nTl,dr - Prep a little now, it will suppress your anxiety (if you have it), it doesn’t hurt you in anyway to have a little bit of extra supplies. Stay safe. This was in no way to inject fear into my fellow brethren, just a word of kind awareness.

Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ: such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battlefield—he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, "Why am I here?" Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of Kṛṣṇa, who is everyone\'s real self-interest. The conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.\n\n**Question 1 : What was the cause of Arjuna\'s bewilderment ?
