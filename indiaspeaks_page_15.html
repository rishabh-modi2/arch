Now call back to Angana\'s testimony at UN working group in the same year...\n\nHowever, nothing happened to Angana, she continues to be leading centres dedicated to India at Berkley, was funded by CIA-linked Ford, her center includes multiple people of reknown as advisors: including Jaffrelot engaged at CIA-front Carnegie endowment, Ford funded Teesta, Soros/European Commission/church funded Mihir Desai, Soros funded Harsh Mander- whose NGO "accidentally" employed wives of top Maoist leaders in the past..you are getting the gist.\n\nAll news articles &amp; sources for these in this post.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/pciolk/ciafront_ford_fdn_funded_professor_at_berkley/\n\nIn 2005, Angana had helped form and worked with the Coalition Against Genocide in the United States to raise public awareness and protest the visit of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to the U.S. as an honored guest.

Eg She is one of the prominent members of radical leftist org Forum of Inquilab Leftists (FOIL) created as “…a clearing-house for radical Indian activists in the United States, Canada and England… [to] help build projects that make [their] radical politics more material. Curious how while US itself bans communism, it allows radical Indian communists to operate from its soil.\n\nFounder members of FOIL are Vijay Prashad &amp; Biju Mathew, a professor at Rider University.\n\nNewsletter of FOIL is named Ghadar, after the overseas Ghadar party which tried to overthrow Brit rule in India.

realtive of mine who in relation is a cousion (moms aunts sons son )\n\nsame age as me \n\nHe completed schooling in 2019 same year as me . scored 87 % in Karnataka board .from an istitute like narayana chaitanya vikas etc \n\nHe didnt score well in jee or state enterance exams  so didnt take admission and  took a drop year .\n\nhe studied in narayana bangalore and didnt score any rank again i mean the rank was in Lakhs \n\nso i advised him to take admission in private college for Btech or BCA\n\nhis dad who was angry on him for wasting his money said "abhi eakdum paisa nahi hai  iss saal nahi hoga " this was in 2020 corona pandemic and his dad has a utensil shop small shop so not much sales \n\nso i told him ok uncle it usually costs 50-80k for admission + sem fees in btech \n\nand this year he gave state enterance exam again west Bengal \n\nas he lives in Jharkhand and WB is nearby and many students do the same . \n\nhe scored some 50k rank in WBJEE so i said ok now sit for counselling .\n\nand i  &amp; a few of my friends filled his form for him . \n\nhe didnt have 5000₹ for seat acceptance and didnt pay the fees until the very last day \n\nwhich i had to tell him because he didnt bother to check the last date for college site visit and document verification . \n\nhe arranged the 5k from somwhere and then i  told him over call that "today is the last day and your not even in the city \n\nhis dad said \n\n"why dont you or someone from your family visits the college and verifies the  documents " \n\nbut he bought a laptop worth 20k a few months back but he said it was for a content writing job for a blog that paid him 4k per month \n\nwhich would take me at least 2-3 hours even by car but if i didnt his 5k amount would have gone in vain so i did that and called the college before hand and they said it was ok . \n\nso i printed his documents and rushed to the college he got admission in ECE and had applied for upgradation i asked the college if there are any seats vacent in CSE they said yes and also asked about the fact that his father earns less than 2 lakh 50k so any discounts for it they said \n\ni also asked them about education loans as he coudnt pay the remaining amount in cash .\n\na prime minister scheme is present but he has to apply it himself and maintain minimum 8 gpa to get Benfits \n\nhe also coudnt travel via bus so made excuses to not visit the college until he gets a train ticket to go to the city \n\nHe went to the college and he then calls me he didnt like it said i dont like this college\n\nand i want to do cse only so  lets wait for 2nd round of results \n\ni said ok and he asked me about almost every college in city and i had to go through each colleges website find the fees&amp; phone number to give to him and then call the colleges as well \n\ni enquired 4-6 colleges wasted quite alot of time . \n\nluckily he got a seat in cse in 2nd round but the college was outside town and so during normal classes he would have to take hostel there .  which he coudnt afford as well \n\n"this is why  i had told him to take admission in the previous college as he would have been able  to live in his aunts home which is near the college " \n\nthis college was willing to give him a tution fee waiver upto 75% of tution fees as his dad didnt earn more than 2 lakh 50k \n\nthey said you need to get a income proof signed by an A1 grade gazzeted officer . from his district  \n\n.\n\nwhich he coudnt understand what it was so i had to talk to the colleges admission officer and get it all cleared out \n\nand then explain it to his dad his dad said "i have a ca document saying i earn 2lakh 80k and would it work " that this wont work but his dad didnt try about it till now \n\n2ndly he didnt even look into the details to get a loan but now that hefound out that to get a loan a stuident needs a bonified certificate claiming that the student is enrolled in a course and that courses fee structure as well \n\nmeaning they had to give one semester fees from their own pocket\n\nso he i guess with a heavy heart told me that he would study BCA \n\nwhich i had told him a year ago \n\nbut even for BCA he needs to give an exam or else he would end up in a college which is not that good nor would it be much cheaper than Btech .\n\nhe has this mentality in his head that as he doesnt have enough money so he wont even try doing the other things \n\nhe also didnt have migration certificate and because he is from karnataka board he coudnt visit the college and the online procedure was not working as well \n\nwhich i told him to mail the board but 3 weeks have passed he has yet to do anything . \n\nhe makes up excuses before doing anything \n\nlike i cant understand kannada so wont be worth it . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin everything he will make an excuse \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhis mom had said he didnt even open the books from narayana institute \n\nhe came home for talking and some other things he says \n\nhe wants to do masters from foreign university \n\ni told him at least get an admission first in India \n\nthen he blabbers about his friend whose dad is rich so he is studying in Europe \n\nMy dad also told him to stop dreaming and just start by taking an admission in any college \n\nas his rank was not very good for government college .\n\nhe goes to his aunts home as thats where he is living for the admission process and all .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyesterday it was Janamstami and he called to say he cant do Btech so i said why he said the college admission officer is saying you need to come before 2nd september and get the admission \n\nafter that his 5k would be wasted and his admission would be done by Management Quota . \n\nand he might not get it in Btech CSE \n\nnow i told this teacher that sir please understand the situation . \n\nhe said his hands are tied and by the least he needs to give 20k rn and rest 30 k by sept end and rest of the fees by 80 k ecluding any scholarship he gets meaning he needs to give 50k inr \n\nafter which he can get loan as well . \n\nafter the call i felt bad so i asked my cousion what happened your dad was going to arrange the funds

      <li>Title::: 'An idea for educational reform - how English should be taught'<br />Body: "Okay, so we all know that out education system is horrendous and needs to change from the inside out. It's a product of colonialism and western industrialisation. Most of it consists of mugging up unnecessary details to throw them up in exams — this is how creativity dies. However, we cannot go back to the ancient days where the gurukul system with minimal writing and verbal transmission of knowledge was the way to learn. I have some ideas for a good way to teach English (as it is my strongest language and one I can imagine teaching/learning techniques in easily) but it may be applicable to other languages/subjects as well.\n\n\t**A. Pass/fail results till 5th Standard**\nI think this can be applied to most, if not all subjects. Let kids be kids! The purpose of a language is to communicate, whether it is talking to your parents, texting, reading literature, or using reddit. Teach kids all the essential grammar stuff, writing styles, etc. But in order to take the pressure off kids, exams results can be classified into pass or fail. If that feels like too much leeway is being given, instead of percentages the grades could be divided by tens. So if you score 24% you get a 2/10 (and fail, I would think), if you score 68%, you get a 6/10, if you score 91% you get 9/10, etc.\n\n\t**B. Stop memorization of the textbook**\nThis one triggers me the most. What is the point of remembering 20 authors' and poets' names, who wrote what, when you're going to forget about it anyway? Instead those texts should be read and discussed. The Q&amp;As shouldn't be copied from the board. Instead, do away with all the dumb ones (eg: Q. How many stages of lives did Shakespeare write about? A. Seven), bring in questions that spark intelligent discussions among students, and then have the them write down one answer (between 2 to n possible answers). And do *not* test them on these texts. \n\nInstead, we know that about 80% of the textbook works are based on a theme, like beauty of nature, lying, sacrifice, animals, etc. In the exam, ask a question based on one of the themes, but that question should be UNRELATED to the texts studied. Of course, students may refer to those or any other texts should they wish to support their argument/answer. But the point is to foster creativity, to encourage deep thought and communicating those thoughts, and all this memorization gets in the way of it.\n\n\t**C. Have a separate reading and writing class**\nOkay this may sound strange to many of you, but teaching how to read and teaching how to write are different skills. In the US, until 8th Standard, reading and writing are separate classes and I feel like India can learn from this. Have a non-graded reading class, where you have to sit and read a novel for an hour, have book discussions, learn to to analyze characters, plot, themes, what makes a good story, fiction, nonfiction, realism, etc. etc. etc. There's so much to learn! Reading classes should be there to help you dive into literature, both classic and contemporary. It should be there so every week you have an hour to read whatever the hell you want at your reading level.\n\nWriting classes would then exist for things like grammar, letter writing, doing the things in the previous point, taking what you learn from reading class and putting it into writing. There can be a days where you learn to compose a haiku, or analyze and discuss a Sonnet. Lots of possibilities! Testing reading comprehension, grammar, and writing skills becomes a lot less mundane this way.\n\n\t**D. Speaking skills**\nThis is greatly overlooked in our schools. Reading and writing are of no use if you can't confidently speak! Instead of forcing students to come up with skits or making one kid read Shakespeare backstage while their friend acts and mouths the words, wouldn't it be so much better just to have speaking exercises? It can again range from debates to rap battles to writing jokes. As for testing, depending on the level, have a few discussion topics and each student can have a 1 on 1 with the teacher/classmate. Grade accordingly.\n\nI have several more ideas. I know these ones are quite rough and all the logistics haven't really been worked out. Also I'm sleepy and not sure why I decided to spend an hour writing all of this down on my phone. But yeah, let me know if these make any sense, what you'd add/change.

      <li>Title::: 'Discussing The Mulakkaram, or How Not To Study History'<br />Body: 'The issue of Mulakkaram &amp; the debate that has surrounded it is a perfect example of how not to study or write history. You could actually predict what the responses are going to be based on what version of story you go with. Depending on the person telling the story, either the whole narrative is 100% correct (including all the colorful details that accompany it) &amp; any counter-argument is an attempt by the Hindutva supremacists to distort history or it is a complete lie that has been created out of thin air by the Marxist historians to discredit Hinduism. Let us begin with the popular version of the story &amp; then try to find an answer to the question.\n\n&gt;*The upper castes king of Kerala (known as Travancore at the time) levied a breast tax on lower caste women for the right to cover the upper parts of their body. This practice continued for centuries until an Ezhava woman called Nangeli cut out her breast in protest over the tax leading to the tax being withdrawn by the King. (There are usual additions to the story, such as the tax collectors measuring the breast sizes of each woman to determine the tax to be paid)*\n\nNow for the ease of understanding, I am dividing your question in 3 parts &amp; answer them one by one\n\n**Did the Mulakkaram exist?**\n\nYes. The Mulakkaram was a poll tax whose beginings could be traced to 1747 when the Travancore kingdom was engulfed in war from all sides. Since Travancore lacked the traditional means of revenue (as land rents were not charged there) the state started taxing people in what could be called innovative ways. For example, there also used to exist a tax which was called refuge tax which was levied based on number of houses present in village &amp; each house owner has to pay the same amount irrespective of the size of the dwelling. Although the nobility were exempt of these taxes a la the ancient regime in France, the King at that time, Martanda Verma became sort of (in)famous for appropriating the wealth &amp; property of the nobles to maintain the large forces under his command.\n\nThe poll tax was levied on every adult i.e. 14yo present in the kingdom, and it was called Thalakkaram (head tax) for the men &amp; Mulakkaram (breast tax) for the women. Although the tax was nominal (atleast according to the officials collecting them) it was very burdensome to the local populace when combined with other taxes. It was abolished in the year 1040 of the Malayalam Era (Around 1864-65 CE) along with 110 other such taxes\n\n\\[Sources :-\n\nTravancore Tribes &amp; Caste (1937) by LA Krishna Iyer\n\nNative life in Travancore (1885) by Rev Samuel Mateer\\]\n\n**Were lower caste women prevented from covering upper parts of their body?**\n\nA lot of foreigners who visited Malabar mentioned the practice of women going around bare breasted with the upper caste women using a Chela or a loose piece of cloth which was loosely flying across the chest (but then again, the Chela was part of formal attire only &amp; even Brahmin women went bare breasted even in weddings)\n\nThe first foreign traveller to Kerala (or Malabar) is **Ibn Batuta** who mentions that\n\n&gt;King of Calicut as his clothing consisted of a great piece of white stuff rolled about him from the navel to the knees, and a little scrap of a turban on his head; his feet were bare, and a young slave carried an umbrella over him.\n\nThe next foreign traveller who mentions this practice is **Marco Polo** who mentions\n\n&gt;You must know that in all this Province of Maabar there is never a Tailor to cut a coat or stitch it, seeing that everybody goes naked! For decency only do they wear a scrap of cloth; and so \'tis with men and women, with rich and poor, aye, and with the King himself, except what I am going to mention.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is a fact that the King goes as bare as the rest, only round his loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round his neck he has a necklace entirely of precious stones,--rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that this collar is of great value\n\nThen in the 18th century **John Grose** in his V**oyage to East Indies** &amp; **James Forbes** in his **Oriental Memoirs** mention that women in Kerala didn\'t cover upper part of their bodies.\n\nSo from the available evidence women not covering their upper bodies seem to be an universal practice in Kerala, so much so that when Raja Ravi Verma painted a portrait of the queen of Travancore the queen posed with a thin strip of cloth barely covering her chest. **LA Krishna Iyer** again mentions in his other work **Cochin Tribes &amp; Castes (page 100)**. {This work contains many pictures of Nambudiri Brahmin women themselves going around topless, including a curious picture of a Nambudri lady &amp; a bride, where the bride is the only one who has covered her upper body}\n\n&gt;The absence of any covering for the bosom in ordinary female dress has drawn much ridicule on the Nayars, and this custom has been much misunderstood by foreigners. So far from indicating immodesty, it is looked upon by the people themselves in exactly the opposite light…”A custom has in it nothing indecent when it is universal,”\n\nThe problem in this case arises from the attempt to apply our modern concepts of modesty to historical practices. How wrong this approach could be is best illustrated by a curious incident mentioned by **C Kesavan,** who was the **first elected chief minister of Travancore**, in his autobiography **Jeevitha Samaram**. He mentions that one of his sister-in-laws procured a blouse &amp; went around wearing it, showing it to ladies of the village only to find her mother standing with a coconut branch to beat her with for "roaming shamelessly wearing shirts like the Muslim women" \\[sic\\]\n\nThese attitudes started changing with the arrival of Xtian missionaries in Kerala, who asked the new converts to cover themselves for the sake of decency leading to the famous cloth struggles of the 19th century. But then again, *one has to remember that the cloth struggle of Travancore was about the right to cover their upper body in the same way as upper caste women, for at no point during the whole struggle was the right of these women to cover their upper bodies was questioned.*\n\n**Does the story of an Ezhava woman hacking off her breast, has any basis in history?**\n\nThis part is the most repeated of the story repeated by everyone who believes the story to be true. Unfortunately, most the references to the story are from the last 10 years and could be attributed to one person, a painter named **Murali T**. whose nom de plume is **Chitrakaran**. Unfortunately, nobody ever bothers to cross check the story. Because according to Murali\'s own admission ***even the supposed kin of Nangeli don\'t know anything about her.*** Think about it, somebody in India being unaware that their ancestors has done something great!!!\n\nSo where this story comes from? The first mention of this story is in 1960 by a bureaucrat named **NR Krishnan** in his work title **Izhavar Annum Innum**. But Krishnan didn\'t mention any sources for the story. The story was picked up by **RN Yesudasan** for his 1980 work titled, **The History of London Missionary Society in Travancore**.  And from there the story has been repeated infinitely as a gospel without any attempt to check the contemporary sources to see if they ever match with the prevalent version of events.\n\nThe closest we come to such a story in contemporary sources is **LA Krishna\'s 1937 work**. On page 165 of this book he mentions anapocryphal tale i.e.\n\n&gt;*Once, when the agent of the Raja went to recover talakaram, the Malayarayan pleaded inability to pay the amount, but the agent insisted on payment. The Arayans were so enraged that they cut off the head of the man and placed it before the Agent saying ‘here is your ‘thalakaram.’ Similarly, inability was pleaded in the case of an Arayan woman from payment of mulakaram, but the Agent again persisted. One breast of the woman was cut off and placed before him saying ‘here is your mulakaram.’ On hearing this incident, the Raja was so enraged at the indiscretion of the agent that he forthwith ordered the discontinuance of this system of receiving payment.*\n\nBut the unfortunate souls mentioned in this incident are Arayans who were outside the ambit of caste &amp; were as disconnected from the wider caste struggle as possible. So we can conclude that the story of Nangeli was an invention by N R Krishanan in an attempt to provide a heroine to the Ezhava community. And from that point on, the whole issue has turned into a giant game of telephone with each successive retelling embellishing it further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr;\n\n**The mulakaram existed but it was a poll tax &amp; had nothing to do with the right to cover one\'s upper body**\n\n**Women in Kerala up until the early 20th century didn\'t put much importance to covering the upper body, regardless of caste, a situation which started changing with the arrival of Xtian missionaries in early 19th century.**\n\n**It is possible that a woman\'s breast was hacked off or a man\'s head was cut down in frustration over the taxes, but there is no way to verify the story.**\n\n**All 3 points mentioned above have no connection to each other (save the fact that they happen in the same geographical area)**'<br />Author: 'Sikander-i-Sani'  id: 'penblo'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/penblo/discussing_the_mulakkaram_or_how_not_to_study/</li>

Especially for projects like [Delhi-Mumbai Expressway having land acquisition of 15,000 hectares](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-2-years-drive-from-delhi-to-mumbai-in-just-12-hours/articleshow/82125118.cms) or even [Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet train project needing 1396 hectares of land acquisition](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/95-of-land-acquired-for-bullet-train-project-in-gujarat-23-done-in-maharashtra-nhsrcl-7182966/).\n\nAlso, China has a much higher millionaire exodus according to this [article](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-places-that-rich-people-are-leaving-china-and-india-top-the-list/articleshow/83533726.cms).

There are those that emigrate or were born in these countries due to  British moving Indian labourers to work during the shitty colonial times. Such as Fiji, Kenya or South Africa. Many choose to stay due to next generations having assimilated.\n\nNow from my observations, not everyone who leaves India is necessarily a brain drain. According to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin), the most are in the U.S. this MIGHT be a brain drain but majority just do simple white collar jobs in America. Then you can see next on the list are UAE, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, which are also considered developing countries. If you consider where the diaspora is, majority are in developing countries. Many of those who go to Arab countries for labour work. Im sure Indians know about the labour camps they have there. These people remit money back to India. [India has the largest remittance in the world with $69 billion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance). Hell, in my experience, majority of the Indians who come here to Australia just do stuff like aged-care jobs or whatever because it pays so damn much for so little work &amp; education. Even labour jobs as well. Then of course there are those in \n\nAlso, it can kind of benefit India in a way of these people leaving. For example, spreading cuisines, people taking interest in Bollywood,  Diwali, Holi and more. Except those that are those NRIs who think  they\'re superior and loathing.

News and discussion do not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories and your thoughts in the comments. Here are a few to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [US strikes ISIS-K with drones to avenge airport attack](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/28/asia/afghanistan-us-airstrike-evacuation-mission-intl/index.html)\n\nIn the continuing saga of US President Joe Biden\'s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US launched a drone strike on a suspected operator for the local ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, ISIS-K (K for Khorasan). This comes on the heels of a terrorist attack outside the US-controlled Kabul airport, which killed over 170 Afghan civilians and 13 American soldiers and that ISIS-K took credit for. Biden vowed to hunt down and make the perpetrators pay. However, despite the blast, desperate Afghans continue to crowd around the airport, hoping to escape the despotic regime of the Taliban. The Taliban has stopped allowing Afghan citizens to leave the country, claiming that they need skilled workers to run the country. The drones flew from a US air base in the UAE.\n\n2. [Justin Trudeau faces furious crowd of protesters](https://www.foxnews.com/world/trudeau-campaign-event-canceled-protesters-coronavirus)\n\nCanada goes into a snap mid-term poll next month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided to dissolve his minority government, in the hopes of acquiring a majority in Parliament on the back of his supposedly good handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, his campaign has been interrupted continuously by protesters who have been furious over the repeated lockdowns and strict vaccination requirements set by the federal government. Canada requires anyone using any means of non-private transportation - air, rail, sea, bus - to be vaccinated, in addition to all federal government employees. Trudeau has also promised to pilot a national vaccine passport system if re-elected. Protesters include those that are anti-vax as well as people who are angry at the state of the economy.\n\n3. [Baghdad conference hopes to stop Iran-Saudi Arabia hostilities](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/baghdad-conference-seen-as-regional-turning-point-677951)\n\nIn a unique initiative, seen by America watchers as a further sign of America\'s departure from the world, the government of Iraq is hosting a conference of all neighbouring Arab countries, major European countries, and potentially also the leaders of Iran and Turkey (Israel is not included). The aim of the conference is to find a way to stop the proxy wars between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which has crippled Iraq since American forces pulled out of the country. Iraq is in a unique position, being a Shia majority and also an Arab majority country, thus a bridge between Shia and Indo-European Iran and Sunni and Arab Saudi Arabia. Rivalry between the two has turned the entire middle east into a proxy warzone.\n\n4. [\'Havana Syndrome\' delays US Vice President\'s flight](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/24/1030663913/kamala-harris-havana-syndrome-vietnam-delay-embassy)\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris was visiting Singapore and Vietnam in the hopes of assuaging concerns that the US would dump those allies like it had dumped Afghanistan. However, her flight to Hanoi was delayed after US embassy staff had to be rushed to a hospital after reporting the so-called Havana Syndrome. This is a mysterious set of symptoms first reported by US diplomatic staff in Cuba in 2016. The Journal of the American Medical Association describes the Havana Syndrome as a form of brain injury, with symptoms including loss of hearing, nausea, and memory loss. These have since been reported by diplomats of other countries, most notably by Chinese diplomatic staff in Washington, DC. The cause is unknown, but it is suspected to be some sort of ultrasonic attack.\n\n5. [Quad begins Malabar Exercise 2021 as China watches](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-nations-to-kick-off-4-day-malabar-naval-war-games-with-eye-on-china/articleshow/85649928.cms)\n\nMembers of the Quad - India, Japan, the US, and Australia - began a 4 day naval exercise off the coast of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. The grouping is widely believed to be a nascent version of an Asian NATO meant to deter China from military expansion in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This is only the second time that all four members of the grouping have come together for the exercise, with Australia having been the most reluctant to anger Beijing. The 2021 exercise is expected to include surface, sub-surface, and air-based drills.\n\n6. [2 die in Japan over tainted vaccines](https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/2-people-die-japan-after-moderna-shots-tainted-batch)\n\nJapan temporarily halted distribution of the Moderna mRNA-based vaccine after a lot was found to be contaminated with an unspecified metallic compound. However, before the suspension, two people in their 30s died after receiving the vaccine due to the contamination. Neither Moderna nor Japan have explained how the contamination happened. It may be noted that the company itself is indemnified from any legal consequences as part of its supply agreement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Operation Leech\n\nA "Chinese wall," in metaphor, refers to a strict boundary between two organizations that separates everything between them - people, files, and information. Most of the time, Chinese walls are erected due to legal requirements. But in the world of intelligence, lubricated by double agents, Chinese walls are a necessity. For when the wall breaks down, things get ugly. Such an event happened right here in India. This is the story of Operation Leech. The full account is sketchy, but this is a rough reconstruction.\n\nBurma (Myanmar) is the neighbour that we never think about, despite sharing a very long border of over 1,600 km with it. It is also the neighbour with the most troubled relationship with democracy: while Pakistan has had its civil-military hybrid governments as well as pure military governments, Myanmar has been a military dictatorship for virtually all of its post-Independence history. This is partly because of the diversity of tribal groups in the country that have demanded autonomy - and picked up arms to fight for it. At any given point of time, Myanmar has more active insurgent groups than all of the Indian subcontinent combined. \n\nBut the origin and funding of many of these groups is murky. While it is true that China has sponsored some of them, a little known fact is that for decades, India\'s external intelligence agency, R&amp;AW, also trained and armed some of them, most prominently the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in Kachin state, which borders Arunachal Pradesh and China\'s Yunnan province. R&amp;AW supported the organization by allowing them to trade in jade through India (since Myanmar was under international sanctions for its jade trade) and also use Indian territory to drop off arms. This arrangement lasted for decades, but eventually soured as the KIA started sharing arms with insurgent groups in the northeast. It was time to teach them a lesson.\n\nR&amp;AW decided to fight one insurgent group with another, propping up the Arakan Army (AA), which operates in Rakhine State (bordering Bangladesh) but competes with the KIA. Part of this arrangement was to allow the rebels to use the Andaman Islands as an arms drop off point from the Thai-Myanmar border, from where they would move them to Cox\'s Bazar in Bangladesh and then to Rakhine state. On Feb 8, 1998, a group of AA soldiers started a journey to Landfall Island in the Andamans, but were unexpectedly stopped by an Indian tri-services team led by Col VS "Gary" Grewal. Believing the tri-services team to be coordinating with R&amp;AW, the insurgents went along with them. However, on 11 Feb, the leaders of the rebel group were taken to a forest and killed. The Army claimed that the rebels were funneling arms to insurgents in the northeast, and 34 rebels were arrested. Their operation was codenamed Operation Leech. Apparently, the Chinese wall between military and civilian intelligence had broken down.\n\nOr did it? While the 34 rebels were kept in secret detention for 11 years without a trial, human rights activists started doing the rounds for them. The story that came out is intriguing. It is alleged that the tri-services team was indeed supposed to work with R&amp;AW to aid the rebels, and defense minister George Fernandes, who supported movements for democracy in Myanmar, had ordered them to cooperate. But it is alleged that Grewal was acting as a double agent for the military regime of Myanmar, busting the entire drop-off and then retiring and moving to Myanmar to get rich off the smuggling of jade. Fernandes ordered a CBI inquiry, but the agency failed to gain access to Grewal because Amy chief Gen VP Malik refused to allow it.\n\nSo was Grewal a double agent? Most likely - but maybe not for Myanmar\'s generals. For it seems that yet another Chinese wall was broken with Operation Leech - that between the MEA and the MoD. In 1995, Myanmar made its first overture to New Delhi, offering to hunt down insurgents in India\'s northeast in exchange for India stopping its support of rebels in that country and normalizing relations with the regime. Operation Leech was perhaps ordered by the MEA and the Cabinet Secretary (under which R&amp;AW operates), bypassing Fernandes entirely because of his pro-rebel stance. \n\nMeanwhile, the CBI could never prove its case that the rebels were actually funneling arms to northeastern insurgents. The case fell through, and all 34 were released in 2011 and resettled in the Netherlands under the auspices of the UN refugee agency. To date, nobody knows exactly why Operation Leech happened, but it is clear from events of this year that New Delhi is much more comfortable with the generals in Myanmar than it was two decades ago. Is that a hint?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

Its almost useless!\nFor some years Im noticing google image search is getting worser. The first time I noticed it when they removed the customized resolution filter which I think was a very important feature. \nAlso another thing I noticed is the image search results you get , most of the times it shows the images with the lower or crapy resolution images (even if you set the high quality resolutiin filter). I remember a few years ago , even if I couldn\'t find the image I am looking for , when I click "search for similar images" it generally gave me the closest images possible or sometimes the exact image I was ooking for, but looks like this feature is also broken now becausd it generally shows the unrelated/ useless images most of the time.  \nThey also removed the "view image" option, which was also a useful thing. \nLooks like I have to switch to yandex image search which is far far better than this shit.  Dont know how but they have all the features which google lacks / removed and most of the time their search results give me exactly what I am looking for.

But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of US power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation. But Google has always been comfortable with this proximity. Long before company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin hired Schmidt in 2001, their initial research upon which Google was based had been partly funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).48 And even as Schmidt’s Google developed an image as the overly friendly giant of global tech, it was building a close relationship with the intelligence community.\n       \n&gt; In 2003 the US National Security Agency (NSA) had already started systematically violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) under its director General Michael Hayden.49 These were the days of the “Total Information Awareness” program.50 Before PRISM was ever dreamed of, under orders from the Bush White House the NSA was already aiming to “collect it all, sniff it all, know it all, process it all, exploit it all.”51 During the same period, Google—whose publicly declared corporate mission is to collect and “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”52—was accepting NSA money to the tune of $2 million to provide the agency with search tools for its rapidly accreting hoard of stolen knowledge.53\n        \n\n&gt;In 2004, after taking over Keyhole, a mapping tech startup cofunded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the CIA, Google developed the technology into Google Maps, an enterprise version of which it has since shopped to the Pentagon and associated federal and state agencies on multimillion-dollar contracts.54 In 2008, Google helped launch an NGA spy satellite, the GeoEye-1, into space. Google shares the photographs from the satellite with the US military and intelligence communities.55 In 2010, NGA awarded Google a $27 million contract for “geospatial visualization services.”56\n       \n&gt; In 2010, after the Chinese government was accused of hacking Google, the company entered into a “formal information-sharing” relationship with the NSA, which was said to allow NSA analysts to “evaluate vulnerabilities” in Google’s hardware and software.57 Although the exact contours of the deal have never been disclosed, the NSA brought in other government agencies to help, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.\n       \n&gt; Around the same time, Google was becoming involved in a program known as the “Enduring Security Framework”58 (ESF), which entailed the sharing of information between Silicon Valley tech companies and Pentagon-affiliated agencies “at network speed.”59 Emails obtained in 2014 under Freedom of Information requests show Schmidt and his fellow Googler Sergey Brin corresponding on first-name terms with NSA chief General Keith Alexander about ESF.60 Reportage on the emails focused on the familiarity in the correspondence: “General Keith . . . so great to see you . . . !” Schmidt wrote. But most reports overlooked a crucial detail. “Your insights as a key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” Alexander wrote to Brin, “are valuable to ensure ESF’s efforts have measurable impact.”\n       \n&gt; The Department of Homeland Security defines the Defense Industrial Base as “the worldwide industrial complex that enables research and development, as well as design, production, delivery, and maintenance of military weapons systems, subsystems, and components or parts, to meet U.S. military requirements [emphasis added].”\n\n &gt;The Defense Industrial Base provides “products and services that are essential to mobilize, deploy, and sustain military operations.” Does it include regular commercial services purchased by the US military? No. The definition specifically excludes the purchase of regular commercial services. Whatever makes Google a “key member of the Defense Industrial Base,” it is not recruitment campaigns pushed out through Google AdWords or soldiers checking their Gmail.\n      \n&gt; In 2012, Google arrived on the list of top-spending Washington, DC, lobbyists—a list typically stalked exclusively by the US Chamber of Commerce, military contractors, and the petrocarbon leviathans.62 Google entered the rankings above military aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, with a total of $18.2 million spent in 2012 to Lockheed’s $15.3 million. Boeing, the military contractor that absorbed McDonnell Douglas in 1997, also came below Google, at $15.6 million spent, as did Northrop Grumman at $17.5 million.\n\n&gt; In Autumn 2013 the Obama administration was trying to drum up support for US airstrikes against Syria. Despite setbacks, the administration continued to press for military action well into September with speeches and public announcements by both President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.63 On September 10, Google lent its front page—the most popular on the internet—to the war effort, inserting a line below the search box reading “Live! Secretary Kerry answers questions on Syria. Today via Hangout at 2pm ET.”\n\n&gt;As the self-described “radical centrist”65 New York Times columnist Tom Friedman wrote in 1999, sometimes it is not enough to leave the global dominance of American tech corporations to something as mercurial as “the free market”:\n \n\n&gt;The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist. McDonald’s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the designer of the F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley’s technologies to flourish is called the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.66\n \n&gt; If anything has changed since those words were written, it is that **Silicon Valley has grown restless with that passive role, aspiring instead to adorn the "hidden fist" like a velvet glove. Writing in 2013, Schmidt and Cohen stated,**\n\n&gt;**What Lockheed Martin was to the twentieth century, technology and cyber-security companies will be to the twenty-first.**67\n\n&gt; This was one of many bold assertions made by Schmidt and Cohen in their book, which was eventually published in April 2013. Gone was the working title, “The Empire of the Mind”, replaced with "The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business". By the time it came out, I had formally sought and received political asylum from the government of Ecuador, and taken refuge in its embassy in London. At that point I had already spent nearly a year in the embassy under police surveillance, blocked from safe passage out of the UK. Online I noticed the press hum excitedly about Schmidt and Cohen’s book, giddily ignoring the explicit digital imperialism of the title and the conspicuous string of pre-publication endorsements from famous warmongers like Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, Bill Hayden and Madeleine Albright on the back.\n\n&gt;  Billed as a visionary forecast of global technological change, the book failed to deliver—failed even to imagine a future, good or bad, substantially different to the present. The book was a simplistic fusion of Fukuyama “end of history” ideology—out of vogue since the 1990s—and faster mobile phones. It was padded out with DC shibboleths, State Department orthodoxies, and fawning grabs from Henry Kissinger. The scholarship was poor—even degenerate. It did not seem to fit the profile of Schmidt, that sharp, quiet man in my living room. But reading on I began to see that the book was not a serious attempt at future history. It was a love song from Google to official Washington. Google, a burgeoning digital superstate, was offering to be Washington’s geopolitical visionary.\n\n &gt;  One way of looking at it is that it’s just business. For an American internet services monopoly to ensure global market dominance it cannot simply keep doing what it is doing, and let politics take care of itself. American strategic and economic hegemony becomes a vital pillar of its market dominance. What’s a megacorp to do? If it wants to straddle the world, it must become part of the original “don’t be evil” empire.\n\n &gt; But part of the resilient image of Google as “more than just a company” comes from the perception that it does not act like a big, bad corporation. Its penchant for luring people into its services trap with gigabytes of “free storage” produces the perception that Google is giving it away for free, acting directly contrary to the corporate profit motive. Google is perceived as an essentially philanthropic enterprise—a magical engine presided over by otherworldly visionaries—for creating a utopian future.68 The company has at times appeared anxious to cultivate this image, pouring funding into “corporate responsibility” initiatives to produce “social change”—exemplified by Google Ideas. But as Google Ideas shows, the company’s “philanthropic” efforts, too, bring it uncomfortably close to the imperial side of US influence. If Blackwater/Xe Services/Academi was running a program like Google Ideas, it would draw intense critical scrutiny.69 But somehow Google gets a free pass.\n\n&gt;Whether it is being just a company or “more than just a company,” Google’s geopolitical aspirations are firmly enmeshed within the foreign-policy agenda of the world’s largest superpower. As Google’s search and internet service monopoly grows, and as it enlarges its industrial surveillance cone to cover the majority of the world’s population, rapidly dominating the mobile phone market and racing to extend internet access in the global south, Google is steadily becoming the internet for many people.70 Its influence on the choices and behavior of the totality of individual human beings translates to real power to influence the course of history.\n\n&gt;#*If the future of the internet is to be Google, that should be of serious concern to people all over the world—in Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, the former Soviet Union, and even in Europe—for whom the internet embodies the promise of an alternative to US cultural, economic, and strategic hegemony.*'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'pdrxk6'<br />Score:76<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pdrxk6/after_investing_rs_34000_crore_in_jiogoogle_to/</li>

And one of the ways it does is in using internal divisions within the country to play political parties against each other. It sees BJP as a threat that has the potential to unify the country unlike Congress.\n\nAnd this exactly is the reason (or one of the reasons) why China choose to close its communications to outside world , especially US in early 2000's.

His videos on YouTube have over 25 Million views and his infographics have been featured in leading news portals like The Hindustan Times, CNN News18 and RepublicWorld.\n\nAshris graduated from IIT Kharagpur studying architecture in 2017 and then did his research on Mixed Reality at MIT Media Lab.\n\n## INDIA IN PIXELS\n\nWe have seen some of Ashris\'s work being shared and generating quite a bit of discussion in our sub-reddit. \n\nExample: [https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p7wil1/what\\_percentage\\_of\\_people\\_in\\_india\\_have\\_parents/](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p7wil1/what_percentage_of_people_in_india_have_parents/)\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words. \n\nIn "IndiaInPixels" case, I think we can all agree that an image that is a innovative form of data visualization , which is backed by solid references to raw data sources, is worth much, much more than a thousand words.  \n\nSuch forms of data-visualizations can actually help kickstart conversations that otherwise may never have happened. It also helps in  dramatically accelerating our  understanding and improving our awareness  about issues in niche/obscure areas that India faces.'<br />Author: 'DabakurThakur'  id: 'pcldpp'<br />Score:69<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pcldpp/ama_with_indiainpixels_ashris_choudhury_on_sunday/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Does India needs to become Developed nation or happiest nation ?'<br />Body: "**These days happiness is considered important than GDP.** \n\n*  Do developed nations like America, Russia and don’t have any problems, does daily crime doesn’t happen in this countries, or does poor people don’t exist in these countries. What’s the point of being called as developed nations when the people of that nation are not living happy life. Do you know that around 70% people in America hate their job.  \n* Country receives developed status in terms of it's economic infrastructure, industries, but not in terms of how joyfully and lovingly people of particular country are living their life. \n* We have been a land of seekers for millennials, our ancestors like patanjali, sapt rishi have invested their life in science of inner well-being which is called yoga. It originated from our land, which has now spread to the whole world. \n* But the sad truth is people of bharat are not utilizing one of the most precious gemstone of Bhartiya sanskriti. For those who live in poverty, it's a different matter for them, as daily their survival is in question.  \n* But those people whose survival is taken care of, who ride a bike or drive in Mercedes or BMW even they are suffering, maybe more than the poor people.  So what's the point of becoming rich when you can't enjoy every moment of your life. \n* Same thing applies to the nation as it's made of people, what's the point of developed nation, when people of that nation are not living joyfully. \n* Yoga is the only and only solution to this. It is the technology for inner well-being. Let's make use of it to make ourselves into wonderful human being, and make our nation bhavya bharat."<br />Author: 'Secret_yogi007'  id: 'pcj2wa'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pcj2wa/does_india_needs_to_become_developed_nation_or/</li>

Eg She is one of the prominent members of **radical leftist org Forum of Inquilab Leftists (FOIL) created as “…a clearing-house for radical Indian activists in the United States, Canada and England… [to] help build projects that make [their] radical politics more material. Curious how while US itself bans communism, it allows radical Indian communists to operate from its soil.**\n\n**Newsletter of FOIL is named Ghadar, after the overseas Ghadar party which tried to overthrow Brit rule in India. They aren\'t even subtle about their "revolution", are they?**\n\nMore on FOIL, here: https://www.ahouseofcards.net/groups/foil/\n\nShe is also associated with Friends of South Asia; Very briefly, described as a combination of FOIL and the Pakistan-American Association,with very apparent sponsorship from the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence, per the Pakistani media [5]. Led by Gera, Ra(h)man, Vinay Lal, Mainland Chinese CIIS graduate student(s) working for Chatterji , and several Pakistanis.\n\n&gt;**Sometime in April-May 2005, FOSA, which had received sponsorship from the Pakistan American Alliance (PAA), took out a public demonstration jointly in San Francisco. One of the “highlights” of that demonstration included a prominent placard that proclaimed “ALLAH WILL DESTROY THE TERRORIST STATE OF INDIA.”**\n\n&gt;**When outrage ensued at this appalling, open call for the destruction of India, FOSA resorted to blatant cover-up by removing all references to PAA from its website. The complete account of FOSA’s chicanery in this connection is available in these documents:**\n\nhttps://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/ideological-merchants-of-the-genocide-against-hindus-in-kashmir-the-symbolism-of-angana-chatterji\n\nhttps://www.ahouseofcards.net/groups/fosa/\n\nBoth FOIL &amp; ISI-linked FOSA alumni were behind the endevaor to erase India in California history books- replacing all references of India with "ancient South Asia" and replaced Hinduism with "Ancient Indian religion". This new edit also included many Hinduphobic propaganda characterising Hinduism as a religion replete with casteism &amp; nothing else.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p7ox44/us_academicians_in_california_erased_india_in/\n\nAgain this endeavor to denigrate Hinduism was led by evangelicals groups like Dalit Freedom Network whose board members explicitly state: “The worship of a hundred million gods will disappear. Idolatry will be cast down. But, what will replace it? There has never been a better soul-winning opportunity than right now in the nation of India”; who worked in collaboration with "South Asian" professors like Witzel.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p6cbsh/so_the_venerated_harvard_linguist_promoter_of_pie/\n\n**Angana herself was also involved in lobbying for these Hinduphobc edits, where she had written a letter under FOSA’s banner to the California State Education Board expressing solidarity with FeTNA. Federation of Tamil Sangams in North America (FeTNA)  is a front of the now-defunct LTTE**\n\n&gt;**What’s interesting is that one fine morning, FeTNA’s ex-director Nachimuthu Socrates found himself in the arms of the FBI.** Here are some excerpts from the US Department of Justice regarding Nachimuthu:\n\n…**NACHIMUTHU SOCRATES, a LTTE supporter in North America, and other defendants attempted and conspired to bribe purported U.S. State Department officials to remove the LTTE from the State Department’s Foreign Terrorist Organization list.** Beginning in 2004 and continuing over a period of several months, the defendants met with a confidential informant (CI-1), who was operating under law enforcement supervision, and two purported State Department officials, identified in the complaint as UC-1 and UC-2, and discussed the financial terms of the bribe, including a $1 million up-front payment.. During some of these meetings,… **SOCRATES also discussed the sale of classified United States intelligence information to the LTTE. The complaint alleges that SOCRATES made interim bribery payments to the CI to give to UC-1.**\n\n**The US government investigation also revealed that Nachimuthu &amp; co were planning to procure surface-to-air missiles to use in their “liberation war” against the Sri Lankan state. Angana Chatterji clearly has some charming associates.**\n\nhttps://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/ideological-merchants-of-the-genocide-against-hindus-in-kashmir-the-symbolism-of-angana-chatterji\n___________________________\n#*Funding by CIA front and her dedicated work against Hindu nationalism*\n\nSome books and magazines by Angana: \n\n&gt;Chatterji\'s publications include research monographs, reports and books. In 2004, she co-edited with Lubna Nazir Chaudhury a special issue of Cultural Dynamics, entitled "Gendered Violence in South Asia: Nation and Community in The Postcolonial Present"[15] **In March 2009, after six and a half years of collaborative and theoretical research, she produced a study on Hindu nationalism entitled Violent Gods: Hindu Nationalism in India\'s Present; Narratives from Orissa, published by Three Essays Collective,[16] which received favourable reviews in popular periodicals,[17][18][19] and has been reviewed by American Ethnologist.[20]**\n\nClearly she has no love lost for Hindus.\n\n&gt;**She has co-contributed to an anthology with Tariq Ali, Arundhati Roy et al., Kashmir: The Case for Freedom (2011) and to South Asian Feminisms (2012), co-edited by Ania Loomba and Ritty A.

Chatterji has received support, including scholarships and research awards, for her work from various institutions, including  Ford Foundation, Wallace Global Foundation, **MacArthur Foundation, SwedForest, Marra Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.**\n\nGlobally acclaimed book on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War" eluciates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.\n\n**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA’s intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‘An unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.’**\n\n**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA’s penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**\n\n**‘Bona fide’ foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‘the best and most plausible kind of funding cover’. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‘particularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income’. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‘a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions’ from the early 1950s.**\n\nMore can be read here:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/\n\nWhile Angana gets funded by Ford, she has written a book on Hindu nationalism in collaboration with a strategist employed by another of the CIA front foundations mentioned above- Carnegie Endowment.\n\nFrom her website:\n\n&gt;In 2019, Chatterji co-edited, with Thomas Blom Hansen and Christophe Jaffrelot, the book Majoritarian State: How Hindu Nationalism is Changing India, in which contributors discussed how Hindu nationalism has influenced Indian government bodies and social sectors since 2014\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/pbck2p/one_name_which_everybody_is_glossing_over_in/\n\n**What more, the tradition of Carnegie supplying CIA directors continues to this day!**\n\nThe chairperson of Carnegie\'s board of trustees is former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker,[6] and the organization\'s interim president is president is Thomas Carothers,[7] who replaced former Endowment president and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J.

Looks like there was no criticism of murder of Swami by missionary-Maoists though**\n\n&gt;**The Indian People\'s Tribunal (IPT), also called the Indian People\'s Tribunal on Environmental and Human Rights or Independent People\'s Tribunal, was a People\'s Tribunal set up by the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) on 5 June 1993.**[1] The IPT is an unofficial body led by retired judges who form a panel that conducts public enquiries into human rights and environmental abuses.

In this, Chatterji worked with Indian People\'s Tribunal on Environment and Human Rights, with Mihir Desai, Retired Chief Justice K.K. Usha of Kerala, Sudhir Pattnaik, Ram Puniyani, Colin Gonsalves and others. \n\nSome of the farce by her as part of this tribunal:\n\n&gt;Activists from the Sangh Parivar disrupted the hearing in Bhubaneswar.[citation needed] In a letter to the National Human Rights Commission of India, Chatterji said threats were faxed from the state office of the Vishva Hindu Parishad. The fax said the tribunal was a group of "leftists, fellow travellers and Hindu baiters". It went on "The inclusion of an NRI[fn 1] well-known for anti-Hindu activities in the US suggests foreign funds from sources bent on destabilising the country".[27] Chatterji alleged that Hindu nationalist activists threatened to rape tribunal members and to parade them naked in the streets.\n\n&gt;The tribunal conducted its investigation for almost twenty months and released its report in October 2006. It describes massive mobilisation of the Sangh Parivar, a Hindutva group, against Muslims and Christians, often justifying their actions on the basis of fabricated threats from the minorities. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had been promoting Hindu supremacy using force and coercion.[25] According to Dr. Chatterji, "Forcible conversions to dominant Hinduism, social and economic boycotts, tonsuring, physical intimidation and violence, arson, and even murder are the weapons that Sangh Parivar cadre wields to intimidate and target disenfranchised groups and religious minorities such as Adivasis, Dalits, Christians, and Muslims". \n\nSome notable people who have served on the tribunals:Siraj Mehfuz Daud, former Bombay HC judge; Mihir Desai, co-founder HRLN; Colin Gonsalves, co-founder HRLN &amp; senior advocate at SC; V.

      <li>Title::: 'A letter to fellow indians.'<br />Body: "To all 'Right'and 'Left' wingers of India, I'm ashamed of the sheer amount of tu quoque and ad hominems going on. It's honestly embarrasing. \n\n\nHeads up: I'm what you'd call a leftist. I dont value tradition much(cause it's wrong most of the times), I am very scientifically progressive,split between socialism and capitalism,pacifist,generally anti theistic,etc. I have tried making the following points as unbiased and sound as possible. If you find any fallacy being commited, do let me know. \n\n\nAnd as a final part of the introduction, please be respectful to others, being hateful and condascending will do nothing but increase hatred and radicalise more people. I think everyone here wants india to be a better country, let's accomplish that with respectful and productive discourse. Also: if you cant handle criticism grow a thicker skin. We need Freedom of speech in India(which sadly no political party respects). \n\n\nNow here are the problems the right has with the left\n\n\n1)Not criticising all religions equally:-Now this point I 100% agree with. Criticism of hinduism is plenty in the left(rightfully so, hinduism has many pseudoscientific practises) but very less criticism of other relgions is found. Even though there are plenty of harmful practices present in abrahamic religions. \n\n\n2)Fascination with Socialism:-Now at this point idk which is a better system. I have researched a lot but all sources ive read are heavily biased. Even though i like the theory of socialism im not quite sure of its applicability. I dont like capitalism much as it has led to overexploitation of resources and people but it definitely has brought innovation and lifted millions out of poverty(india being an excellent example). For this we need more productive discourse which sadly doesnt exist. \n\n\n3)Not criticising 'leftist' parties:- the reason i put it in quotation marks is because the so called leftist parties are actually pretty centrist on economics but are definitely culturally left.(INC,AAP,etc). \n\n\n4)Promotion of Intersectionality in an indian context when muslims in india havent had a past like the blacks have had in the west. \n\n\nNow for the problems the Left has with the right\n\n\n1)Hyper Nationalism:-This is a genuine problem. Hindu nationalism is starting to turn into a single minded ideology. Even slight deviation from the status quo results in you being sent hundreds of ad hominem attacks. Criticisng the Modi government results you being called a 'Khangressi' and an 'Anti national'. \n\n\n2)Whatsapp University:-Guys be honest,there is so much propaganda spread through whatsapp. I have seen so much of misinformation and false pride of our culture/country been shared that it's honestly embarrasing. \n\n\nThese are what I think are the prominent criticisms towards the other side.\n\n\nNow some points i would like to make. \n\n\n1)Whenever\xa0someone makes any spiritual claims i dont bother much, my problem is when blatant pseudoscientific nonsense is spread. 'Water forms different crystals if 'different energies' are given','You shouldnt sleep N-S/S-N cause of the Earth's magnetic field' and so on. Guys this is all BS. \n\n\nThere is an excellent quote by Sam Harris 'Faith,if it gets anything right it gets it right by accident.' Stuff like Astrology,Fire rituals,5 element model,etc are provably pseudoscientific things. \n\n\nFollow the scientific method as it never makes anything unfalsifiable. \n\n\n2)Whenever any claim is made please dont take it at face value. Research on your own by first learning the scientific method and checking the validity of any claim. Preferably refer to Peer reviewed papers. \n\n\nUltinately i would just like to say please be respectful and humble. Follow the evidence and dont try to fit evidwnce in your narrative.\nKnow the logical fallacies you can commit and try your best to not commit them. \n\n\nA request to the Left and Right,please organise more debates with an unbiased moderator. \n\n\nTo the left the best Right winger i have found is Kushal Mehra. He is a Right wing Libertarian and is mostly very respectful towards others\nHe very rarely engages in ad hominems and frequently talks to those with opposite views. You can check him out in the 'Carvaka Podcast' on YouTube \n\n\nTo the right wingers the best 'left'(even though the guys is techniclaly centre left) youtuber is 'Soch'. \n\n\nHope we can start making the indian discourse a productive one."<br />Author: 'AUMOM108'  id: 'pc57dj'<br />Score:56<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pc57dj/a_letter_to_fellow_indians/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Colin Gonsalves,1 of the most powerful litigators in SC,with fmr chief justices as trustees in his NGO,&amp; funded by EU &amp; various foreign churches &amp; Soros is a Maoist terrorism defender:“Naxalism is the natural outcome of globalization..Naxalites see force as only way to defend their right to life"'<br />Body: 'From https://www.ahouseofcards.net/groups/fosa/, a website about "South Asian" activist groups aligned against India in US.\n\n&gt;**In 2002, FOSA organized several India-Pakistan Peace Vigils in an attempt to raise “awareness” about the dangers of a nuclear war between the two countries. The events featured Ashish Chaddha[17]and Shalini Gera,[18] among others. Gera and Chaddha are prominent members of FOIL.[19] Gera is one of the main organizers of CAC, another affiliate of FOIL and FOSA, and wrote an article in Tehelka magazine blasting the efforts of Hindus groups to get a fair portrayal of Hinduism in California textbooks.[20] She is also a spokesperson for CSFH, along with Angana Chatterji, and Ali Mir Raza.[21]**\n\n&gt;**On August 2010, FOSA and Association for India’s Development (AID) invited Harsh Dobhal for a discussion on Human Rights in India.[22] According to the announcement, “Dobhal is the [Managing Editor] of Combat Law (www.combatlaw.org), a bi-monthly journal from India that serves as the voice of lawyers and social activists who form the cutting edge of legal activism in India.”[23] Combat Law is a publication with Maoist leanings and agrees with the philosophy of the violent and terrorist Naxal movement in India. In the 2006 edition, Colin Gonsalves, one the editors and founders of Combat Law, is sympathetic to the Naxalites and states the following: “Today, the Naxalites do, by use of force, what the State legislature and judiciary ought to be doing by taking recourse to the Constitution of India.”[24] Further:**\n\n&gt;**Naxalism then is the natural outcome of the globalization process, which isolates, impoverishes and marginalizes the majority of the working people and pushes them inexorably toward rebellion. The very nature of Capitalism and the imperatives of globalization create militants such as the Naxalites who see force as the only way to defend the right to life.[25]**\n\n&gt;**The Maoists, with the help of Pakistani ISI, have been attempting to establish links with Naxalite groups such as the PWG [People’s War Group] and the MCC [Maoist Communist Centre] by using the Siliguri corridor in West Bengal.[26] Such lethal partnerships are seriously undermining the internal security of India. Gonsalves, in his article, hails the Maoist overthrow of the Nepalese government and suggests that India should learn from Nepal.[27]**\n\n\n#This same Colin Gonsalves gets funded by EU governments &amp; Soros to fight cases for Delhi riots accused, Rohingyas, closure of Singhur plant, etc. Soros funded Harsh Mander was employing wives of Maoists in his NGO. Anil Teltumbde, Bhima Koregaon accused Maoist was made a chair in Soros\' university in Europe. \n\n&gt;**Combat Law addresses the Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda as “Comrade,”[28] a popular Communist salutation. Page 16 of the 2006 edition of Combat Law features an interview with Prachanda, who became the Nepalese Prime Minister in 2008 after leading an underground militant communist movement for more than two decades.  The Maoist “people’s war” had in fact left 13,000 people dead, tens of thousands displaced and much of the Nepal’s infrastructure destroyed.[29]**\n\n&gt;Dobhal is also a top leader of the Independent People’s Tribunal (IPT)[30] and in 2010 published a report titled Report of Independent People’s Tribunal on Human Rights Violations in Kashmir.   According to the report, “[the] tribunal witnessed testimonies from all sections of Kashmiri [emphasis original] society, including victims, their family members, social activists, journalists and academicians.”[31] However, a manner that is routine among members of CAG and their affiliates, the IPT only blasts Indian security forces. **One would expect Dobhal, Gonsalves and others, who are key organizers of the Tribunal and Human Rights Law Network (HRLN),[32] to discuss the security situation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or the situation of Hindus in the Kashmir Valley. However, that is completely absent from their analyses and reports.**\n\n&gt;**The HRLN follows a similar line in exposing the “violent abuses of minorities” by Hindus and the Indian State. For example, in introducing its work on “Secularism and Peace”, HRLN prominently discusses violence against Sikhs, Muslims and Christians, but plainly avoids any mention of violence against Hindus.[33] For HRLN and others, Hindus are never victims of any communal violence in India and hence there is no need to fight for their rights.**\n\n&gt;**Like numerous other NGOs and human rights organizations discussed in this website as well as by Malhotra and Neelakandan (2011), HRLN also receives support from various evangelical and church-based organizations. For example, some of its partners and supporters include Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst (EED), Christian Aid, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, Dan Church Aid, etc. along with several European government agencies.[34] For example, EED, which translates to “Church Development Service” was an organization of Evangelical Protestant Church of Germany and has now merged with “Bread-for-the-World.”[35] Similarly, DanChurchAid is part of the Danish National Evangelical Lutheran Church.[36]**\n\n&gt;In 2008, FOSA organized the South Asian Human Rights Film Festival on the 61st anniversary of Indian and Pakistani Independence.[37] It scheduled a series of film screenings related to “human rights abuse” in South Asia. Not surprisingly, one of the **key speakers was Harsh Mander, who rose to fame following the 2002 Gujarat riots where Hindus and Muslims were killed. However, Mander is solely focused on highlighting the atrocities against Muslims while ignoring the human rights of the 59 Hindus, including women and children, who were burnt alive by a Muslim mob. FOSA, CAG and others like Mander easily dismiss these Hindus, including children, as “fascists” and therefore seem to imply that their lives are not important somehow in comparison to those of Muslim men, women and children.** One begs to ask how little children turn into fascists automatically and can thus be sidelined. Krishen Kak, a retired Indian Administrative Services officer, filed a complaint against Mander in 2003 with the Press Council of India for Mander’s highly irresponsible and rumor-filled article Hindustan Hamara (The Times of India, March 2002). The Council’s Inquiry Committee, noted:\n\n**The article at several points reiterated rumours (sic) [emphasis added] that were being circulated at the relevant time. The truthfulness of the facts mentioned therein had not been established at any point of time [emphasis added] till then but Shri Mander had chosen to base his views and sentiments on them, and put pen to the opinion thus formed by him…it was expected of the author as a responsible serving officer as well as of the respondent paper of repute like The Times of India to be more restrained and circumspect in pronouncing a denouncement of the whole system in a communally surcharged atmosphere.[38]**\n\n**Thus, Mander’s penchant for pumping up facts was acknowledged by an independent body.  Sadly, major media outlets like The Times of India carried Mander’s article without regard to journalistic objectivity.**\n\nMander also enjoys support from some of the evangelical and Christian organizations mentioned above. This is further discussed under SAPAC here.\n\n&gt;In 2007, **FOSA, Pakistanis at Stanford, the Center for South Asia (Stanford), and Sanskriti co-sponsored an event called The Kashmir Issue 60 Years Later: Rethinking the Kashmir Conflict A conversation with Beena Sarwar and Huma Dar.[39] Sarwar is a famous Pakistani journalist while Dar is a PhD candidate in South Asian Studies at UC-Berkeley.[40] Even as the Pakistani perspective was clearly represented, no mainstream or campus Indian organization was invited to represent the Indian side of the story. In 2008, Dar, along with Angana Chatterji and others, wrote to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, highlighting the “Humanitarian Crisis in Jammu and Kashmir” and blasted the Indian government for alleged human rights violations. The letter’s pro-Kashmir independence stance is highlighted when Chatterji, Dar and others cover up Kashmir terrorism as a “pro-independence struggle in Kashmir”[41] while deeming Indian counterinsurgency operations as “grave abuses of human rights with social, economic, psychological, political, and environmental consequences.”[42]  Signatories to the letter include Amitava Kumar, a key member of FOIL,[43] Sunaina Maira, another key FOIL member who used to coordinate youth activities of FOIL,[44] Snehal Singhavi and many others.**\n\n&gt;Singhavi was exposed in a 2002 interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for setting a biased agenda for his course called The Politics and Poetry of Palestinian Resistance. The course description stated that it “takes as its starting point the right of Palestinians to fight for their own self-determination. Conservative thinkers are encouraged to seek other sections.”[45] The course thus discouraged diverse opinions on the Palestinian conflict. In calling out Singhavi, Matthews mentions that “[in] a public university, [Singhavi is] accepting students on the basis of their political point of view and rejecting others.”[46] “Civil rights and free speech advocates reacted strongly, calling [Singhavi’s] statements ‘chilling’, and saying that such restrictions do not belong in a university, especially one supported by public funds.”[47]\n\n&gt;FOSA also organized a panel discussion titled SELF DETERMINATION IN SOUTH ASIA: South Asia’s Struggle against US-led Imperialism featuring Vijay Prashad, Angana Chatterji, Abdul Nayyar, and Snehal Shinghavi.[48] The political and ideological agenda of this meeting is palpably clear not only from the lineup of speakers but also by the discussion’s focus. According to the event announcement, the panelists were to discuss:\n\n**The people’s struggle against pro-imperialist Indian elites; the implications of the latest nuclear arms trade agreement between India and the US on the people of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the rest of South Asia, especially women; the role of South Asia in US imperialist ambitions; the other opportunities this presents to build Indian communism and fight the agenda of the global ruling class.[49]**\n\n&gt;**Thus, Indians are labeled as pro-imperialists serving their US masters and endangering the entire South Asian region while Kashmiri, Maoist and Naxal terrorist activities are labeled as “the people’s struggles”. Similarly, the event is also pushing the idea that Communism is probably the best solution to save South Asian people from the “imperialist oppression” of India and US.**\n\n&gt;In 2011, IAMC organized a multi-city tour of Harsh Dobhal of Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), discussed in Chapter 9, for various lectures and discussions on Muslims and the Criminal Justice System in India.[56] \n\nIndian American Muslim Council- IAMC (established by Shaik Ubaid) previously hosted Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), a banned terrorist organization in India which carried out several bombings and seeks to create an Islamic state in India. Founder Shaik Ubaid held leadership position in ICNA- the US front of Jamaat-E-Islami; the terrorist organisation responsible for massacre of lakhs of Hindus in Bangladesh during 71 war.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mvuu3d/founder_of_terror_org_simimohammad_ahmadullah/\n\nhttps://www.hinduamerican.org/wpcontent/uploads/2020/05/Coalition_Against_Genocide_A_Nexus_of_HinduphobiaUnveiled.pdf\n\n&gt;In 2005, Mukul Sinha (father of AltNews\' Pratik Sinha)- speaker at terror linked IAMC was awarded the “Human Rights Lawyer of the Year” by Combat Law, magazine edited by COlin Gonsalves. Sinha’s communist leanings are clear as he advocates “the urgent need for mass struggles against American imperialism”[125] in India. Sinha lashes out against the hardworking Patel community of Gujarat and the Patel NRI communities of the US and UK and accuses the entire community of participating in and financing genocides on Muslims. \n\nColin Gonsalves\'s organisation HRLN:\n\nColin Gonsalves is a mega lawyer in Delhi, runs the HRLN (Human Rights Law Network) which is a division of SLIC (Socio-Legal Information Centre). HRLN fights cases like:\n\ngranting asylum to Rohingyas in India: https://hrln.org/petition-on-rohingyas-refugees-jaffar-ullah-and-anr-versus-union-of-india-ors/ (missing article)\n\ngetting illegal alien Rohingyas released from Indian jail: https://hrln.org/petition-for-release-of-rohingya-refugees-illegally-detained-in-jails/\n\ngetting Bullock Cart racing banned across India: https://hrln.org/litigation/in-a-landmark-judgement-the-supreme-court-imposes-a-complete-ban-on-the-bullock-cart-races-in-the-country\n\nrescue Harsh Mander from Hate Speech (leading to Anti Hindu Riots 2019): \n\ndefending Naxal supporters: https://hrln.org/arrested-over-alleged-naxal-links-bastar-based-journalist-allowed-bail-after-a-year-in-jail/\n\ndefending Modi assassination-accused &amp; those promoting caste based riots &amp; inciting dalits to "revolt" against India : https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/whatsapp-hacking-bhima-koregaon-lawyers-targeted_in_5dba8e9ae4b066da552c5028\n\n\nAlso involved in campaign against ISKCON’s Akshaya Patra, a campaign against Indian sedition laws, and it has been providing free legal aid to Rohingya Muslims in India. It has also been engaging in activism for the implementation of the RTE Act that works against Hindu-run institutions. Against Tata in Singrur case. Furthermore, it is also linked to a plethora of organizations across the country that seeks to undermine India’s territorial integrity.\n\n\n&gt;One of the organizations that strongly advocates the repeal of sedition laws is the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), which is a division of the Socio-Legal Information Centre (SLIC). We have reported earlier that the HRLN is part of a campaign to abolish sedition laws along with PUCL, PUDR, APDR, CPDR, APCLC, which are coordinating organizations of CDRO. The June 2012 bulletin of CDRO also reports that a resolution was adopted against ‘Sedition and other repressive laws’ to which the HRLN was a signatory. The HRLN also used reports by organizations associated with the CDRO to further the notion that “The spectre of communalism in UP is overwhelming and we will need to band together if we are to have any effect in the state.” In the first part of the series, we have explored extensively the links of CDRO to Naxalites.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2018/09/demystifying-the-civil-society-an-incestuous-nexus/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/ol2r2f/what_do_breakingindia_ngos_do_when_central_govt/\n\n**So the same dude is defending Maoist violence is also fighting to decriminalise sedition &amp; our SC is taking it up as a valid cause.

In calling out Singhavi, Matthews mentions that “[in] a public university, [Singhavi is] accepting students on the basis of their political point of view and rejecting others.”[46] “Civil rights and free speech advocates reacted strongly, calling [Singhavi’s] statements ‘chilling’, and saying that such restrictions do not belong in a university, especially one supported by public funds.”[47]\n\nFOSA also organized a panel discussion titled SELF DETERMINATION IN SOUTH ASIA: South Asia’s Struggle against US-led Imperialism featuring Vijay Prashad, Angana Chatterji, Abdul Nayyar, and Snehal Shinghavi.[48] The political and ideological agenda of this meeting is palpably clear not only from the lineup of speakers but also by the discussion’s focus. According to the event announcement, the panelists were to discuss:\n\n**The people’s struggle against pro-imperialist Indian elites; the implications of the latest nuclear arms trade agreement between India and the US on the people of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the rest of South Asia, especially women; the role of South Asia in US imperialist ambitions; the other opportunities this presents to build Indian communism and fight the agenda of the global ruling class.[49]**\n\n**Thus, Indians are labeled as pro-imperialists serving their US masters and endangering the entire South Asian region while Kashmiri, Maoist and Naxal terrorist activities are labeled as “the people’s struggles”. Similarly, the event is also pushing the idea that Communism is probably the best solution to save South Asian people from the “imperialist oppression” of India and US.**\n\n&gt;In 2011, IAMC organized a multi-city tour of Harsh Dobhal of Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), discussed in Chapter 9, for various lectures and discussions on Muslims and the Criminal Justice System in India.[56] \n\nIndian American Muslim Council- IAMC (established by Shaik Ubaid) previously hosted Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), a banned terrorist organization in India which carried out several bombings and seeks to create an Islamic state in India. Founder Shaik Ubaid held leadership position in ICNA- the US front of Jamaat-E-Islami; the terrorist organisation responsible for massacre of lakhs of Hindus in Bangladesh during 71 war.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/mvuu3d/founder_of_terror_org_simimohammad_ahmadullah/\n\nhttps://www.hinduamerican.org/wpcontent/uploads/2020/05/Coalition_Against_Genocide_A_Nexus_of_HinduphobiaUnveiled.pdf\n\n&gt;In 2005, Mukul Sinha (father of AltNews\' Pratik Sinha)- speaker at terror linked IAMC was awarded the “Human Rights Lawyer of the Year” by Combat Law, magazine edited by COlin Gonsalves. Sinha’s communist leanings are clear as he advocates “the urgent need for mass struggles against American imperialism”[125] in India. Sinha lashes out against the hardworking Patel community of Gujarat and the Patel NRI communities of the US and UK and accuses the entire community of participating in and financing genocides on Muslims. \n\nColin Gonsalves\'s organisation HRLN:\n\nColin Gonsalves is a mega lawyer in Delhi, runs the HRLN (Human Rights Law Network) which is a division of SLIC (Socio-Legal Information Centre).

It has also been engaging in activism for the implementation of the RTE Act that works against Hindu-run institutions. Against Tata in Singrur case. Furthermore, it is also linked to a plethora of organizations across the country that seeks to undermine India’s territorial integrity.\n\n\n&gt;One of the organizations that strongly advocates the repeal of sedition laws is the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN), which is a division of the Socio-Legal Information Centre (SLIC). We have reported earlier that the HRLN is part of a campaign to abolish sedition laws along with PUCL, PUDR, APDR, CPDR, APCLC, which are coordinating organizations of CDRO. The June 2012 bulletin of CDRO also reports that a resolution was adopted against ‘Sedition and other repressive laws’ to which the HRLN was a signatory. The HRLN also used reports by organizations associated with the CDRO to further the notion that “The spectre of communalism in UP is overwhelming and we will need to band together if we are to have any effect in the state.” In the first part of the series, we have explored extensively the links of CDRO to Naxalites.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2018/09/demystifying-the-civil-society-an-incestuous-nexus/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/ol2r2f/what_do_breakingindia_ngos_do_when_central_govt/\n\n**So the same dude is funding Naxals and also campaigning for end of sedition law &amp; our SC is taking it up as a valid cause.

And his inclusion is the most ominous portent for India &amp; Hindus.'<br />Body: 'We expect Islamists like Saudi funded institutes to be against Hindutva, we expect communists like Kavita Krishnan to be against Hindus, we expect evangelicals to be against Hinduism &amp; Hindus. \n\nChristophe Jaffrelot is none of the above. His bio from wikipedia.\n\n&gt;Jaffrelot works at the Centre for Studies in International Relations (CERI)-Sciences Po and has served as its Director from 2000 to 2008.[3] He is currently a senior research fellow at CNRS and a professor at Sciences Po. He is also a visiting professor at the India Institute, King\'s College London, and has taught at Columbia University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, the Université de Montréal, and as a Global Scholar at Princeton University.[2] Since 2008, he has been a non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n&gt;Jaffrelot was awarded the CNRS Bronze Medal in 1993, has served as editor or editor-in-chief of several scholarly journals on politics and sociology, and is a Permanent Consultant at the Direction de la Prospective of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.[4] He also chairs the Scientific council of the six research centers of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and CNRS in Asia since 2007. Jaffrelot is the president of the Political Science section of the French National Committee for Scientific Research (CoNRS) since 2012.\n\nPretty influential man, pretty big roles. But **his most interesting role for me is his being fellow at Carnegie Endowment. Same Carnegie Endowment which has been listed by the most authorattive book on Cold War as one of the big CIA fronts (evidenced by constant exchange of positions by officials between the 2 organisations)**\n\n*Globally acclaimed book on ColdWar "Cultural Cold War" elucidates how from the era of 1930s, how US came to be a nation whose policies, particularly foreign policies, were determined by the plutocrats, for the plutocrats. And the means of determination would come to be the plutocratic &amp; corporate funds featuring swivelling doors with CIA with CIA donating its officials for these megafunds and the megafunds donating money and a respectable, non-hostile channel for achieving CIA\'s foreign policy objectives.*\n\n&gt;**In the early 20th century, the United States legalized endowed foundations. They were the new lifeguards of Imperialism, or call it Capitalism, under threat from Communism. Among the first to be set up was Carnegie Corporation, endowed in 1911 by profits from Carnegie Steel Company. The Rockefeller Foundation was endowed in 1914 by JD Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Company.**\n\n&gt;**The use of philanthropic foundations was the most convenient way to pass large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. By the mid 1950s, the CIA’s intrusion into the foundation field was massive. Although figures are not available for this period, the general counsel of a 1952 Congress committee appointed to investigate US foundations concluded that ‘An unparalleled amount of power is concentrated increasingly in the hands of an interlocking and self-perpetuating group. Unlike the power of corporate management, it is unchecked by stockholders; unlike the power of government, it is unchecked by the people; unlike the power of the churches, it is unchecked by any firmly established canons of value.’**\n\n&gt;**In 1976, a Select Committee appointed to investigate US intelligence activities reported on the CIA’s penetration of the foundation field by the mid-1960s: during 1963-6, of the 700 grants over $10,000 given by 164 foundations, at least 108 involved partial or complete CIA funding. More importantly, CIA funding was involved in nearly half the grants made by these 164 foundations in the field of international activities during the same period.**\n\n&gt;**‘Bona fide’ foundations such as Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie were considered ‘the best and most plausible kind of funding cover’. A CIA study of 1966 argued that this technique was ‘particularly effective for democratically run membership organizations, which need to assure their own unwitting members and collaborators, as well as their hostile critics, that they have genuine, respectable, private sources of income’. Certainly, it allowed the CIA to fund ‘a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses, and other private institutions’ from the early 1950s.**\n\n&gt;‘There was a cover branch at CIA whose job it was to help provide cover, like the foundations we used for our operations,’ Braden explained. ‘I paid no attention to the details. The Finance Department would handle it, and talk to the cover officer. It was just a mechanism which you used. The Farfield Foundation was one of them. I don’t know the names of all of them, I can’t remember. But it was a criss-cross of money. There was never any danger of the CIA running out of money.’\n\nMore can be read here:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/op8nmj/antimodi_article_in_mit_fechnology_review_by/\n\n**What more, the tradition of Carnegie supplying CIA directors continues to this day!**\n\n&gt;The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP) is a nonpartisan (lol) international affairs think tank with centers in Washington D.C., Moscow, Beirut, Beijing, Brussels, and New Delhi.[1] Founded in 1910 by Andrew Carnegie, the organization describes itself as being dedicated to advancing cooperation between nations and promoting active international engagement by the United States.\n\n&gt;In the University of Pennsylvania\'s "2019 Global Go To Think Tanks Report", Carnegie was ranked the #1 top think tank in the world.[3] In the 2015 Global Go To Think Tanks Report, Carnegie was ranked the third most influential think tank in the world, after the Brookings Institution and Chatham House.[4] It was ranked as the top Independent Think Tank in 2018.[5]\n\n&gt;#*The chairperson of Carnegie\'s board of trustees is former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker,[6] and the organization\'s interim president is president is Thomas Carothers,[7] who replaced former Endowment president and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns[8] after Burns\' nomination[9] and confirmation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[10]*\n\nChistophe Jaffrelot has also just published a book on Hindu nationalism, so his attack on Hinduism &amp; nationalism- the 2 glues binding India is not fleeting, it is persistent.\n\n**Somebody working at CIA front promoting demonisation of Hindus isnt unexpected, given Truschke herself is being funded by cold war linked federal agencies to write book on Indian history.** And so many universities suddenly uniting in demonisation of a people who would be considered as having native rights, minorities in global politics &amp; more importantly who are facing &amp; have faced genocides having right to protect themselves in "woke" climate.

The events featured Ashish Chaddha[17]and Shalini Gera,[18] among others. Gera and Chaddha are prominent members of FOIL.[19] Gera is one of the main organizers of CAC, another affiliate of FOIL and FOSA, and wrote an article in Tehelka magazine blasting the efforts of Hindus groups to get a fair portrayal of Hinduism in California textbooks.[20] She is also a spokesperson for CSFH, along with Angana Chatterji, and Ali Mir Raza.[21]**\n\n**On August 2010, FOSA and Association for India’s Development (AID) invited Harsh Dobhal for a discussion on Human Rights in India.[22] According to the announcement, “Dobhal is the [Managing Editor] of Combat Law (www.combatlaw.org), a bi-monthly journal from India that serves as the voice of lawyers and social activists who form the cutting edge of legal activism in India.”[23] Combat Law is a publication with Maoist leanings and agrees with the philosophy of the violent and terrorist Naxal movement in India. In the 2006 edition, Colin Gonsalves, one the editors and founders of Combat Law, is sympathetic to the Naxalites and states the following: “Today, the Naxalites do, by use of force, what the State legislature and judiciary ought to be doing by taking recourse to the Constitution of India.”[24] Further:**\n\n**Naxalism then is the natural outcome of the globalization process, which isolates, impoverishes and marginalizes the majority of the working people and pushes them inexorably toward rebellion. The very nature of Capitalism and the imperatives of globalization create militants such as the Naxalites who see force as the only way to defend the right to life.[25]**\n\n**The Maoists, with the help of Pakistani ISI, have been attempting to establish links with Naxalite groups such as the PWG [People’s War Group] and the MCC [Maoist Communist Centre] by using the Siliguri corridor in West Bengal.[26] Such lethal partnerships are seriously undermining the internal security of India. Gonsalves, in his article, hails the Maoist overthrow of the Nepalese government and suggests that India should learn from Nepal.[27]**\n\n\n#This same Colin Gonsalves gets funded by EU governments &amp; Soros to fight cases for Delhi riots accused, Rohingyas, closure of Singhur plant, etc. Soros funded Harsh Mander was employing wives of Maoists in his NGO. Anil Teltumbde, Bhima Koregaon accused Maoist was made a chair in Soros' university in Europe. \n\n**Combat Law addresses the Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda as “Comrade,”[28] a popular Communist salutation. Page 16 of the 2006 edition of Combat Law features an interview with Prachanda, who became the Nepalese Prime Minister in 2008 after leading an underground militant communist movement for more than two decades.  The Maoist “people’s war” had in fact left 13,000 people dead, tens of thousands displaced and much of the Nepal’s infrastructure destroyed.[29]**\n\nDobhal is also a top leader of the Independent People’s Tribunal (IPT)[30] and in 2010 published a report titled Report of Independent People’s Tribunal on Human Rights Violations in Kashmir.  The report blasted the Indian government for “ongoing human rights violations” against people of Jammu and Kashmir. According to the report, “[the] tribunal witnessed testimonies from all sections of Kashmiri [emphasis original] society, including victims, their family members, social activists, journalists and academicians.”[31] However, a manner that is routine among members of CAG and their affiliates, the IPT only blasts Indian security forces. **One would expect Dobhal, Gonsalves and others, who are key organizers of the Tribunal and Human Rights Law Network (HRLN),[32] to discuss the security situation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or the situation of Hindus in the Kashmir Valley. However, that is completely absent from their analyses and reports.**\n\n**The HRLN follows a similar line in exposing the “violent abuses of minorities” by Hindus and the Indian State. For example, in introducing its work on “Secularism and Peace”, HRLN prominently discusses violence against Sikhs, Muslims and Christians, but plainly avoids any mention of violence against Hindus.[33] For HRLN and others, Hindus are never victims of any communal violence in India and hence there is no need to fight for their rights.**\n\n**Like numerous other NGOs and human rights organizations discussed in this website as well as by Malhotra and Neelakandan (2011), HRLN also receives support from various evangelical and church-based organizations. For example, some of its partners and supporters include Evangelischer Entwicklungsdienst (EED), Christian Aid, Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action, Dan Church Aid, etc. along with several European government agencies.[34] For example, EED, which translates to “Church Development Service” was an organization of Evangelical Protestant Church of Germany and has now merged with “Bread-for-the-World.”[35] Similarly, DanChurchAid is part of the Danish National Evangelical Lutheran Church.[36]**\n\nIn 2008, FOSA organized the South Asian Human Rights Film Festival on the 61st anniversary of Indian and Pakistani Independence.[37] It scheduled a series of film screenings related to “human rights abuse” in South Asia. Not surprisingly, one of the **key speakers was Harsh Mander, who rose to fame following the 2002 Gujarat riots where Hindus and Muslims were killed. However, Mander is solely focused on highlighting the atrocities against Muslims while ignoring the human rights of the 59 Hindus, including women and children, who were burnt alive by a Muslim mob. FOSA, CAG and others like Mander easily dismiss these Hindus, including children, as “fascists” and therefore seem to imply that their lives are not important somehow in comparison to those of Muslim men, women and children.** One begs to ask how little children turn into fascists automatically and can thus be sidelined. Krishen Kak, a retired Indian Administrative Services officer, filed a complaint against Mander in 2003 with the Press Council of India for Mander’s highly irresponsible and rumor-filled article Hindustan Hamara (The Times of India, March 2002). The Council’s Inquiry Committee, noted:\n\n**The article at several points reiterated rumours (sic) [emphasis added] that were being circulated at the relevant time. The truthfulness of the facts mentioned therein had not been established at any point of time [emphasis added] till then but Shri Mander had chosen to base his views and sentiments on them, and put pen to the opinion thus formed by him…it was expected of the author as a responsible serving officer as well as of the respondent paper of repute like The Times of India to be more restrained and circumspect in pronouncing a denouncement of the whole system in a communally surcharged atmosphere.[38]**\n\n**Thus, Mander’s penchant for pumping up facts was acknowledged by an independent body.  Sadly, major media outlets like The Times of India carried Mander’s article without regard to journalistic objectivity.**\n\nMander also enjoys support from some of the evangelical and Christian organizations mentioned above. This is further discussed under SAPAC here.\n\nIn 2007, **FOSA, Pakistanis at Stanford, the Center for South Asia (Stanford), and Sanskriti co-sponsored an event called The Kashmir Issue 60 Years Later: Rethinking the Kashmir Conflict A conversation with Beena Sarwar and Huma Dar.[39] Sarwar is a famous Pakistani journalist while Dar is a PhD candidate in South Asian Studies at UC-Berkeley.[40] Even as the Pakistani perspective was clearly represented, no mainstream or campus Indian organization was invited to represent the Indian side of the story. In 2008, Dar, along with Angana Chatterji and others, wrote to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, highlighting the “Humanitarian Crisis in Jammu and Kashmir” and blasted the Indian government for alleged human rights violations. The letter’s pro-Kashmir independence stance is highlighted when Chatterji, Dar and others cover up Kashmir terrorism as a “pro-independence struggle in Kashmir”[41] while deeming Indian counterinsurgency operations as “grave abuses of human rights with social, economic, psychological, political, and environmental consequences.”[42]  Signatories to the letter include Amitava Kumar, a key member of FOIL,[43] Sunaina Maira, another key FOIL member who used to coordinate youth activities of FOIL,[44] Snehal Singhavi and many others.**\n\nSinghavi was exposed in a 2002 interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for setting a biased agenda for his course called The Politics and Poetry of Palestinian Resistance. The course description stated that it “takes as its starting point the right of Palestinians to fight for their own self-determination. Conservative thinkers are encouraged to seek other sections.”[45] The course thus discouraged diverse opinions on the Palestinian conflict. In calling out Singhavi, Matthews mentions that “[in] a public university, [Singhavi is] accepting students on the basis of their political point of view and rejecting others.”[46] “Civil rights and free speech advocates reacted strongly, calling [Singhavi’s] statements ‘chilling’, and saying that such restrictions do not belong in a university, especially one supported by public funds.”[47]\n\nFOSA also organized a panel discussion titled SELF DETERMINATION IN SOUTH ASIA: South Asia’s Struggle against US-led Imperialism featuring Vijay Prashad, Angana Chatterji, Abdul Nayyar, and Snehal Shinghavi.[48] The political and ideological agenda of this meeting is palpably clear not only from the lineup of speakers but also by the discussion’s focus. According to the event announcement, the panelists were to discuss:\n\n**The people’s struggle against pro-imperialist Indian elites; the implications of the latest nuclear arms trade agreement between India and the US on the people of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the rest of South Asia, especially women; the role of South Asia in US imperialist ambitions; the other opportunities this presents to build Indian communism and fight the agenda of the global ruling class.[49]**\n\n**Thus, Indians are labeled as pro-imperialists serving their US masters and endangering the entire South Asian region while Kashmiri, Maoist and Naxal terrorist activities are labeled as “the people’s struggles”.

My daughter studies at the Isha Home School which is in Sadhguru's Ashram since 3rd class. Now she is in final year at the school (but doing online classes currently).\n\nShe has made a wonderful 3 min video about the Pakistani Hindu Camp that is located in North Delhi. This has been selected as one of the best videos for the Connecther Film Competition, which is an international competition.. Currently, we are looking for people who can vote for this video. The more votes the video gets, the better her chances of getting awards for the video. This will really help her career and encourage her to do more projects like this. We also want to help the Pakistani Hindu refugees in the camp because they really need our help.\n\nSO HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO:\n\nGo see the 3 min video called Khilna and vote for it (Click the black Heart symbol on the bottom - see image below).

I have written below more about them (100% of donations will go directly to help them!

She was looking to make a video on girls education for an international film competition. She had never made a video before. I suggested to her lets go visit this Pakistani Hindu camp in North Delhi. She liked the idea. I told her we had to be careful about Covid and keep our distance.\n\nWe found them to be very good and friendly people. Luckily no one had suffered from Covid. There are 800 adults and 300 kids in the camp. I had asked them how come they moved to India, just for Hinduism? Why not just convert to Islam and continue living there in their homes? And they would be treated better. After all, that was their home for centuries? They said they would never convert. Hinduism is everything for them. That is their life, or who they are. That touched me very deeply.\n\nHere are a few of the problems they are facing in the camp.\n\nIt's way too hot and they have no electricity or lights. Sometimes it gets too hot so the kids go out on the road so they can get some wind from passing vehicles. So it's very difficult.\n\nThe camp is situated on the banks of the Yamuna river. There are too many mosquitoes there. (there is not much that can be done about this)\n\nMost of the shacks they live in have holes in the plastic sheeting on the roofs. S\\\\o all the rain water comes right in their living spaces. This is very difficult.\n\nIf you want to help even with $5 or more, we will make sure that all the funds go to help them. To repair or change the plastic sheets on their roofs, etc. We are also in communication with a foundation in Gurgaon to help them with Solar technology.\n\nIf you want to donate, just paypal me at [luthra.bobby7@gmail.com](mailto:luthra.bobby7@gmail.com). Or if you don't have Paypal, just pm me.\n\nPlease also share her film with your friends, so she can get more votes.

      <li>Title::: 'Most people in India really take our freedom for granted.'<br />Body: 'People in India really don\'t understand what freedom did for our country. The process of our freedom struggle, the unification by Patel and Nehru gave our country dignity. Look at how so many of the other countries have been constantly toyed around with as pawns in the greater global game to only have their lives, dignities and freedoms snatched from them. \n\nAfghanistan was an okay country back in the 60s. Sure they had Islamism back then as well, but it wasn\'t as widespread. In fact on a majority of social indicators, they were far ahead of India as well. Now after four decades of Cold War proxy wars and Taliban wars, the entire country has basically been trampled on and dreams and hopes of millions of people smashed forever. \n\nSame with pretty much all of the middle east. Same with Eastern Europe (Ukraine etc.) that have stagnated since the 90s. \n\nWhat India has accomplished in terms of economic growth despite being a democracy is very rare. To go from the world\'s poorest country and basically being written off as a basket case that would soon disintegrate to now being the fifth biggest economy and constantly climbing, it requires a real severe amount of perseverance and patience. \n\nIf we didn\'t gain our freedom when we did in 1947 and had we been disunited as "South Asia" instead of India, we\'d collectively be worse off than every single other country that has at some point been a failed state. \n\nEven if India doesn\'t do any economic reforms and grows at just 7-8% (a very ordinary growth rate every year), India would be at $ 12 trillion by 2040. If India just removes some of the bureaucratic hurdles and eases labor laws, India could grow at 10-14% every year and easily touch $ 30 trillion by 2040. That would mean better living standards, sudden jump into high income economy and advanced economic status. \n\nThat\'s what our freedom gave us. Don\'t downplay it. Don\'t look down on it. Don\'t joke about it. The independence of India is the single greatest and most important event in 20th century history.

So what\'s going on? From the late 18th century when Hindu texts first started reaching American shores, the religion of the Hindoos was understood as quintessentially irrational vis a vis Protestant Christianity 11/n\nThere is a deeper intellectual background that you can read about in the substack post linked here, but the basic idea was that for early American scholars of comparative religion, the "truth" of a religious belief was a test of its validity  https://hindoohistory.substack.com/p/the-hindoo-and-the-enlightenment … 12/n\nThis way of thinking about religion naturally privileged Protestant Christianity, which was accepted as the evolutionary zenith of religious thought. The Hindoo religion, OTOH, came to represent the opposite. 13/n\nWhereas Protestants sought a divine truth consonant with rationality, the Hindoo was mired in superstition and idolatry; Protestantism embodied progression, while the Hindoo religion was one of declension and gradual degradation. 14/n\nIndeed, it wasn\'t just that the Hindoo religion was backward, it was the Hindoo himself. The passage below is taken from Two Years in India or Some Missionary Lessons, And How They Were Learned. by Rev. Geo W. Isham, published in 1893 15/n\n\nWe\'re told that "the pagans are, in all things, \'too religious.\' The fundamental order of things with them is false and illogical, and has been through the thousands of years of their history" 16/n\nIsham continues: "Through all the ages they have exercised themselves to believe lies and contradictions, and from his earliest efforts the pagan child is trained to thus pervert his mind. And these perversions are religiously sacred." 17/n\nTo come back to the "fanatic" point, b/c Hindoo belief was based on superstition and untruth, it was inherently "fanatical," i.e. irrational. And b/c it was beyond rational justification, the Hindoo\'s faith had to be due to some perversion of the mind (or priestly trickery)18/n\nThis was a deep prejudice in American culture. So deep that even those sympathetic to the Hindoo in American society made their case by emphasizing the "rational" aspects of the tradition (e.g. characterizing Vedanta as a sort of Oriental Unitarianism) 19/n\nIndeed, even when Emerson and Thoreau rebutted missionary polemics against the Hindoo, their critique focused on missionary hypocrisy rather than disputing the underlying argument (e.g. Christianity as practiced is full of superstition and idolatry as well) 20/n\nSo here we see the emergence of the "good hindoo" that stood in contrast to the hindoo depicted in the popular press. The "good hindoo" offered the transcendental wisdom of oriental mysticism, but without the heathen baggage. 21/n\nBut the "good hindoo" far from being static, was a dynamic representation that shifted with larger societal currents. In the early 20th century as Vivekananda\'s Vedanta Society was gaining popularity, even the protestantized hindoo came under attack. 22/n\nIn her essay on "The Heathen Invasion of America" Mabel Potter Daggett traces the origins of the invasion to the world parliament of religions in 1893, and argues that the Vedanta was a gateway to full-on heathenism, idolatry and all 23/n\nHindooHistory\n@HindooHistory\n·\nApr 6, 2021\nReplying to @HindooHistory\nToday the tinkling of temple bells ring out with a derisive, jarring note in a Christian land”\nHindooHistory\n@HindooHistory\n“It was the Congress of Religions at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893 that with a spirit of fine religious toleration beckoned the first holy men from their fastnesses in the Himalayas”\n12:39 AM · Apr 6, 2021\n40\n1\nCopy link to Tweet\nThis contestation continues today, though in a different form. Although critics insist that "hindutiva is not hinduism," in practice this distinction is extremely nebulous, and the label of "hindutva" is applied liberally to anyone who does not toe the ideological line 24/n\nToday\'s "fanatic," like the "hindoo fanatic" of the early 19th century, is one whose "common sense" remains situated in their tradition, rather than the ideas of the elite liberal academy. 25/n\nt is no surprise, then, that "hindutva" as a movement is deliberately kept obscure. That\'s the point. "Hindutva" for the purposes of this new mission can\'t be a legible political ideology, because a projection of the long-standing American paranoia about "hindoo" influence 26/n\nIts contours are sufficiently broad to apply to virtually anyone who speaks out against academic distortions of Hinduism, and if you are an academic then there is a particular pressure to ensure that you remain a "good hindoo" lest your career prospects be threatened. 27/n\nAmerica is a remarkably open society, but the paranoia about hindoo influence is a real one that goes back centuries. A figure like Truschke is not original; she is an archetype. Like Daggett (referenced above) and Katherine Mayo, she embodies a deep cultural tendency 28/n\nAs long as events like this conference are examined without context, the response will continue to be inadequate or mis-targeted.

We even accepted invaders and charmed them to become Indians, like Shaka and kushanas. \n\n\nWe exchanged ideas, we debated religion, our entire nation flipped between Buddhism and Hinduism at times, not by force, violence, but by public debates and consent of individuals. Many religions and faiths always cohabited our lands. We accepted persecuted people all over world, gave them refuge and freedom to keep their faiths and beliefs. Our Kings promoted their faiths, but never forced those on populace. And our ancestors would not have tolerated it either.\n\n\nThis rich history allowed us to persever. To sustain these ideas when foreign invaders raided, conquered and established their religiously extremist empires. They kept defeating our armies, our kingdoms, drained our treasuries, destroyed our temples, looted our homes,\xa0 killed innocents and did unspeakable atrocities. Not one time, for many centuries. They could not defeat India.\n\n\nNot\xa0 completely anyway, at any moment in time. Not because we had great saints and ideas, but we always kept fighting(Using tools like violence, sabotage, war). Idea that our ideology alone was so strong that can defeat physical violence is silly.\n\n\nAnyways, here we are, today, in a free country where our constitutional republic reigns proudly. We are not perfect of course, but seems like we won judgement of history.For now. Its more like our ancestors struggled hard, and also got lucky to gift us this present. How we fight inhumane ideas and how much lucky we get will decide future for our generations ahead. \n\n\nWhether we will live in slavery of tyrants or we will spread freedom to the world and universe, depends on which ideas we promote as ordinary citizens. Our small voices matter. Our courage to speak those ideas matter.\n\n\nBelieve in your ideas and spread them, without fear of retribution or harm. Because our personal fortunes matter nothing if our societies and nations fall in long term, for corruption in our ideas.\n\nIn that spirit, \n\nTolerance of intolerant ideas is not a virtue but highest sin \n\nViolence is better than submissive peace\n\nForcing religious clothing of other humans is not acceptable human behaviour\n\nViolence against someone because he blasphemes or leaves your religion should punishable by law as in all countries in this world and all worlds future humans will colonize.\n\nCriticism of all religions and ideas should be allowed if not promoted. That is our history, and it works to prune out bad ideas. Current censorship regime in India of 'sensetive' issues and violence of goons weakens our society, does not protect it.\n\nEstablishing state religion is wrong\xa0, Nation that does it is a regressive nation and costs should be imposed on it by civilized world. \n\nFreedoms should not exist for those who harm those very freedoms.\n\nTolerance and freedom should be spread all around world by brave humans who could do targeted violence against intolerant, It should be spread by wealthy humans by bribes and influence, should be spread by politicians by coercion. Morally bad tactics should be employed by morally good people to spread these good morals, if necessary.\n\nThose countries who claim to be superpower and those who aspire to be, should burden costs to 'Nation Build' other unfortunate countries. Superpowers don't last long. Nations do, and ideas like democracy and individual freedoms matter."<br />Author: 'chinmay_j'  id: 'pafw74'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pafw74/what_to_learn_from_fall_of_a_nation/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Must Read FREE Lessons For All Indians Invested in Physical Silver, or Other Silver Investments, Learn This Important Strategy to Protect the Value of Your Investments from Market Manipulation'<br />Body: 'Before the recent wild and unrestrained fiat currency printing by Western nations, the price of silver should have been a minimum of $225 per ounce. Due to the printing of paper currency out of thin air, it should now be between $675 - $900 per ounce. However it is currently the bargain price of only $23 per ounce! Why? Because the system (Western governments, banksters, and Wall Street) has supressed the price for decades, in order to make it cheap for the manufacturing industry, to maximise their profits, to the detriment, and the oppression of, ordinary people who own physical silver and silver investments, and countries like India, who mine silver, even as a by-product, and should therefore be a far richer country as a result!\n\nThe price of silver today, is actually less than it was in the 1980\'s!\n\nThis deliberate price suppression keeps silver mining countries and their populations in poverty, enslaved and oppressed, resulting in the youth of India, and other silver mining countries, having to leave their native countries, to go to the so called *"first world"* countries, and become enslaved to the system there, earning pieces of worthless paper, whilst suffering long working hours, poor conditions, enduring racism, missing family and friends, losing traditions and values etc. These countries may seem more \'beautiful\' than India, but there is no beauty in living in a country where you are not wanted, you don\'t get equality, you get discriminated against, harassed, abused, insulted, and only allowed to be there to clean their floors, roads, toilets, run their machines, prepare their food, etc.\n\nDon\'t let the system waste your life, or the lives of your family.

It is obviously against China, and some facts and narratives are... interesting. Examples are:\n\n[Gravitas: More than two million companies \'shut down\' in China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiN1sNec2pE&amp;list=PLP-unBsQHeFg1pq9r4QKFMiZNIaSTyNyN&amp;index=15): 2 millions sounds scary, but if you have a look at [the number of registered companies in China every year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1008055/china-number-of-registered-companies/) (30.34 million in 2017, 34.74 million in 2018), 2 millions doesn\'t even matter. And also, the number "2 millions" is not even considered with newly registered one.\n\n[Gravitas: Is China running out of food?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VweUFkwNQt4&amp;list=PLP-unBsQHeFg1pq9r4QKFMiZNIaSTyNyN&amp;index=13) Palki Sharma started by saying China spends many billions importing grain from US, Canada, Australia and government published a new policy that people should not waste food in restaurants. These are the "proof" according to her that China is having food shortage. Everything looks logical, but let me ask you, what happens first when essentials become short in supply, before government importing them? Hint: onion and oxygen cylinder in India. Yes, price hikes. She describes how bad the food situation is in China without even mentioning the price for grain and meat. Even, when she lists the countries China is importing food from, she didn\'t mention Russia or Kazakhstan, or east Africa, that makes me doubt the authenticity of data source she quoted.\n\nFrom 2 figures below, which country do you think is having food crisis?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdglahiwg1j71.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c472244899a9d5be6a9bd704fc7ef5110eb02576\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vdog4gxg1j71.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770c398bbe406af524a24b4e00d4eac633f6d5b7\n\n[China\'s debt is a ticking time bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIpPTS6zjAg) (2019 Jul), also 1 rupee drops to 0.087 RMB (5 years ago it was 0.10):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbco37sqj1j71.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5905fedef2169f998da0d4f62bfd30c00799006e\n\n[Gravitas: Vietnam stands up to China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfOJrIvvq7s&amp;list=PLP-unBsQHeFg1pq9r4QKFMiZNIaSTyNyN&amp;index=19) (2020 May), also [Vietnam joins RCEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership) (2020 Nov).\n\n[Beijing suffers from \'hazardous\' levels of pollution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=winK_MUl85g&amp;list=PLP-unBsQHeFg1pq9r4QKFMiZNIaSTyNyN&amp;index=14), also [Delhi Air Today Measures 999 On Air Quality Index.

Anybody can explain to me?\n\nAnd many more similar videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelectively displaying facts and biased narratives are just fine, since all media do that. What make it funny is the naïve and sometimes even a bit dumb way WION mislead the facts. My favorite part is that Palki Sharma said [China is going down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiN1sNec2pE), then after 4 months she angrily reported ["No Punishment for China? Chinese exports rise by 21%"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIwy7nhNuz0&amp;list=PLP-unBsQHeFg1pq9r4QKFMiZNIaSTyNyN&amp;index=10&amp;t=50s). You could easily find more if you dig old videos from WION, especially those of Palki Sharma.\n\nWe have also such "patriotic media" in China and I was addicted to it when I was young. They cover everything bad about the rival nations. Of course some of the them are fake and a lot are selected. As I grew older and experience more, I got bored by such **tittytainment**, and don\'t watch any more. Now when I want to learn some events, I have to read articles from different outlets, usually from different languages, to get closer to the fact.\n\nSo I\'m asking, as educated Indian, how do you see WION and its news?\n\nBonus question, what do you think are the gains and losses for India for not signing RCEP?'<br />Author: 'putongren0'  id: 'p9tgrk'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p9tgrk/how_do_educated_indian_feel_about_wion_news/</li>

I have seen it being aired with the farmers protest as well, within the citations of "crimes against the Sikh people by the GoI". \n\nGoing off what I know from what NRI Sikhs present, Jagtar Johal was a UK national who went to India to visit a family wedding and then got arrested, sitting in jail for 500+ days and counting. NRI Sikhs claim that he was tortured in prison with his genitals being electrocuted to sign a blank confession. They also claim that he was arrested for speaking out about injustices that happened during 1984 and that the Indian government issued a fake passport for him with Pakistani stamps on it, using that to frame him. \n\nHowever, I took a bit of time to do some digging around and I found stuff that was not mentioned by them. Punjab Police was apparently on lookout for him because he had links with terrorist group Khalistani Liberation Force, based out of Pakistan. He was in contact with the 2 masterminds behind the killings of prominent Hindu leaders in Punjab. I can\'t seem to find any links that support the grievance of him being arrested for "speaking out against 1984". Foreign media is notorious for not giving the full facts about the situation and I sense that a lot of this is propaganda peddled by Khalistani-sympathizers. Since this was a counter-terrorism operation, it is worth noting that UK and Canadian governments have had terrible track records stopping India-destined terrorism on their soil (see CSIS and AI182 bombing) and had Johal gone back to UK soil, the chances of extradition are nil.\n\nAnyone know more about this situation?

He passed away last year. My grandmother gets the pension now after his demise in her account. \n\nToday she received a call from this number - 9883968285 from someone who claimed to be from SBI. The person seemed very genuine. He seemed like a very trained call centre employee fluent in both English and Hindi and had a very friendly voice. No reason why someone won\'t think he\'s actually an SBI employee. This person had a lot of information basically. Now I\'m not quite sure if the person used social engineering techniques to deduce some of the information or if he actually had knowledge of all the information. I was not present in the room when the initial conversation took place. \n\nMy grandfather was usually referred to as "&lt;last name&gt; saheb" by everyone in his bank. The person referred to him by the same which further added to his genuineness. My grandmother thought this guy is legit someone who knew my grandfather. He said that my grandfather\'s bank account and card is still active and is going to be deactivated since he has passed away (do note that the acct number and card number he mentioned were correct). I\'m not sure whether his account is active currently but that\'s irrelevant. He told my grandmother not to worry as he can help her keep his bank account active and help with other formalities too. \n\nI was in the other room at that time and heard that my grandmother was talking to someone from the bank which seemed very unusual. My grandmother handed me the phone and I continued the conversation from there. The person sounded very legit and said some formalities are needed to be done. I said sure as I also initially thought he\'s from the bank considering the professionalism. \n\nHe then proceeded to ask me for the card expiry date which confirmed my suspicions he\'s a scam artist. I told him I\'m going to report his number to all the authorities and hung up. After the call, I explained my grandmother in great detail how old people get scammed, and never to engage with calls from bank. Bank usually never calls.\n\nNow my grandmother is well off and has her money/savings spread in a lot of accounts so even if she had gotten successfully scammed we wouldn\'t go broke by any means. But I\'m thinking about the poor old folks who have a considerable amount of their life savings in one or two accounts. These scammers probably scam such vulnerable people every single day. \n\nI request everyone who\'s reading this. Please educate the elderly in your family to stay alert. And why just the old folks, it helps to initiate the conversation with everyone you know. By having such conversation rolling, people would be more vigilant about these calls. \n\nI hope these scammers rot in hell for scamming old vulnerable people and even widows.'<br />Author: 'rajjjjk'  id: 'p86wbb'<br />Score:63<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p86wbb/my_grandmother_almost_got_scammed_today_please_be/</li>

Rest is compilation of 3 of my past posts.\n\nhttps://archive.is/fG8Jg\n\n#Religious Crusades of CIA\n\n&gt;Among the murkier chapters in the history of the Central Intelligence Agency, the attempt to destabilize societies around the world using religion warrants attention. Allen Dulles, who headed the CIA in its early years, was responsible for using religious groups as cover for intelligence activities. He had used them for spying even when he was part of the Office of Strategic Services which was CIA’s predecessor.\n\n&gt;*After the creation of the CIA , Christian missionaries played a very important role in destabilizing various countries and in carrying out espionage activities on behalf of the CIA. The most recent high profile example of the US using religious missionaries as Trojan horses to cause disturbances in India was in the case of the agitation against the Kudankulam nuclear power plant. This agitation came after a cable to the CIA from the US Consulate in Mumbai (Wikileaks cable 06MUMBAI1803_a) informed the agency that “we feel that the USG must move forward to enable our companies to compete in the next stage of India’s nuclear future. Otherwise we may have to watch bitterly as third countries become the first to benefit commercially from the environment that our diplomacy has created.”*\n______________________\n\n**After the creation of the CIA , Christian missionaries played a very important role in destabilizing various countries and in carrying out espionage activities on behalf of the CIA.**\n\n*The CIA-church connection had been one of the topics of an investigation conducted by the US Senate in 1975.* \n\nCoincidentally, it came to be known as the Church Committee as it was headed by Senator Frank Church, and **according to the report of this Senate Committee, the CIA had informed them of at least “a total of 14 covert arrangements which involved direct operational use of 21 individuals” who were American clergy or missionaries. The report went on to state that a few of them “were current in August 1975, and according to the CIA, they were used only for intelligence collection, or, in one case, for a minor role in preserving the cover of another asset.”**\n\n\nThe following excerpt from the Church Committee report speaks for itself and highlights the dangers of allowing foreign missionaries into India.\n\n**“[T]he CIA paid salaries, bonuses, or expenses to the religious personnel, or helped to fund projects run by them. Most of the individuals were used for covert action purposes. Several were involved in large covert action projects of the mid-sixties, which were directed at “competing” with communism in the Third World….**\n\nOf the recent relationships, the most damaging would appear to be that of a U.S. priest serving the CIA as an informant on student and religious dissidence.\n\n**Of the earlier cases, one exemplifies the extent to which the CIA used confidential pastoral relationships. The CIA used the pastor of a church in a Third World country as a “principal agent” to carry out covert action projects, and as a spotter, assessor, asset developer, and recruiter. He collected information on political developments and on personalities. He passed CIA propaganda to the local press.**\n\n**According to the CIA’s description of the case, the pastor’s analyses were based on his long-term friendships with the personalities, and the agents under him were “well known to him in his professional life.” At first the CIA provided only occasional gifts to the pastor in return for his services; later, for over ten years, the CIA paid him a salary that reached $11,414 annually.”**\n\n**The figure of $11,414 in this excerpt gives us a clue that the country in question is most likely India as this amount translates to a nice round figure of one lakh rupees using the currency exchange rate of the day. In addition to being a round figure, it was also a substantial amount of money in the 1970s in India.**\n\n___________________________________________\n\n#CIA &amp; missionary org Summer Institute of Linguistics\n\nOne religious organization that has received money from USAID and has been outed as a front for the CIA is the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) which was set up to translate the bible into various languages and distribute them around the world. Together with its sister organization, the Wycliffe Bible Translators, and its subsidiary, the Jungle Aviation and Radio Services (JAARS) which operates several aircraft and radio stations, SIL became a very powerful and destructive force in the world.\n\n**In the 1970s, several Latin American countries including Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Peru held SIL responsible for advancing the interests of the American intelligence agencies (see Wikileaks cables 1975BOGOTA06132_b, 1975MEXICO05045_b, 1975LIMA08739_b and 1976LIMA01274_b) and Brazil expelled SIL’s missionaries from the country for acting as cover for geologists searching for mineral deposits in the Amazon basin. SIL’s clout in the American establishment was such that they were able to bypass the diplomats and directly seek helicopters from the military to carry out their mission in Papua New Guinea (see Wikileaks cable 1973CANBER02655_b).**\n\n**SIL has been accused of drug trafficking, smuggling emeralds and uranium, and even waging germ warfare that destroyed many native tribes. In their book THY WILL BE DONE, The Conquest of the Amazon: Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of Oil, the authors Gerard Colby and Charlotte Dennett document the extensive connections of Wycliffe Bible Translators with Nelson and John D. Rockefeller and their takeover of the resources in the Amazon basin countries.**\n\nSIL’s partner in India is the Indian Institute of Cross Cultural Communication based in Nashik. An example of the kind of work executed by this institute can be found on the resume of Wayne Dye who is on the faculty of the Graduate Institute of Linguistics and who worked at the IICCC as a consultant for SIL. According to his own description, he conducted seminars “for Indians engaged in cross-cultural church planting” while at the IICCC.\n\n____________________\n\n#Wendy Doniger &amp; her US intel infested mentors &amp; family\n\nIn context of CIA acknowledging its use of missionaries for its purpose, the background of Wendy Doniger becomes interesting, particularly as 3 of her mentors worked for US intel &amp; her India visit being  sponsored by AIIS which shared many officials who had earlier worked in US intelligence. \n\n&gt;**The links of AIIS to the intelligence community was very strong during the days of Wendy Doniger’s association with the organization. Its Director in 1964 was Richard D. Lambert who had been stationed in India as part of the counterintelligence department during the second world war. He was succeeded by Thomas Simons who was also part of the intelligence community and who had headed the South Asian branch of the Office of Intelligence Research in the US Department of State. A key member of the founding group of AIIS was Richard Park who went on to become the India scholar at AIIS. Park was also part of the infamous Asia Foundation.**\n\n&gt;**Despite earlier denials, it was revealed in 1967 that the Asia Foundation had received funds from the CIA and it had in turn funneled money to Indian groups in the guise of funding cultural and educational programs. This revelation led to an outcry in the Indian parliament on the role of AIIS and other groups. Even the journal Seminar which was published by the brother of the Marxist professor Romila Thapar devoted an entire issue to the topic of “Academic Colonialism,” but that was before Romila Thapar received money and titles from the American establishment and started supporting them.**\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p0e537/the_asia_foundation_is_a_cia_propietary/\n\nUS Govt website itself states that Asia Foundation is a CIA proprietary organisation. More on Asia foundation/AIIS can be read here.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/p6u616/daughterinlaw_of_missionary_working_to_convert/\n\nWendy Doniger\'s father Lester Doniger was a hardcore missionary who published journals as Pulpit Digest &amp; Pastoral Psychology &amp; awarded radio programs lauding “the program had 6 million listeners weekly and there were approximately 70 million without church affiliations toward whom the program was directed.”\n\n&gt;Wendy\'s father Lester Doniger became the president of SIECUS (Sex Information &amp; Educational Council of US). For reasons unknown (or known?) SIECUS got supported by US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and was funded by Ford Foundation- a known CIA affiliate. Under Lester\'s stewardship, SIECUS was funded by Steven Rockefeller and James Warburg of the influential banking family, two key people who have helped shape US foreign policy and bankrolled several overt and covert American government programs.\n\n&gt;Yet another family member, Dennis M. O’Flaherty, another husband of Wendy Doniger, was a Russian language expert whose doctoral thesis was related to propaganda in Russia. He was sent to Moscow during the cold war with a grant from the International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), a government aided organization that was set up as a public-private partnership in 1967 to take over the responsibilities of the Inter-University Committee on Travel Grants (IUCTG). The Soviet Union had accused professors and scholars sent by the IUCTG of working for the CIA and expelled a few of them over the years.\n\n&gt;**IREX scholars too were accused of espionage activities (for example, by Yugoslavia) and IREX continued to be part of the American national security plans after the Soviet-Eastern European Research and Training Act of 1983 was passed. During the Congressional hearings before the act was passed, one of the supporters of the act who taught at Columbia University made the point that research in universities on the Soviet bloc countries should be treated as “utmost importance to the national security of the United States.” More recently, Jim Leach, former Congressman and former Chairperson of the National Endowment of the Humanities, admitted in a speech that there were “connections between the humanities and national security.”**\n\nHere we are beginning to see the link between church, US academia &amp; US intel. Here\'s a bigger one.\n\n#Wendy Doniger\'s mentor in Harvard &amp; in Oxford were Daniel Ingalls &amp; RC Zaehner respectively, both associated with US &amp; Brit intel\n\n&gt;After working for Gordon Wasson, Lester Doniger’s daughter was placed at Harvard University where her guide, Daniel Ingalls, was a known intelligence agent who had spied against Indian freedom fighters. She then spent time in Oxford, and strangely, her adviser RC Zaehner too was an intelligence agent. Zaehner, who was also a racist, had headed the failed British attempt in 1951 to overthrow the Mossadegh government in Iran and put the Iranian oilfields in the control of the British.\n\nHere\'s Daniel Ingall\'s eulogy from Harvard gazette\n\n&gt;In 1941 he persuaded the Senior Fellows to send him to India, where he worked on Indian logic with M.M. Sri Kalipada Tarkacharya at the Sanskrit Research Institute in Calcutta. After Pearl Harbor he returned and entered the O.S.S. In 1942 he and his colleague Richard Frye traveled as civilians to Afghanistan, where his job in Kabul was to watch for contacts by Indians (then British subjects) with Axis agents.\n\nhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/02/daniel-henry-holmes-ingalls/\n\nRobert Zaehner\'s wikipedia page has a separate section on his activities for British intelligence. Eg\n\n&gt;During World War II starting in 1943, he served as a British intelligence officer at their Embassy in Tehran. Often he was stationed in the field among the mountain tribes of northern Iran. After the war he also performed a more diplomatic role at the Tehran embassy.[11][12] Decades later another British intelligence officer, Peter Wright, described his activities:\n\n&gt;"I studied Zaehner\'s Personal File. He was responsible for MI6 counterintelligence in Persia during the war. It was difficult and dangerous work. The railway lines into Russia, carrying vital military supplies, were key targets for German sabotage. Zaehner was perfectly equipped for the job, speaking the local dialects fluently, and much of his time was spent undercover, operating in the murky and cutthroat world of countersabotage. By the end of the war his task was even more fraught. The Russians themselves were trying to gain control of the railway, and Zaehner had to work behind Russian lines, continuously at risk of betrayal and murder by pro-German or pro-Russian... .\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Charles_Zaehner#British_intelligence\n\n*CIA\'s quest for drugs &amp; Wendy Doniger\'s mentor. Yet another of Wendy\'s mentor was a SIL affiliated Gordon Masson was funded by CIA to search for potent drugs. He recruited Wendy to dig out information on Soma in 60s.*\n\nThings take a bizarre turn in the context of SIL and its connection to drugs. When LSD was first synthesized by the Swiss drug firm Sandoz, it was clear that there was no medicinal use for it, but the CIA was interested in it as part of its behavioral alteration program. The CIA even set up a project named MKULTRA to research “behavioral modification.” According to a Senate hearing in 1977, CIA used many unwitting persons for experimentation as part of this project.\n\nOver the years, they infiltrated many groups and distributed narcotic and psychedelic drugs with the twin aims of observing their effects and weakening the groups they were targeting. How CIA turned Afghanistan into a failed state by encouraging it to become the world\'s biggest production of opium from minimal production in the 70s can be read here.\n\nhttps://archive.is/sCOVW\n\nIt is in CIA’s use of drugs that R. Gordon Wasson and SIL come into the picture. Wasson was the author of an article titled Seeking the Magic Mushroom in Life magazine in 1957 and the article is considered a path breaking one in the ‘psychedelic movement.’ He was close to CIA’s Director Allen Dulles and had gone on an expedition to Mexico in search of the “Magic Mushroom” with funds from the CIA. Wasson has acknowledged at the end of his article that he collaborated with missionaries belonging to the Summer School of Linguistics. John Marks, a former State Department official who worked at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, discusses Wasson in his book The Search for the Manchurian Candidate..\n\nSometime in 1962, Gordon Wasson recruited a young lady named Mrs. Arthur Gudwin to dig out information about the source of soma from Sanskrit texts. Mrs. Gudwin, also known as Wendy Gudwin,\n\n#*To summarise: 3 of Wendy Doniger\'s mentors are acknowledged assets of US &amp; British intelligence in pre-World War II era. Wendy Doniger\'s India visit was sponsored by CIA front AIIS which shared many officials with CIA. Wendy\'s father was a missionary &amp; was funded by Ford &amp; Rockefeller- CIA affiliated foundations. Wendy\'s relatives were acamedicians in IREX, part of the American national security plans after the Soviet-Eastern European Research and Training Act of 1983 was passed.*\n_______________________________________\n\n#Audrey Truschke following the pattern of her protege being affiliated with missionaries &amp; funded by cold war linked US federal orgs\n\nIt should be unsurprising then that Wendy\'s protege Audrey also comes from a missionary background (her  father-in law is on mission to convert as man Hindus as possible in India) and she is as equally a Hinduphobe intent on demonising Hindus &amp; Indians. More interestingly, Audrey has been funded multiple times in the last decade by "National Endowment for Humanities" which has been linked by multiple universities like Univeristy of Pennsylvania &amp; Michigan State University with Cold war efforts. More interestingly, the Humanities Caucus lobbying to Congress demanidng more funds for NEH explicitly states that NEH is essential to "protecting national security" and  links CIA success to NEH "virtually all of CIA analysts &amp; diplomats are graduates of the humanities".\n\n&gt;Building a solid foundation in the humanities becomes even more vital to U.S. interests as the world becomes more interconnected. In addition to protecting our national security, the knowledge and competencies represented by humanities fields are critical to a broad range of U.S. interests: fostering a globally competitive workforce, strengthening civic engagement, and preserving our cultural heritage. That’s why virtually all of our CIA analysts, State Department officials, and diplomats at embassies across the globe are graduates of the humanities -- as are leaders ranging from the late Steve Jobs to former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey!\n\nhttp://www.statehumanities.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FY21-NEH-funding-letter-DC.pdf\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p6pn97/daughterinlaw_of_missionary_working_to_convert/\n\nTruschke is organising a xenophobic "Dismantling Global Hindutva" conference sponsored by 45+ US universities like Harvard, Princeton, Columbia etc on the anniversary of 9/11. Key material for conference provided by Kingdom of Saudi funded anti-Islamophobia Bridge Initiative of  Georgetown university\n___________________________________\n\n#Michael Witzel, proponent of AIT &amp; his collaboration with missionaries\n\nYet another reknowned Indologist in Harvard collaborates with missionaries in India. \n\nDFN is an organisation based out of Colorado with the objective is to convert Hindus in India using the trope of ‘caste persecution.’ John Gilman, one DFN’s board members has openly declared the following about their plans for India and the Hindus:\n\n&gt;“The worship of a hundred million gods will disappear. Idolatry will be cast down. But, what will replace it? National Dalit leaders plead to the Church in India, saying, ‘Come and tell us about your Jesus. Teach us your scriptures.’ They believe this is the only hope for India, a nation that could be on the brink of a bloody civil war – or on the brink of an outpouring of the Holy Spirit unlike any in history. There has never been a better soul-winning opportunity than right now in the nation of India.”\n\n&gt;A few years ago, when a subpoena was served on them and the person serving the subpoena was sent to the address of Dalit Freedom Network, he found that it was actually a Church!\n\nIn California textbooks controversy, he was revealed to be working in coordination with Dalit Freedom Network to enact changes in portrayal of Hinduism in California textbooks and he event went as far as advising them to remove their missionary links from wikipedia to enhance their credibility.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p6nijx/so_the_venerated_harvard_linguist_promoter_of_pie/'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p858tl'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p858tl/1975_senate_confirmed_cia_paid_missionaries_in/</li>

Yet, he still had an ambition of becoming the Wazir of the Mughal court. \n\nOn receiving information that the Emperor had  summoned him, he immediately set off Delhi .At Hodal, 55 miles from the capital, Nizam-ul-mulk was met by the Wazir Qamar-ud-din Khan and all his Mughal troops. The Wazir\'s harem was also a part of the retinue. The Nizam\'s son Ghazi-ud-din Khan Firuz Jang had now the pleasure of seeing his father, and presenting his newly married consort Qamar-un-nissa Begam (eldest daughter of the Wazir). Then they proceeded in a slow march till they reached the fort and durbar.\n\n\nThe Nizam was bestowed with all sorts of gifts and privileges. He was given the highest title of Asaf Jah, gifted the \'charqab\', or a special suit reserved only for the members of the Mughal dynasty. He resided at the mansion of Sadullah Khan, the finest mansion in Delhi. The subahs of Agra and Malwa, belonging to Sawai Jai Singh and Bajirao respectively were given to Firoz Jang, his son.\n\n\nPREPARATION-\n\nSeeing these developments, Bajirao decided to head north once again to confront the Nizam. Chimaji Appa, his brother and an able military commander was recalled from the Konkan, where he was battling the Portugese.\n\nThe strength of the enemy forces are mentioned in an contemporary letter written by Chimaji Appa himself-\n\n"Along with the Nizam, his son Gaziuddin, the king of Orchha and Datia, and the son of Jai Singh and Ahir and Rohilla they have an army of fifty thousand. Sadat Khan\'s nephew and Kota\'s king Durjansal will bring twenty thousand troops. Chhatrasala\'s grandson Sabha Singh and Sawai Jai Singh\'s son appear to have been forcibly brought by the Nizam."[4]\n\nExcept for this, the Nizam also had the finest Mughal artillery and 3000 camels with rockets mounted on them.\n\nThe Nizam had informed his son, Nasir Jung to march northwards and cut off the Marathas by being stationed at Aurangabad with almost 20,000 troops. The Nizam himself crossed the Yamuna at Agra first and then again crossed it near Kalpi to enter Bundelkhand.[5]\n\nThe Maratha army was almost 80,000 cavalry. Bajirao moved northwards from Pune onto Malwa. He stationed Chimaji at Varangaon to prevent any moves by Nasir Jung. He himself them crossed the Narmada at Punasa, slightly east of Omkareshwar.[6]\n\nThe stage was set for the battle\n\n\nTHE BATTLE- \n\n\nThe initial conflict is described by Bajirao in a letter to Chimaji Appa, where he states-\n\n"The Son of Sawai Jai Singh and the Bundelas of Sambha Singh with the Jats and Rajwadis took position to use their artillery. The Nizam stood at the back. Our army under Rajshri Ranoji Shinde and Rajshri Pilaji Jadhavrao and Sayaji Gujar rose against the Rajput army. One and a half hundred Rajputs were killed. Fifty or sixty of our men were killed. Two hundred wounded. In the same way, a hundred horses fell. But the Nizam watched the spectacle. In front of the Rajputs there is a canal which prevented us from finishing them off. Anyway. Now we are sitting on the stage of two rockets from Nawab\'s camp."[7]\n\nThe above battle took place on 15th December. The city of Bhopal was promptly put under siege and all provisions to the city were cut off. Describing the dire conditions of the Nizam\'s army, Bajirao states-\n\n"The Nawab sits on his clephant all day. He is in a difficult situation.  Food has become scarce. In four days one rupee-worth flour has gone up four times in his camp. There is no forage for elephants and horses. One day they fed the animals the bark of trees and plants in the lake. The Rajputs and Bundele do not trust the Nawab and he doesn\'t trust them either. The Nizam was an intelligent man, in his old age he has adopted the wrong strategy"[8]\n\nBetween 20th December and 28th December, the Nizam\'s army was facing a famine. He wanted to negotiate with the Marathas, but these failed. Finally, he capitulated and signed away the entire province of Malwa.  Bajirao wrote to Chimaji Appa-\n\n"Those(Nizam) who did not take the names of chauthai and sardeshmukhi wrote these words in the Malwa  Darobast. It is difficult for the Nawabs to accept these things. He gave his sons subedari of Malwa away, and was left staring into kalapaant(end of time)  . But what will he do? The crisis had to be witnessed."[9]\n\nAFTERMATH-\n\nThis was by far one of the most humiliating defeats the Nizam had faced. All the privileges and grandeur at Delhi came crashing down with this battle, along with his hopes and ambitions.\n\nBrahmedraw Swami, a saint of South India, wrote to Bajirao, congratulating him and said-\n\n"The Lord has granted three achievements to you! First the defeat of the Siddi, second, Delhi and yesterday you defeated the Mughal sudedar"[10]\n\nReferences-\n\n1- Foreword in V.G Dighe\'s "Peshwa Bajirao  and the Maratha Expansion"\n\n2,3- The entire section is taken from Later Mughals, vol 2, pp 300-301 and Era of Bajirao, pp 298\n\n4- Marathi Riyasat, vol 4, pp 371\n\n5- Era of Bajirao, pp 299\n\n6- Ibid, pp 299\n\n7- Brahmedra Swami, charitra aur patravyahar, no.33\n\n8- Ibid, no.33\n\n9- Ibid, no.35\n\n10- Selections from the Peshwa Daftar, vol 9, no.22'<br />Author: 'Vermakimkc'  id: 'p81it1'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p81it1/the_battle_of_bhopal/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'US academicians in California erased India in history books replacing all references of India with "ancient South Asia" and replaced Hinduism with "Ancient Indian religion".Endevaour led by Kamala Visweswaran actively working for FOIL &amp; ISI linked FOSA.'<br />Body: "https://www.opindia.com/2016/03/academics-protest-over-proposal-to-consider-that-india-didnt-exist-at-all-before-1947/\n\nOpen Letter by Vamsee Juluru in Huffpost\n\n&gt;The decision of the IQC has been in full public view for several days now, and the links were provided on my petition too: India is indeed being “erased,” in several key places in the curriculum, all the way from “ancient South Asia” (with Hinduism now being called “Ancient Indian religion”) to the age of “Islamic civilization” (the new phrase to replace the earlier phrase “India and the Muslim world”). (See the complete list of changes, with Indus Valley edits marked distinctly, here).\n\n&gt;The IQC’s CHSSP committee had already accepted most of their suggestions in March, and but for the strong protest from the community and from other scholars on our petition, might not have even reconsidered them in its meeting on March 24. The issue is not yet settled, since the CDE has to make the final decision in May.\n\nMeanwhile, it would help perhaps if all who care about truth and integrity in journalism (and in education) considered the following facts that the LA Times did not see fit to acknowledge, even in the form of a letter from me and several other scholars:\n\n&gt;-The South Asia Faculty group submitted two letters to the IQC, in November 2015 and again in February 2016 arguing for several changes in the curriculum. Their stated position, spelled out on the top of page 12 in their November letter, was that “most references to India before 1947 should be changed to South Asia.” They also asked for references to “Hinduism” to be changed to “religion of ancient India.”\n\n-&gt;A committee appointed by the Instructional Quality Commission announced in early March that it had accepted a remarkable 62 of the 76 edits suggested by the South Asia Faculty group (compared to virtually none of the changes suggested by several scholars and Hindu community groups).\n\n&gt;-Thirty-six of these edits had to do with simply eliminating the words “India” or “Hinduism” from the curriculum. Were these simply harmless recommendations about the Indus Valley lying in Pakistan today and “South Asia” being more appropriate as the LA Times made it out to be? No. Several edits change the meaning of the lines severely and support the South Asia Studies scholars’ view that there essentially was no “India” before 1947\n\n&gt;- For example, edit 2749 by the South Asia Faculty changed the line “After 1000, Turks from Central Asia, who were recent converts to Islam, began to conquer states in Northwestern India” to “... began to expand their territory across the Indus Valley to parts of the Northern Indian plains.” Is “expanding territory” really the same thing as “conquering states”? Is it not an arrogant dismissal of the lives and social institutions of India to make it seem like there was no conquest, merely an “expansion” into “plains,” into empty geographical space? Terra Nullius, from postcolonial studies scholars at that.\n\n&gt;- Another example, so flawed that the IQC actually reversed this in its March 24 meeting: edit 2781 by the South Asia Faculty changed a line about “the Muslim world... and India” having prospered to “the world of Islamic civilization stretching from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean region” having prospered. For the South Asia Faculty, there was no “India” independent of the “Islamic civilization” apparently.\n\n&gt;- Edit 2814: the South Asia Faculty changed the line “the major Afroeurasian centers - China, India and the Islamic World - were too strong for Europeans to conquer” to “.. the Islamic empires and China - were too strong for Europeans to conquer.”\n\n&gt;- Now, admittedly, the word “India” was not completely erased from the curriculum. It remains in a few places. For example, the South Asia Faculty presumably forgot to change it to “ancient South Asia” when it came to edit 2502 (“Ancient Indian society formed into groups, jatis” and edit 2544 (“Ancient India was patriarchy..”)\n\n&gt;All the facts on this issue are presented on the website scholarsforpeople.org. including the two South Asia Studies faculty letters and the summary of changes accepted by the IQC in March. I hope that the media covering this story will respect their profession and the children of California that this issue ultimately concerns enough to do their work diligently from now on.\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-la-times-lied-about-i_b_9657472\n\n&gt;academic Kamala Visweswaran has been leading the fight to erase references to India (external link), and replace these with 'South Asia' from textbooks in California.\n\n&gt;In February 2016, she petitioned for the erasure of references to India in California textbooks, to be replaced by 'South Asia.'\n\n&gt;Earlier, in 2015, she was part of the petition urging Silicon Valley companies to boycott Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit and to not work with India (external link). She was part of earlier petitions to prevent Modi as Gujarat's chief minister to come to the US.\n\n&gt;Visweswaran has also been actively involved with FOIL (Forum of Inquilabi Leftists) and the related FOSA (Forum of South Asia), self-described 'radical activist' organisations whose members support various violent insurgencies in India, including those by ultra-left 'Maoists.'\n\nhttps://www.rediff.com/news/column/india-out-south-asia-in-how-academics-ill-serve-us/20160505.htm\n\n&gt;Very briefly, FOSA is a combination of FOIL and the Pakistan-American Association,with very apparent sponsorship from the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence, per the Pakistani media [5]. Led by Gera, Ra(h)man, Vinay Lal, Mainland Chinese CIIS graduate student(s) working for Chatterji , and several Pakistanis.\n\n&gt;Sometime in April-May 2005, FOSA, which had received sponsorship from the Pakistan American Alliance (PAA), took out a public demonstration jointly in San Francisco. One of the “highlights” of that demonstration included a prominent placard that proclaimed “ALLAH WILL DESTROY THE TERRORIST STATE OF INDIA.”\n\n&gt;When outrage ensued at this appalling, open call for the destruction of India, FOSA resorted to blatant cover-up by removing all references to PAA from its website. The complete account of FOSA’s chicanery in this connection is available in these documents:\n\nhttps://www.dharmadispatch.in/commentary/ideological-merchants-of-the-genocide-against-hindus-in-kashmir-the-symbolism-of-angana-chatterji"<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p7xaec'<br />Score:426<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p7xaec/us_academicians_in_california_erased_india_in/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Nehru's Big blunder by Eminent Economist ARVIND PANAGARIYA"<br />Body: 'As India enters its 75th year of independence, we must set the goal of bringing genuine prosperity to all by the 100th year. But the occasion is also an opportunity to introspect why India has not achieved this goal already. After all, 75 years is a long time and some countries have become prosperous in less than this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is commonplace to trace our economic failure during the first several decades to Nehruvian socialism. But this begs the question: Precisely which features of it? Superficially, one may point the finger at Nehru’s push for a progressively larger share of the public sector in the ownership of the means of production so that profits will translate into public revenues rather than private wealth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile this intrusion of the public sector was surely a factor, it was not the real key to the failure. Instead, it was Nehru’s decision to frontload his development model with highly capital-intensive, heavy industry at a time when investable capital was highly scarce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNehru’s socialism is often likened to Fabian socialism, which rejects the revolutionary doctrines of Marxism and takes a more moderate approach to it. What is less well-known is that till at least 1936, Nehru had subscribed to a far more radical form of socialism, bordering communism. In this phase, he had come to the view that imperialism inevitably resulted from capitalism since capitalist nations needed colonies as the sources of raw materials and markets for finished products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt followed that socialism worldwide was the only way to defeat imperialism and that international trade inevitably gave rise to imperialist tendencies. “We wanted neither to be victims of an imperialist power nor to develop such tendencies ourselves,” he wrote when explaining the rationale for economic self-sufficiency as an objective for a post-Independence India in The Discovery of India.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe conventional approach to seeking self-sufficiency while industrialising the nation would have been to follow the import-substitution industrialisation (ISI) model. This would have entailed protection to assembly activities in the first stage, components production in the second stage, machines necessary to produce components and assembly activities in the third stage and machines to produce machines in the fourth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Nehru never saw protection as the means to industrialisation or self-sufficiency. In his thinking, the twin objectives had to be achieved by adjusting the production basket to consumption needs of people. But a decision still had to be made regarding the sequence in which to phase out the production of final products, components and machines over time. Here Nehru went for exactly the opposite of the sequence that the ISI model recommended. He placed heavy industry consisting of products such as steel and machines at the beginning of the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a speech delivered in 1956, as India embarked upon the path-setting second five-year plan, Nehru outlined his approach thus, “Previously people’s idea of industrialisation was one of increasing the output of consumer goods, with consequent employment. The idea now is … we must start from the heavy, basic, mother industries. … We must start with the production of iron and steel on a large scale. We must start with the production of the machine which makes the machine.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNehru saw heavy industry as essential for self-sufficiency as well. In a speech in 1953, he had argued, “One thing is clear to me that if we do not develop heavy industry here then we either eliminate all modern things such as railways, airplanes and guns, … or else import them. But to import them from abroad is to be slaves of foreign countries.” He expressed these views in numerous speeches throughout his tenure as prime minister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe strategy brought with it many unintended consequences. All available capital was reserved for heavy industry. Given the meagre amount of capital, the scale of production in each product line within heavy industry still remained suboptimal. In parallel, light manufactures were relegated to household and small enterprises where they too remained subject to production at suboptimal scale. With higher inflation at home than abroad and a fixed exchange rate, most products soon became uncompetitive against their foreign counterparts and had to be protected through strict import licensing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeavy industry created few jobs for the unskilled. Simultaneously, the demand for light-industry products and services remained constrained by domestic incomes, which grew at a snail’s pace. The result was a painfully slow transition of workers from below-subsistence agriculture into industry and services. The proportion of workforce in agriculture, which stood at 69.7% in 1951, remained stuck at 69.5% in 1961 and 69.7% in 1971. No reduction in poverty was achieved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough India began dismantling the Nehru model in 1991, journey away from it has been slow due to the intellectual legacy and inherited industry structure. Socialist-era patronage produced intellectuals who, as educators, have continued to hardwire the future generations of bureaucrats and politicians in the old ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEntrepreneurs, likewise, invest where they have tasted success and few of them have done so in large-scale manufacturing of light manufactures, where the potential for well-paid jobs for the masses lies. That has meant a continued slow pace of transformation.'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'p7nm3s'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p7nm3s/nehrus_big_blunder_by_eminent_economist_arvind/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'While India &amp; Hindus were demonised by US based orgs like Obama awarded SADHANA for national song of Vande Mataram,saying it is oppression of Muslims, national anthem of Bangladesh, a Muslim country, translates to “O Mother mine, the words from your lips are nectar to my ears.”'<br />Body: 'In December 2019, Sadhana endorsed a convoluted and Hinduphobic article on “Bharat Mata,” (India depicted as mother), where the author claimed that this symbol, held in high reverence by hundreds of millions of Indians and Hindus is actually a “…RSS-constructed, savarna [meaning upper caste], North Indian, Aryan vision of the mother” who can only bear sons. Mouthful indeed! Furthermore, the same author claimed that famous Hindu freedom fighters and spiritual leaders like Sri Aurobindo and Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay were architects of Hindu nationalism and endorsed hatred towards Muslims (both leaders revered India as a female form of the divine).\n\nHowever, selective history and propaganda can only go so far. Viswanath, Sadhana and this author conveniently hide the fact that the idea of ‘Bharat Mata’ became a uniting factor in India in the early 20th century. So much so that in 1918, Mahatma Gandhi inaugurated the Bharat Mata Temple in Varanasi (Banaras) in the presence of Sardar Patel and Abdul Gaffar Khan. Looking back on this spectacular phenomenon, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote in his autobiography: “It is curious how one cannot resist the tendency to give an anthropomorphic form to a country…India becomes Bharat Mata…Some such pictures rouse the emotions of hundreds of thousands.” Similarly, the great freedom fighter Chandrashekar Azad, who was sentenced to 15 whip lashes by the British, cried “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” at every single lash. Are all these freedom fighters and leaders ‘Hindutva extremists’ because they embraced the idea of Bharat Mata?\n\nWhat Viswanath, Sadhana and their cohorts conveniently fail to mention is that Sri Lanka’s national anthem starts with “Sri Lanka Matha….Namo Namo Matha” and is sung by all, including Muslims. Similarly, the national anthem of Bangladesh (a Muslim majority country) is “Amar Sonar Bangla,” and has words that translate to “O Mother mine, the words from your lips are nectar to my ears.” Are these countries endorsing ‘Hindu extremism?’\n\nBut, Viswanath, Sadhana and the rest of the ‘progressive Hindu’ gang has perfected the formula of conjuring up Hinduphobia out of thin air.\n\nhttps://www.ahouseofcards.net/sunita-viswanath/\n\n&gt; In response to recent Church attacks, Sri Lanka banned burqa and required any Mosque speeches to be pre-approved. Just recently Switzerland attempted to ban any external funding to the Mosques in their country. Hungary &amp; Poland are very wary of bringing any Syrian refugees and blocked any attempt to bring them into their country. Myanmar understood the civilization threat of demography and radical supremacist mindset of Islam and used the army to purge Rohingya Muslims.\n\n&gt;Europe (as reported in ForeignPolicy.com) is increasingly wary of Islamism and has taken steps such as banning foreign funding (as Austria did) or limiting it (as the Netherlands is discussing); training Imams (as Germany does) and deporting radical ones (Italy deports more than any other country); and cutting public funding to organizations connected to Islamist networks for religious, social, pro-integration, anti-Islamophobia, or radicalization prevention activities (Sweden recently removed funding for a Muslim Brotherhood youth group that did not “fulfil the democracy requirement” necessary to receive aid).

      <li>Title::: 'Book Review of The Blood Telegram , a non fiction expose on the 1971 War for Bangladesh'<br />Body: "I usually shy away from historical  non-fiction, specifically from the political subgenre. The reason: the tendency of many of these authors ,no doubt highly educated on the subject matter, to nonetheless steer off course from a concise narrative and instead go into detailed minutiae more apt for an academically inclined audience rather  than the general public. \n\nHowever, curiously just leafing through the first pages of [The Blood Telegram](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18213097-the-blood-telegram) by Gary Bass got me immediately hooked to his accounts of the various events behind the scenes in India, Pakistan and the US that lead to the ethnic genocide of Bengalis in former East Pakistan in 1971 and the resulting war for its independence from West Pakistan with the help of the Indian Army.  \n\nThe chapters are laid out in a very accessible format and read out like an engaging novel of political intrigue of the likes of Frederick Forsyth. The motivations of all players, from Nixon and Kissinger in the US to Gandhi and Haskar , and even to the Yahya Khan, are presented in a manner that the common reader can easily comprehend. \n\nBut really though, the main culprit that lead to this horrible episode in history, as the book seems to suggest, is the short sighted realpolitik of Kissinger. If the conversations back and forth between Nixon and his Secretary of State , as revealed in leaked recorded tapes , are to be really believed, then the basis for their seemingly passive idea of realpolitik, that foreign policy be more practical than ideological, falls flat on its face with many of their decisions based more on their personal emotions rather than an cold objective appraisal of things(Many such examples are mentioned in the book).  If Nixon and Co. really wanted to maintain the status quo in South Asia without making India into an influential powerhouse(which they personally thought would make her part of the Soviet bloc) , then there were still so many options they could have gone for rather than aggressively arming up West Pakistan even during an official arms embargo. Nixon acted more out of his own personal desire to not compromise on a China deal, with West Pakistan as the mediator, even at the expense of a genocide. This way, he could claim to be the first US president to establish diplomatic ties with the then reclusive China and hope for a better chance at re-election. That was all that mattered to him , with realpolitik being just a façade.\n\nConversely, while I personally remain critical of many of Indira Gandhi's later policies during her tenure as India's PM, I can now at least understand her rationale for the decisions she took with regard to this specific series of events. We often do tend to forget that India's current political and communal climate, regardless of how the media plays it out, is still much more stable than it was back then in the '70s. Within such an environment,  to her credit, she did play her cards very coolly in a way that served both India's political interests and also helped the Bengali struggle for Independence. Too bad, she made such glaringly bad decisions later on in life. \n\nHowever, the one true hero in this book, who looked more towards human ideals than any political self interest, is Archer Blood, the then   U. S. consul general   of Dhaka. Risking his career and future prospects, he redoubled on his efforts of tirelessly reporting the genocide  to the White House in routine telegrams. Were it not for these telegrams, it seems doubtful that military atrocities in East Pakistan would have been seen internationally more than a mere crackdown of local civil unrest.   As written in the epilogue, Blood's career was completely ruined after Bangladesh and it was made even more so upon Nixon and Kissinger's insistence. \n\nIn the end, regardless of what one's personal inclinations might be towards these political figures or their worldview, I would highly recommend reading this book to get a much closer look at their thought processes revolving around 1971."<br />Author: 'KlutzyAirport'  id: 'p7dw8x'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p7dw8x/book_review_of_the_blood_telegram_a_non_fiction/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'While wheel on our national flag is called Ashoka chakra,wheel has been a vital symbol for Indians since antiquity.From 6000 year old spoked wheel amulet &amp; spoked wheels on tablets representing d sun in Harappa;to wheel representing sun,cosmos,time,Vishnu in Vedas to Chakravartin kings in Mahabharat'<br />Body: 'http://new-indology.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-wheel-from-mehrgarh-to-vedas-and.html\n\nThe above blog of historian Giacomo Benedetti is about 6000 year old 6-spoked wheel and other 6-spoked wheel representations on Sindhu-Saraswati tablets and their uncanny 6-spoked wheel continuation in Vedas.\n\n&gt;"The wheel-shaped amulet inventory number MR.85.03.00.01 was collected in 1985 at the MR2 site of Mehrgarh during the excavations of the ‘Mission Archéologique de l’Indus’ (dir. Jean-François Jarrige)" \n\n&gt;The MR2 site belongs to the Period III of Mehrgarh, associated with the Chalcolithic and dated by the Wikipedia entry and by Kenoyer 4800-3500 BC. More precisely, the paper speaks of "sector X, Early Chalcolithic, end of period III, 4,500–3,600 BC." However, in the supplementary information we read: "Wheel-shaped ornament discovered by Anaick Samzun in 1985 from a surface recollection at the MR2 site. Despite the fact that the copper artefact was not discovered in its primary position, it belongs to the Early Chalcolithic period since the MR2 site dates entirely from this period."\n\n&gt;For a parallel, we can cite the Celtic use of wheel amulets (from here): \n\n&gt;&gt;Symbolic votive wheels were offered at shrines (such as in Alesia), cast in rivers (such as the Seine), buried in tombs or worn as amulets since the Middle Bronze Age. Such "wheel pendants" from the Bronze Age usually had four spokes, and are commonly identified as solar symbols or "sun cross". Artefacts parallel to the Celtic votive wheels or wheel-pendants are the so-called Zierscheiben in a Germanic context. The identification of the Sun with a wheel, or a chariot, has parallels in Germanic, Greek and Vedic mythology.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, how old are the earliest traces of real spoked wheels used for vehicles? A common answer is: Sintashta in the Russian steppe, around or slightly before 2000 BC (for instance in the detailed book of Anthony "The Horse, the Wheel, and Language"). There are graves containing impressions of spoked wheels, evidently made of wood. The same book explains that the earliest depictions of spoked wheels are later in the Near East: on cylinder seals at Kanesh (Kültepe in Turkey), the important Assyrian colony and Hittite city, around 1900 BC. Anthony used these facts to support an origin from the steppes of the chariots with spoked wheels, followed with enthusiasm by the fans of the steppes. I consider this passion for the steppes an enigmatic and irrational propensity, maybe explainable as a sort of revenge and affirmation of superiority by northern and eastern Europeans on Asians and Mediterraneans, usually regarded (with some obvious reasons) as the source of civilization. \n\n&gt;Anyway, there are some facts that are ignored in this picture. Not only the wheel-shaped amulets, already discovered in the \'80s and apparently completely neglected in the debate, but also some terracotta wheels from models of carts found in Harappan sites in Western India and in Shahr-i Shokhta, Iran, in levels dated to the 3rd millennium BC, most probably before the Sintashta graves.\n\n&gt;Not only. Kenoyer in "Wheeled Vehicles of the Indus Valley Civilization of Pakistan and India", published in 2004, remarks:\n\n&gt;&gt;At Harappa we find evidence for the use of terracotta model carts as early as 3500 BC during the Ravi Phase at Harappa [...] No carts or wheels dating to this early time period have been reported from any sites in Afghanistan or Central Asia, or even from sites such as Mehrgarh and Nausharo that are located at the edge of the Indus plain. [...] it is now possible to say that, on the basis of the currently available archaeological evidence, the development of Indus wheeled carts appears to be the result of indigenous processes occurring out in the alluvium and not the result of diffusion from mountainous regions to the west.\n\nEvidently, he did not consider the wheel-shaped amulets from Mehrgarh, but he was dealing with models of carts and terracotta wheels, which are very different from the copper amulets.\n\n&gt;But what is impressive here is that he puts the first wheeled carts in the region in the Indus valley, something completely ignored by this passage from the Wikipedia entry on the wheel:\n\n&gt;&gt;The first evidence of wheeled vehicles appears in the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia (Sumerian civilization), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe (Cucuteni-Trypillian culture), so the question of which culture originally invented the wheeled vehicle is still unsolved.    \n\n&gt;*Can we consider normal that the Indus valley is not mentioned 12 years after the article of Kenoyer? And is it normal that in the book of Anthony, published in 2007, there is no reference to the same article? Maybe yes, we can consider it normal, because South Asian archaeology is evidently out of the range of mainstream knowledge, even when the authors are important Western archaeologists like Kenoyer. I am the only one who has added references to Indian findings in the paragraph of that entry on the history of the wheel, and fortunately they have not been removed.*\n\n&gt;Anthony in his book, p.69, states that the Baden culture ceramic wagon models dated 3300-3100 BC are "the oldest well-dated three-dimensional models of wheeled vehicles", and there is no mention of the Harappan findings.\n\n&gt;An exception to this silence is the Bulgarian M. Ivanova, who, about the Maykop wheels from northern Caucasus, says in "The Black Sea and the Early Civilizations of Europe, the Near East and Asia", pp.121-2:  \n\n&gt;&gt;The remains of two wooden wheels at Novokorsunskaja allow some suppositions about the type of vehicle to which they belonged. In size, they are similar to wheels of the Catacomb culture [...] The presence of a hub suggests a vehicle with rotating wheels and a fixed axle. The vehicle from which the wheels at Novokorsunskaja originate might have been a two-axle wagon like the roughly contemporary wagon from Koldyri on the Lower Don. But it is also possible that the find from Novokorsunskaja was a two-wheeled cart. Clay models of two-wheeled carts with rotating wheels attest to the use of this type of vehicle in central Asia and the Indus valley in the late fourth millennium BC. At Altyn-depe in south Turkmenistan, such models occur in the second half of the fourth millennium (Namazga III period) and become more common in the early centuries of the third millennium. Cattle figurines with holes in the withers for attaching the yoke have been recovered at Kara-depe. Comparable models appeared in the Indus valley around 3500–3300 BC, during the Ravi-Phase of the Indus culture at Harappa (Kenoyer 2004, 90 f., Fig. 2).\n\n&gt;So, going back to Kenoyer\'s article, the American archaeologist continues speaking of the wheels found from the Early Harappan period (2800-2600 BC), 17 in number; 4 of them from Harappa have painted motifs, and one "shows radiating lines that could represent spokes". The design given in the paper (Figure 4, no.7) can suggest spokes indeed. **Kenoyer adds that the technology of wheel transport however is not well attested out of Harappa itself, and he remarks, citing Tosi 1968, that also Shahr-i Sokhta has not given wheels.** Probably, the terracotta wheel exposed in the Museum of Oriental Art in Rome shown above has been found later than Tosi\'s publication. By the way, it is remarkable that there are also zebu (Bos indicus) figurines, and since zebus were domesticated around Mehrgarh, it suggests a significant influence from the East, from the Indian subcontinent. A tendency shown also in the historical period, since the Helmand area (Arachosia) was known as White India and was more Indian than Iranian until the Muslim conquest (see here). \n\n&gt;On the other hand, Kenoyer adds (p.8):\n\n&gt;&gt;Further north in Central Asia, the first carts appear during the subsequent Namazga V period (2600-2200 BC) that corresponds to the Harappa Period in the Indus Valley, and these are four wheeled carts drawn by one or two camels and not by bullocks. Since camels were not domesticated in the Indus valley, we can assume that the use of camel carts is an indigenous process in Central Asia and that the construction of four wheeled carts in Central Asia is also a local phenomenon.\n\n&gt;About the Mature Harappan period, Kenoyer speaks of a significant increase in the number of terracotta carts and wheel fragments, and has also something to say about the reproduction of spoked wheels: \n\n&gt;&gt;The most controversial discussion revolves around the construction of spoked wheels that have been associated with the use of the horse drawn chariot and by extension, the Indo-Aryan culture. In India single examples of "spoked wheels" have been reported from the sites of Lothal, Rupar, and Mitathal, Banawali and most recently at Rakhigarhi [...] Perhaps the most convincing example of a spoked wheel comes from the site of Rahkigarhi, presumably from the Harappan levels though the excavation report has not yet been published. In this example there are eleven radiating spokes that would have provided considerable support to a light outer rim.\n\n&gt;The wheel in question is that of the photo above. Kenoyer does not speak of Bhirrana, that was excavated in the same period of the publication of his article (2003-2006). And in Puratattva no.36, of the year 2005-6, after Kenoyer\'s article, we find an article by L.S.Rao about wheels found in Bhirrana. There are several instances of wheels with painted spokes or spokes in low relief, already from the Early Mature Harappan period. I suppose the dating of this period should be around 2600 BC (the accepted beginning of the Mature Harappan), although a paper by Sarkar et al. published on Nature gives even 6.5–5 ka BP for this period. Being too far from the consensus on the periodization of the Indus-Saraswati culture, I do not dare to accept it.\n\n&gt;However, we have a confirmation that spoked wheels were well known in Mature Harappan India. L.S.Rao, who apparently did not know Kenoyer\'s article (he cites only a 1998 book of him), remarks that they have not been found in the Indus valley, but we have seen that an example was already in an Early Harappan level of Harappa, and we can add the spoked wheel from Shahr-i Sokhta contemporary with Mature Harappan. Mehrgarh\'s amulets seem a bit too early, also compared with the earliest cart models from Harappa (3500 BC). However, 3600 BC as the lowest limit of the Chalcolithic level of the amulets is not so far from it, but very far from the first attestations of a terracotta wheel with spokes (after 2800 BC, Early Harappan). Moreover, those copper objects are quite different from the terracotta wheels, and they can also be pure symbols. But why in that shape, and symbols of what? We can remark that they have six spokes. What can be the meaning of that number? \n\n&gt;If you search for numerical symbolism in ancient India, the best place is the hymn RV I.164. There we read in st.11-12:\n\ndvādaśāraṃ nahi tajjarāya varvarti cakraṃ pari dyāṃ ṛtasya | ā putrā agne mithunāso atra sapta śatāni viṃśatiśca tasthuḥ || pañcapādaṃ pitaraṃ dvādaśākṛtiṃ diva āhuḥ pare ardhe purīṣiṇam | atheme anya upare vicakṣaṇaṃ saptacakre ṣaḷara āhur arpitam ||\n\n&gt;So translated by Jamison and Brereton (see here): 11. Twelve-spoked, the wheel of truth [=the Sun] ever rolls around heaven—yet not to old age. Upon it, o Agni, stand seven hundred twenty sons in pairs [=the nights and days of the year]. 12. They speak of the father [=the Moon] with five feet [=the seasons] and twelve forms [=the months], the overflowing one in the upper half of heaven. But these others speak of the far-gazing one [=the Sun] in the nearer (half) fixed on (the chariot) with seven wheels [=the Sun, Moon, and visible planets] and six spokes [=the seasons, in a different reckoning].\n\n&gt; The word ṣaḷ-ara means \'having six spokes\' and it is the Rigvedic equivalent of ṣaḍ-ara, found in a repetition of st.12 placed in AV (Śaunaka recension) 9.9.12 before a repetition of st.11 (see here for the translation). The same stanza 12 is cited in the Atharvavedic Praśna Upaniṣad, commented by Śaṃkara, who recognized the symbolism of the year and seasons. About ṣaḍara, he glossed with the compound ṣaḍ-ṛtu-mat- \'having six seasons\'.\n\nNow, in Harappan seals we find a sort of spoked wheel, regularly with six spokes:\n\n&gt;The similarity of shape with Mehrgarh\'s amulets is remarkable, and the fact that it is placed over the heroic scene on the convex tablet shows its strong symbolic character, probably with a solar meaning as in the Vedic hymn.\nAlso in historical times, the wheel of Viṣṇu, called Sudarśana-cakra, is often described as having six spokes, symbolizing again the six seasons (see e.g. here).\n\n&gt;Thus, we would have again a striking instance of cultural continuity, this time from Chalcolithic Mehrgarh to historical India through the Harappan age. \n_______________________________________\n\n\nAnu is a Vedic Sanskrit term for one of the 5 major clans in the Rigveda, RV 1.108.8, RV 8.10.5 (both times listed together with the Druhyu) and, much later also in the Mahabharata.[6] In the late Vedic period, one of the Anu kings, King Anga, is mentioned as a "chakravarti" (AB 8.22)\n\nBharatas - The Bharatas are an Aryan clan mentioned in the Rigveda, especially in Mandala 3 attributed to the Bharata sage Vishvamitra and in and Mandala 7.[10] Bharatá is also used as a name of Agni (literally, "to be maintained", viz. the fire having to be kept alive by the care of men), and as a name of Rudra in RV 2.36.8. In one of the "river hymns" RV 3.33, the entire Bharata clan is described as crossing over, with their chariots and wagons, at the confluence of the Vipash (Beas) and Shutudri (Satlej). Hymns by Vasistha in Mandala 7 (7.18 etc.) mention the Bharatas as the protagonists in the Battle of the Ten Kings, where they are on the winning side. They appear to have been successful in the early power-struggles between the various Aryan and non-Aryan clans so that they continue to dominate in post-Rigvedic texts, and later in the (Epic) tradition, the Mahābhārata, the eponymous ancestor becomes Bharata Chakravartin, conqueror of \'all of India\', and his clan and kingdom is called Bhārata. "Bhārata" today is the official name of the Republic of India\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rigvedic_tribes\n\nThe Chakra finds mention in the Rigveda as a symbol of Vishnu, and as the wheel of time,[6] and in the Itihasas.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hathyogi31/status/1301112164174888960/photo/1\n\nRigveda also refers to the wheel of time: The Rig Veda hymn 48 in book 1:\n\ndvâdaśa pradháyaś cakrám ékaṃ / trîṇi nábhyāni ká u tác ciketa\n\ntásmin sākáṃ triśatâ ná śaṅkávo / ‘rpitâḥ ṣaṣṭír ná calācalâsaḥ\n\nदवादश परधयश्चक्रमेकं तरीणि नभ्यानि क उ तच्चिकेत |\n\nतस्मिन साकं तरिशता न शङकवो.अर्पिताः षष्टिर्न चलाचलासः ||\n\n“Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty, which in nowise can be loosened.”\n\nhttps://pragyata.com/the-cosmic-wheel/\n\nRg Veda also refers to the cosmos as a wheel:\n\nSeven to the one-wheeled chariot yoke the Courser; bearing seven names the single Courser draws it. Three-naved the wheel is, sound and undecaying, whereon are resting all these worlds of being. The seven [priests] who on the seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward. Seven Sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the names of the seven Cows are treasured. Who hath beheld him as he [Sun/Agni] sprang to being, seen how the boneless One [spirit] supports the bony [body]? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who will approach the one who knows, to ask this?\n\n— Rigveda 1.164.2 - 1.164.4, [91]\n\nthe entire hymn is a riddle that paints a ritual as well as the sun, moon, earth, three seasons, the transitory nature of living beings, the passage of time and spirit.[89][90] "seven" multiple times, which in the context of other chapters of Rigveda have been interpreted as referring to both seven priests at a seven constellations in the sky,\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya#Historical_development\n\nIn the Mahabharatha, Krishna, identified with Vishnu, uses it as a weapon. For example, he beheads Shishupala with the Sudarshana Chakra at the Rajasuya yagna of Emperor Yudhishthira. He also uses it during the 14th day of the Mahabharata War to perplex Duryodhana by summoning Jayadratha in front of Arjuna by hiding the Sun with his chakra. In the end, the Kauravas get fooled and thus Arjuna avenges the death of his son.\n\nAccording to the Valmiki Ramayana, Purushottama (Vishnu) killed a Danava named Hayagriva on top of a mountain named Chakravana constructed by Vishvakarma and took away a Chakra i.e. the Sudarshana Chakra from him.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Aabhas24/status/1087158767311974400/photo/2\n\nhttp://www.sutrajournal.com/asko-parpola-on-the-roots-of-hinduism-by-vikram-zutshi\n\nhttps://www.harappa.com/script/parpola6.html\n\nhttps://www.harappa.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Kenoyer2004_Wheeled%20Vehicles%20of%20the%20Indus%20Valley%20Civilizatio.pdf'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p6sndk'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p6sndk/while_wheel_on_our_national_flag_is_called_ashoka/</li>

It was founded on April 2, 2017 by [Markandey Katju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markandey_Katju), a former Justice of the Supreme Court of India, who serves as the patron of the association.\n\n&gt;The Indian Reunification Association (IRA) advocates for the peaceful reunification of India with what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh, land that was separated in 1947 through the partition of our sacred nation. We believe that the partition was a result of hatred artificially created by British imperialists in order to maintain rule over India. This “divide and rule” policy aimed at separating Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who had lived in India together for centuries, because in the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, the British saw these people of different creeds and castes united to overthrow their tyrannical imperialist rule in India. While many freedom fighters understood this British connivance, other Indian politicians fell into the trap of the British, to divide our country. The effects of the partition of India in 1947 trickle down to this day, causing the countries of the Indian subcontinent to spend exorbitant amounts of money on their militaries, to further the artificial hatred that was created by their colonial rulers--these valuable resources could instead be used to better the lives of our people. Imperial powers, which we aimed to overthrow in the past, continue to benefit from the partition, with India and Pakistan using large percentages of their budget to purchase weapons from them. A reunited India would come about after we the people of the subcontinent realize that we were made puppets for the gain of foreign rulers. A united India would emerge as an economic powerhouse on the global scale, with our financial resources being spent on developing our industries and infrastructure, rather than on weapons to harm people of the same blood who lived together in harmony, spoke the same languages, and shared the same homes for over a millennium.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian\\_Reunification\\_Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Reunification_Association)\n\n[https://indianreunificationassociation.weebly.com/](https://indianreunificationassociation.weebly.com/)'<br />Author: 'bourgeoisiewoke'  id: 'p6l6u6'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p6l6u6/the_indian_reunification_association/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'US most trusted power, China most distrusted: Survey of young Indians'<br />Body: ' \n\nAn overwhelming eighty per cent of young people in India who participated in a recent survey believed the government should focus on improving the economy of the country. The pandemic is also a major cause of concern for young people in the country, who seem to be also highly troubled by terrorism, which they view as one of the top key foreign policy challenges.\n\nThese are some of the findings from a new survey by the Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation. Two thousand young people in the age group of 18-35 years from 14 cities were interviewed for this survey released by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Independence Day.\n\nThe purpose of the survey is to get an understanding about the foreign policy issues that matter most for young Indians and to get a grip on which areas young people want the government to focus their attention on. There are not many studies on the views of young people in India on foreign policy, said media reports\n\nThe ORF website meanwhile stated that the survey is meant to evaluate the views of India’s urban youth on the government’s foreign policy, their assessment of emerging foreign policy challenges and India’s ties with regional and global powers.\n\nThe top foreign policy concerns that seem to dominate the minds of Indian youth are the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorism, cyber-security and the Ladakh stand-off with China, said a Times of India report quoting the survey results. Nearly half the youth surveyed also wanted the government to tackle climate change as a major priority.\n\nBorder conflicts with China are a big concern for nearly 52 per cent of young people as compared to 49 per cent worried about border conflicts with Pakistan. However, they don’t believe the government should give priority to resolving differences with China or Pakistan over setting the economy right (80 per cent), fighting terrorism (73 per cent) or even improving ties with the US (56 per cent). Building bridges and settling differences with China and Pakistan are not so much a priority for young Indians.\n\nAccording to the TOI report, 68 per cent of the respondents regarded Sri Lanka as India’s most trusted neighbour. Though, India’s relations with Sri Lanka are no longer as trust-worthy after China opened a front against India through Sri Lanka and also due to the omnipresent issue of the Tamils on the island. Bhutan, which is India’s staunchest ally, comes a distant third and is lower than Nepal. Pakistan comes at the lowest with a 10 per cent trust rankings.\n\nOver 77 per cent of the young people surveyed seem to be rooting for the USA as the most trusted global power, a similar 77 per cent distrusted China the most. But, who will partner India in the years ahead? It was Quad, Russia and Europe in that order, added the TOI report. Young people also supported the government’s decision on Quad.\n\n**Young people’s nod to Indian government’s decisions**\n\nInterestingly, by and large, young people seem to be in sync with the Modi’s government’s decisions. The government’s decision to ban Chinese apps had the approval of 86 per cent of the young people interviewed, Balakot air strike got the nod of about 68 per cent of the group, while the topic of India throwing its weight behind the Quad too was welcomed by 68 per cent.\n\nWhat may play a role in political decisions in the future is that 74 per cent of the young people favour the government’s decision to crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n**No to China**\n\nYoung people however advocated that India should abandon the idea of non-alignment and join hands with the USA in the eventuality of rising Indo-China tensions. The respondents were anxious about Chinese military and economic superiority and its interference in India’s neighbourhood. They fear war would break out between India and China.\n\nThough young people had ideas about India’s permanent membership of the UNSC, and knew about the World Trade organisation, nearly two-thirds were clueless about the non-aligned movement.\n\nThe TOI quoted the study to state that there is also low awareness about more recent platforms and forums such as Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), SAARC, Group of 20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.'<br />Author: 'Muscle_Nerd11'  id: 'p6jjid'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p6jjid/us_most_trusted_power_china_most_distrusted/</li>

(Reuters)\nIn the wake of the prevailing situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban have seized power, India has introduced a new category of e-visa for Afghan nationals to fast-track their applications for entry into India. These visas will be valid for six months only and will be granted only after security clearance, sources said.\n\n“MHA reviews visa provisions in view of the current situation in Afghanistan. A new category of electronic visa called “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” introduced to fast-track visa applications for entry into India,” a statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Tuesday.\n\n\nSources said the visa is being granted to facilitate the stay of Afghan nationals fleeing Afghanistan for **six months** in India. There is no clarity yet on what will happen after this validity period expires. India does not have a refugee policy and grants shelter to foreigners facing persecution in their countries on a case-to-case basis.\n\n\n“Such a visa may be granted only with single entry and for the specific duration taking into account the purpose of visit. If the visa is granted for a period of stay exceeding 180 days, the foreigner will have to register himself/ herself with the FRRO/ FRO concerned within 14 days of arrival. **This visa will be non-extendable and non-convertible to any other type of visa,”** the MHA policy document on X-Misc visa says."<br />Author: 'itisverynice'  id: 'p66yy0'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p66yy0/clarification_on_those_emergency_visas_for_afghans/</li>

Even after they captured Kabul, the Taliban declined issuing any agenda on how they intended to set up a representative government or foster economic development. For the Taliban to insist upon international recognition when there was no clearly demarcated government only increased the international community's doubts about their ability to govern. **The spokesman of the Kabul Shura, Sher** **Mohammed Stanakzai, a relatively suave English-speaking Ghilzai Taliban from Logar province who had trained in India as a policeman, was the Taliban conduit for the UN aid agencies and the foreign media**. However it quickly became apparent that Stanakzai had no real power and did not even have direct access to Mullah Omar in order to convey messages and receive an answer. As a consequence his job became meaningless as aid agencies never knew if their messages were even reaching Omar. \n\nExcerpt from book **Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, Second Edition**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sher\\_Mohammad\\_Abbas\\_Stanikzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sher_Mohammad_Abbas_Stanikzai)"<br />Author: 'bourgeoisiewoke'  id: 'p5n8cy'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p5n8cy/sher_mohammed_stanakzai_the_current_head_of/</li>

US runs away from every Fight it starts. Taliban will be stronger than ever bcoz their Victory will establish their belief that We Have Defeated Two Super Powers With our Faith(Islam), that’s Real Danger.”\n@Vikram_Sood in 2019**\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vaibhavUP65/status/1426987834922074114\n\n\nI'll just leave this 9.5 year old tweet of mine out here. Mind you, this was amongst the first 50 or 100 tweets of mine when I joined this medium.\n\nQuran protests in Afg. Yanks will never get the honorable exit that they r looking for.Guess now they realize they attckd the wrong country!\n\nSo let me now try and make sense of what MIGHT happen next.\nMind you, no one can say for sure how the Afghan cookie will crumble this time round. So at best, I'll offer my own guesses on the same.\n\nSince the US has lost the two decade long war, it might be fair to start by asking who is it that has actually WON it?\nA mighty difficult question, no?\n\nWhich brings me to the question whether it is Pakistan that has won this war.\nWell, they do come close to being the ones who have 'won'. The simple reason for this being that they will get yet another opportunity to place yet another friendly regime in Afghanistan.\n\nBut moving on to what might happen next, I'd say the decade of the 90s does offer a template of some sorts. Even though there are newer stakeholders this time round, the principal actors remain unchanged - Taliban and Pakistan Army.\n\nWhy principal actors?\nWell, I'll just leave this tweet here without any further comment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CestMoiz/status/1234369257250656256\n\nRemember the cruise missiles that Bill Clinton sent cruising via Pakistan into Afghanistan to target Osama bin Laden after the Tanzania and Kenya embassy bombings?\nAmongst those killed were LeT terrorists as well as a number of ISI personnel.\n\nWell, after Kabul fell in the mid 90s, came a wave of terror attacks around the world, mostly on American targets, ending up ultimately with the 9/11 bombings that brought the US back into the region with Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nQ: What is the one common factor between the Soviet and the US withdrawal from Afghanistan?\nA: BOTH were accomplished by a combination of American money sent into Pakistan and Pakistan sponsored + Pakistan based 'enemy'!\n\n\nOf course, India too witnessed a surge of terror attacks in Kashmir as well as outside in rest of the country as a cocky Pakistan, drunk on the recent 'victory' in Afg, channelized part of the terror machine towards us.\n\n#I remember reading newspapers during college days and for some time after that in the 90s, talking about Afghans and even Somalis fighting in Kashmir. At that time I couldn't really fathom the reason why. But it became amply clear later on as I read more into the subject.\n\n#And then with the US finally back in Afghanistan, came the J&amp;K Assembly bombing, the Parliament attack, the Kaluchak Massacre, countless bombings in the hinterland and finally the 26/11 attacks.\nPart of the reason why India didn't take overt military action against Pakistan after the Parliament, the Kaluchak and the 26/11 attacks was thought to be the presence of Americans in Afg and how diverting Packie military away from 'helping' them might impact their own war.\nWell, the results are there for all to see.\n\nWhat will happen now?\n\nThe euphoria of a 'victory' in Afghanistan is likely to result in a terror attack or two on India in the coming days and months. But then, what comes back towards them in the aftermath is perhaps a topic for another thread some day. However, I am willing to bet that sovereign  Indian territory stands a good chance at expanding by whatever degree it does, in case of a future attempt at being a bit too clever by the Brown Panted ones.\nBut then, it is just a personal opinion!\n\nSo back to Afg, reports just coming in that President Ghani has made good his escape. A wise decision, I'd say, especially since his so called 'ally' too has run away, leaving him alone.\n\nWhat comes next in Afg is a vacuum.\nWhy a vacuum, when the Taliban are likely to establish a govt, you ask?\nWell, because they cannot sustain an independent country based merely on terror and drug trade. They couldn't do so in the 90s, and they can't do so now.\n\nWho might try &amp; fill it up this time, is a question being asked far and wide.\nChina seems to be the obvious 'winner' in this debate, &amp; for good reason too. A hubristic, self-anointed 'Chairman for Life' who has no option but to appear 'strong' rules China!\n\nAdd to that the fact that the Chinese have been eyeing the seemingly HUGE natural resources deposits in Afghanistan AND have the money power to make their play, makes them a viable alternative to fill in the vacuum.\n\nAdd to that the fact that they already have a direct land route via Gilgit-Baltistan to Afg, and this makes all the more sense.\nIf fact the bomb attack on Chinese workers in Dasu in NW Pakistan too might have been an initial salvo in trying to lay down rules of 'engagement' by  Packies and their Talibani 'friends', for all I care.\nBut then, how might this affect India, is the question that bugs me at times.\nWell, the answer that I am coming round to, is that it hardly has any material effect on India!\n\nIn fact, it will divert Packie energies away from own borders for the near future atleast, as they try to get the game to settle down to their advantage before looking elsewhere.\nIt was easy in the 90s since Russia and China had absolutely no role to play.\n\nBut now, the USA, though having run away from the immediate battlefield, is unlikely to let the new benefactors of Taliban have an easy run, especially if they are the ones that bow to a certain Mr Xi.\n\nThis possibility of a shadow war leads me further to a conspiracy theory.\nFeel free to dismiss it as a figment of my imagination, but I'll still say it out loud here because .. well .. I can!\n\n#What are the odds that the sheer quantum of fully serviceable American military equipment falling into the hands of the Taliban isn't merely a coincidence, but instead, a ploy to make things more difficult for the next superpower that tries its luck in Afghanistan?\n\nThe marriage between Taliban and Pakistan is merely a marriage of convenience, for neither own the Afghan Nation that never wanted to recognize Pakistan in its current form as far back as 1947!\n\nQ: Which was the ONLY country to vote against the inclusion of #Pakistan in the UN in 1947?\nA: Afghanistan\n\nMind you, acrimony that Afghans feel towards Paakis goes beyond mere govt levels. It is a feeling that runs throughout much of the Afg population who know for a fact that Paaki meddling in search for 'strategic depth' is the biggest reason for their misery\n\nTo that end, I'd rather say that Afghanistan is indeed a strategic depth .. but for India!\nYup, feel free to read that again.\nAn Afg that sucks in Packie energies and resources is always good for us. It will continue to be so for atleast another year or so, if not more.\n\nOf course, there will be some spillover across the LoC into India .. perhaps even in the hinterland. But then, all that will serve to do is to give another reason for the Indian military to overtly punish Pakistan as has been the trend lately.\n\nBut one thing is for sure - it is China that is going to have another front active, in addition to the Himalayan front and the South China Sea / Taiwan fronts!\n\nTHAT is something which needs to be looked out for.\nTHAT is something that I am eagerly awaiting to see happen &amp; then to see how things progress from thereon.\nTHAT is something which I wish to see Packies try to turn into their favour with both their baaps as I mentioned earlier!\n\nTHIS is what the game is in the medium to long run in the days, weeks, months and years to come, as the wheels of history churn towards another turning. And as they say, wheels of history require blood to give them motion.\nThus far it was American blood.\nWill it be Chinese next?\n\nBut then, one more thing that I don't see may folks discuss is the fact that aside from the fact that the US is out of one war, this also means that the next war is just a matter of time, given their history!\nTweeted this more than two years back!\n\n&gt;We've mostly been seeing the US withdrawal from Afghanistan as merely a withdrawal.\nI wonder how many might be seeing as a re-mustering of troops for application elsewhere ..\n\n\nOh, btw, these beautiful visuals of the Chinooks that I tweeted earlier in this thread just led me to thinking where will these Chinooks go after evacuating the Americans .. Will they not go across the Durand Line into Pakistan?\n\nEspecially since American planes targetting Taliban continue to freely fly over Pakistani airspace even today?\n\nBtw, those who are aware of the Kunduz Airlift might also want to draw some parallels with this currently underway evacuation of American personnel from Afghanistan!\nYup, give it a thought and you might find some newer insights as well!\n\nAs far as India goes, people getting alarmed at what might happen to us now, may want to relax a bit because what is fated, must be endured, but all I'll offer is that we've endured much worse at a time when we were much weaker and much isolated and yet we lived to tell our tale.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CestMoiz/status/1426926613695016962"<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p5hoe3'<br />Score:125<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p5hoe3/im_glad_that_we_have_modiji_at_the_helm_it_is_a/</li>

As economical it seems it is also safe from any kind of risk that Pakistan/China can detonate It which roams around the Aircraft carriers and there is little to no maintenance costs present. \n\nIn my view we should develop island on [these two spots.](https://i.ibb.co/710dc3D/IMG-20210816-012401.jpg) orange spot will keep China's presence in-check in both Sri Lanka and maldives and purple spot is straight near Karachi so Pakistan will refrain from making any bustle and we can also keep Gwadar port in-check.\n\nInstead we need to invest more on destroyers, frigates and Corvettes both in the term of quantity and quality. We should upgrade the missile, electronics and defense systems of our current destroyers, frigates, Corvettes.\n\nAny insight and rectification is welcome."<br />Author: 'king_bardock'  id: 'p50tih'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p50tih/my_thoughts_on_ins_vishal/</li>

Democracy cannot be set up in Afghanistan but can peace be negotiated this way?\n\nThis would have to be done by multiple countries by forming an alliance or something, like USA, Europe, Japan and Russia which is beneficial for them because that would put a major set back for China given that they have agreed to recognise Taliban and make it powerless. This would be great for India because Pakistan will be left fighting for their own border instead of our border. China and Pakistan will not able to work together so more pressure on Pakistan which also means a loss to China's influence on India. Pakistan and China are a pain in the ass to other countries too, US, UK and European countries have admitted this.\n\nI can't say what the Taliban wants to do with Afghanistan but we know they would love to get their border back, which was given to Pakistan by the British and it should be something that should be considered as a negotiable option. The pashtuns would want to reunite with their brotherhood, home land and to an islamic rule. \n\nIf Taliban goes back to its primitive terrorist activities, I'm sure they would be taken over for another 20 years and it's going to be a lot more easier this time because there are multiple countries they should have complied with, but this time Pakistan won't be harbouring anymore Talibanis or other terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda because they hate eachother because of the border dispute. \n\nIf Taliban can be recognised as a legitimate government, I think this would be possible.

This is no disrespect to our army, but why can't we question such practices? Why can't we have an Indian way of discipline, coordination etc.? Didn't ancient Indian armies have a way to practice coordination and discipline?

      <li>Title::: "BSNL is injecting code on to your browsers, and here's what it does."<br />Body: ' 📷\n\nDonate to Support Us\n\nTl;dr\n\nWe wrote to BSNL about the code injections that continue to persist on their network. In our representation, we highlighted the inadequacy of their past responses to our earlier representations and RTIs, and outlined some key questions that need to be addressed by BSNL.\n\nBackground\n\nIn May 2019, we had sent a[ **representation to BSNL regarding the code injections**](https://internetfreedom.in/venom-venom-venom-bsnl-engaging-in-code-injections/), explaining how these code injections were illegal under several legal frameworks such as the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Cellular Media Telephone Services Agreement signed by BSNL. Having received no response, we went ahead with our a [**three-pronged action approach**](https://internetfreedom.in/weve-been-left-on-read/), which included:\n\n1. Filing an RTI with BSNL\n2. Filing an RTI with and writing a complaint to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT)\n3. Filing an incident report with CERT-IN\n\nSubsequently, while we did not receive a response from the DoT and CERT-In to our complaints, [**we received responses to the RTIs**](https://internetfreedom.in/bsnls-code-of-misconduct/) filed with BSNL and the DoT. While BSNL acknowledged the existence of these injections, they claimed that there was no malware in the code.\n\nWe then [**received further replies to our RTIs,**](https://internetfreedom.in/bsnls-claim-we-have-dnd-mechanisms/) in which BSNL stated that:\n\n* Providing \xa0information on BSNLs engagement in the insertion of browser injections or code injections would violate \'commercial confidence\' and harm BSNL\'s competitive position.\n* They rely on such activities to communicate with customers on available offers and useful information like Parental Control Guidelines.\n* If they receive complaints via mails, they enable their \'DND\' mechanism after confirming and collecting User Ids.\n\nAdditionally, we had [**filed an incident report with CERT-IN**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11FXCBEPN7c8orj5O6B8uMHDQUak3k7Tp/view) to which we had received no response. However, an [**RTI reply confirmed that CERT-IN had written to BSNL**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OCt_kdH60f3qCqEEiJI3JtxDTjly7D1Q/view), indicating that at the very least some action had been initiated.\n\nSadly, despite all this huffing and puffing, code injections continue to happen. Thus, based on the large number of complaints we have received, we decided to take a look at the technical aspects of this issue, and inspect the code that is being generated.\n\nA closer look at the code\n\nWe were able to analyse some of the code that is being injected. Consider the extract below (a larger extract can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10JmPSJvmsYaubHVtrwUiC0ytDicRHBjk/view?usp=sharing)).\n\n📷\n\nThe script seems to indicate that a host of information is being shared, presumably with a third party advertiser, including not only details about the website being visited, but also information that could potentially identify the user. For example, the user’s IP address is being shared, while the variable subscriberId would indicate that some sort of alphanumeric identifier (that would presumably be unique to a user) is also being shared. Now, generally, when user data is shared with advertisers, it is done so in an aggregated manner that does not allow the advertiser to directly see who these users are. However, on the basis of the code above, it would seem like BSNL is sharing non-aggregated browsing data directly!\n\nFurthermore, based on our conversations with security researchers and users, we have identified some other details about these code injections:\n\n* **Session based injection:** Broadly, these injections seem to happen at the beginning of each session (basically, they repeat after approximately an hour or so). Moreover, this frequency does not seem to change even if you switch browsers. For example, suppose you start a browsing session at 7 PM on Mozilla and encounter the injected adware. Next, at 7:50 PM, you switch to Chrome. Then the next ad you will see will appear at 8 PM (not at 7:50 PM at the start of the session). This means that it is likely that some sort of cookie is being stored locally on your computer.\n* **Code on BSNL server:** \xa0As we have confirmed, this is not a bug, it\'s a feature - the code that is being injected is indeed hosted on BSNL servers! One of the researchers we spoke to even mentioned that some of the ads being served have previously been identified as malware.\n* **Adware made to look like an error page:** One of the people we spoke to mentioned that when they clicked on one of the websites from which the ad seems to originate, they were led to a page which prima facie looked like a error page (à la “this web page is not available”) but was in fact a page that was only designed to look like one i.e. someone purposely designed the web page in that manner.\n\n**Our Recommendations**\n\nBSNL’s code injections have been an issue from [**as long ago as 2015**](https://broadbandforum.co/threads/bsnl-is-inserting-ads-in-websites-sending-their-users-to-malware-sites-through-malware-code-injection.169151/) (if not even before), and yet even today they continue to happen. Thus, we have the following suggestions for BSNL:\n\n1. **End the tyranny of defaults:** In the event that BSNL is going to continue with such egregious impingements upon the rights of users, such ‘advertising services’ (if they can be called that), must be made opt-in i.e. users must provide explicit consent for such services.\n2. **Clarity in implementation:** BSNL needs to come out with a clear response as to how the decision to implement these services was arrived upon. Details about any agreements signed for such purposes also need to be provided. Furthermore, we have asked BSNL to provide clarity on what percentage of their annual revenue is being derived from these services.\n3. **Transparency on security:** Given the potential threat of malvertising, through malicious code being injected through seemingly harmless ads, BSNL needs to provide a clear outline of all the security practices they are following to ensure that compromised code is not being injected into users’ browsers.\n\n*This is an issue that we have been tracking for some time, and we understand the pain of BSNL users. Thus, in the near future, we will be ramping up our efforts to hold BSNL accountable, including \xa0releasing a model complaint that users can send to BSNL and the Department of Telecommunications.

Is this love of mine a blind sentiment Spurning reason’s guidance? Far from it! I love India Because it was there I first learned To love God, and all things beautiful.  Some people counsel all to seize the fickle dewdrop of Life As it slips down the lotus leaf of time; They cry, “Live well today: tomorrow we die!” Some others base their stubborn hopes On keeping their bodies always well. India, however, taught me to love above all The soul of deathless beauty within man’s fragile form. That serves a high purpose, India taught me, Which lasts after everything dies. Her sages taught that one should seek the Self Beyond the ash heaps of discarded bodies, Beyond the brief, ephemeral incarnations we live Decked out in panoplies of ignorance!  Through many a land, Secure in power and plenty, efficiently sustained by science, My soul, whether garbed in Oriental or Occidental body, Traveled far and wide o’er the earth. Ever stumblingly it sought itself. At last in India was its quest fulfilled.  If mortal fires razed all Indian homes, And desiccated her paddy fields, Yet would I rather sleep on that dust, dreaming eternity, Than sit on a proud throne amid royal pomp. O, India! I would starve in your poor villages In preference to entertaining kings in marble mansions! Invasions have swept over India’s wasted lands, Proud conquerors have strutted their proud victories: Scoffing at all they saw, They commanded abject homage. Yet has the soul of India been unconquered by any tyrant. Her independent soul has stood firm: Never will she lose her inner freedom! Her defending soldiers are her saints and rishis Who routed ignorance with calm wisdom, Universal understanding, And ever‐clear perception of the truth. The posturing puppets sent by foreign governments To impose new ways of action, thought, belief— Marauders bearing hatred, prejudice, and country’s pride— Could never weaken the inspiration God implanted in her soil, Inspiring ever a vision of oneness, universality, and brotherhood Among all children of our One Father equally. My Western brothers, with material might, have overwhelmed my land: Now loudly blow your conchs, all! India soon will launch a new, return invasion; Its weapons will consist of kindness, truth, and love! Its ancient wisdom will amaze the West—the whole world. Better I love thee, O my India, Than Heaven or Acadia, And thy love I will share With every brother‐nation that accepts my offering. God made the earth, but man made its confining countries With their fancy‐frozen boundaries. Love, however, imported from Infinity, Will inspire equally all true souls, everywhere. My India’s borderland embraces the whole world!  Hail, Thou mother of religions, lotus, scenic beauties, and great sages! Thy doors are open wide to welcome God’s true sons from every corner of the earth, Where Ganges, floods, Himalayan caves, and men dream God. I am hallowed; my body touched that sod! \n\n- শ্রী Yogananda পরমহংস[Sri Paramhansa Yogananda with Anandamayi Ma](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Paramahansa-Yogananda-with-Anandamayi-Ma.jpg)'<br />Author: 'ContextSwitchKiller'  id: 'p4f3ps'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p4f3ps/my_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Change in India's perspective"<br />Body: "From 10 years ago to now there has been a massive change in the way people in India think. Back in 2010, the general idea was that *India and Pakistan are two nations with the same people, brothers divided by borders, hatred and politicians.* \n\nNow the general idea is that *Hell no. That's a terrorist state whose sole purpose is to harm India and we should have nothing to do with them. We should be better than them.* \n\nThis I believe is progress. 14th August isn't the Independence Day for Pakistan, but the day when India was destined to decades of torture and terrorism from Pakistan. It is a tragic day, absolutely not a day to celebrate. Pakistan has no cohesion as a country except for their religion which too has been bastardized to the point that no one in the middle east identifies with Pakistan as one of their own in terms of religiosity. \n\nAlways remember that Pakistan thrived for so long only because the west decided it was necessary to hold up a country against a democratic but Soviet Aligned India. India on the other hand has not harmed a single country and has never held Cold War Politics against any country. We continued play by every single rule in the rule book even at the cost of great peril to our own citizens and soldiers. \n\nOver the years, India's stability, India's integrity and her growth has put her in close relations with the EU and even the US isn't particularly wary of India anymore. The technological investments, the economic cooperation with the west has led to a much better prospect for India despite India never allying with them, while Pakistan despite being an ally of the west was and is the most problematic ally they never deserved to have. \n\nGood days lie ahead in terms of our economy and our success as a country. Regardless of whoever comes as our prime minister, our democratic process and the will of our people will continue to cause industrialization and growth at neck breaking pace. \n\nAnd no Pakistan can halt it even if they gather the entire world to support them. India for the first time is a self respecting billion people that prioritize India over all else. Our successes are ours. Our failures are ours. Our problems are ours to solve. Our social issues are ours to correct. Let us solve them together and make our country far more progressive than ever before.

      <li>Title::: 'What do we think about academics promoting Indology and defending Indian culture?'<br />Body: 'I was reading the Wikipedia entry on Rajiv Malhotra and his introduction says he "promotes a Hindutva view on Indic cultures", and cites this for reference : https://scroll.in/article/740814/plagiarism-row-how-rajiv-malhotra-became-the-ayn-rand-of-internet-hindutva\n\nHad some thoughts I would like to share and hear your opinions about. I hope this is not seen as some Hindu-Muslim, Left-Right perspective..\n\n----------------------\nWhile I have not been a very religious person, I can see for myself the remarkably different approaches to life, culture, thought and civilization between Indian thought and Western thought. This brought me to various communities of reddit in search for other people who can recognise the same. Just some context- As an urban bred Indian,  this was an active choice for me where being Indian or patriotic or Hindu (as they are often mixed up in left leaning conversations on social media) are entirely mine and not imposed by some Conservative social background or upbringing.\n\nOne of the things that really struck me was how little I knew about philosophical , scientific, and other academic ideas that originated on our subcontinent. I have been making continuous efforts to educate myself in this. During this process,  I came across the works of people such as Rajiv Malhotra which were remarkable to me, among others. \n\nWhat I observe is while Indians are present across academic fields in all walks of life, they are working in Western constructs and the academic study of Indian knowledge is still seen as something  mythical, something to be debunked, pagan etc. There is of course an increasing presence of terms like post colonial, subaltern, post Western etc. But consider for example Philosophy studies. The extremely evolved ecosystem of English language literature available for every Western school of thought has made it so popular that any decently westernised Indian can make memes about Hegel and Camus and Neitzche. Reaching that point may be very far off (hopefully we get there some time), but we are nowhere near a basic level of awareness with its Indian counterparts.\n\nOf course this is not some easy problem that gets solved by just educating people about Indian origin concepts - I believe it is a whole ecosystem of Academic thought and authority, subsequent influence, adaption as it trickles into common parlance, acceptance, promotion in pop culture (aka top rated films and movies we can have endless thought pieces about). \n\nIn face of all of this, I think people like Rajiv Malhotra and similar organisations are doing a very important task in creating a new image for Indian academic presence.

      <li>Title::: "A historical analysis of the Afghan state's role in the Indian sub-continent and potential geo-pol implications"<br />Body: ' Warning: Long post\n\n**Afghanistan and the world: an inseparable history of conflict**\n\nThe region and peoples that live in the current state of Afghanistan have been playing a very unique role in the Indian subcontinent for almost 1000 years.\n\nAfghans live in a unique country. Its climate is extremely inhospitable with majority of the land experiencing either hot or cold desert conditions. Agriculture and industry has therefore been very hard to pursue given these conditions. However sitting at the "center of Asia" - and tempered by the harsh conditions, the warlike people of the country have often "struck out" throughout their history and have taken up a predatory role - bandits looting caravans, tribes breaking out of their desolate mountains to raid cities and in fact, for long tracts of their history - conquerors and rulers of surrounding lands. If I was to use an analogy, the wolf comes to mind.\n\nA good source to get a bird\'s eye view of their domination as conquerors can be had by eyeballing this page - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_wars\\_involving\\_Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Afghanistan)\n\nIf I were to chronologically look at tracts of Afghan history of the past 1000 years, it is deeply , I see it as -\n\n1000-1215 AD: Ghurids. Orignally Buddhists, post conversion to Islam and consolidating the Afghans they ruled over a massive kingdom covering modern day Pakistan and most of North and Eastern India.\n\n1290-1325 AD: Khalji. Post a period of decline and confusion post Ghurid decline and domination by Iranian Khwarezmids, Khaljis ruled over modern day Pakistan and large tracts of North, West and Southern India.\n\n1325-1525 AD: this was a period where Afghanistan was chewed up a lot by the Mongols and mostly kept within hemmed within the Timurid empire.\n\n1525-1738: Mughals. Afghanistan was splintered into 3 parts the western part being ruled by Iranian Safavids, Northern by the Mongol Khanates and Eastern by the Mughals. Afghans did very well under the Mughals - Babur more or less considered Kabul as his home and Afghan soldiers and administrators were key in ruling the entirety of the subcontinent, throughout its length.\n\n1747-1823: Durranis. Post a hiatus caused by Iranian Nader Shah, Afghans consolidated and unified under Ahmed Shah Abdali and established rule over modern day Pakistan and parts of North India.\n\n1830-1947: Emirate of Afghanistan. With the coming in of the British rule in India, the Afghan rule abated but it was marked by three Anglo-Afghan wars and countless skirmishes where Afghanistan repeatedly disrupting territory in modern day Pakistan. Constant skirmishes and raids made the frontier known as a wild, restive region.\n\n1947-73: Kingdom of Afghanistan. The Durand line caused several skirmishes with Pakistan including serious ones in \'49, \'55 and \'60.\n\n1973-96: Republic of Afghanistan. The soviet satellite which was devastated by the Afghan war saw conflict often spill to Pakistan, thousands of Pakistanis directly died fighting in the war.\n\n1996-2001: Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Taliban ruled over the part of Afghanistan excluding controlled by Northern Alliance for all of five years. However in this period, Taliban either directly exported or gave refuge to mujahedin mercenaries who went on to fight in far flung areas from Chechnya, North Africa, South East Asia, Kashmir, Xinjiang and ultimately the conspiracy which hit New York. Meanwhile they caused major problems to India with militancy in Kashmir reaching historic highs.\n\n2001-present: Transition government. Involved in numerous skirmishes with Pakistan. However the real challenge came via Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, which ran an insurgency which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Pakistani soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians.\n\n**Insight:** We therefore have the history lesson of a thousand years to conclude that **Afghans, inevitably prey on other nations - this trend is only reinforced when Afghans are consolidated and united** under a single authority - as seems to be happening right now.\n\n**With this insight here is my attempt at reading geo-pol tea leaves,**\n\n1. **US, EU:** Tactically the retreat is a big win as the coalition rids itself from the world\'s first trillion dollar war which was needlessly propping up a thoroughly incompetent and corrupt Afghan plant regime. The biggest beneficiaries of the massive Allied effort clobbered into place by Bush\'s hectoring, ironically, were countries who were fence sitters: India which saw Kashmir insurgency ebb, Uighurs in China, Chechens in Russia, assorted militant groups in the Middle East, East and West Africa - all saw their "safe space" being taken away giving the respective nations a chance at respite and shoring defenses. Yes, there were the ISILs of the worldbut with an Afghanistan under Taliban, the situation would only have been much worse. The sheriff of the world can therefore hang his boots and take some well deserved rest. However, fully expect AQ and other old ghosts of the past to re-emerge within the next couple of years causing violent terror attacks on the west to surge. Politically this may strengthen right-wing parties.\n2. **China:** A major stink bomb just went off in China\'s backyard. I fully expect most BRI projects to stall and die out as the region is engulfed in a massive spiral of violence. While I do think any potential Uighur upsurge will be crushed down with a mailed fist, it will still cause China problems on its Eastern front where it wants to otherwise single mindedly focus on India. There already are reports of Uyghurs making up a few thousands in number of the Taliban. Overall the stakes in South China Sea and the Malacca straits as the only reliable trade route will increase and China\'s efforts to militarily secure this route will also build pressure on ASEAN, Taiwan and Japan - increasing instability and likelihood of war.\n3. **Russia and the Stans:** A Taliban victory is terrible news for Putin and other assorted dictators who rule the Stans. I fully expect separatist movements from Tatarstan to Chechnya to reignite. Ditto for Stans as Uzbeks, Tajiks etc now make up 40% of the Taliban and they will be more than eager to spread their banner over the countries of their ethnicity. Realpolitik from the West will only encourage these efforts to shake up Putin\'s throne.\n4. **India:** Like the ANA, India was also afforded 20 years to prep up its defenses. While one has clearly failed, it is to be seen how well India is able to deal with the surely coming upsurge in militancy. I fully expect a massive spike in fighter numbers, weapons and tech in the Kashmir insurgency. The more disturbing scenario is - in an increasingly communally divided India, such violence can also boil over to other parts of the country which have otherwise been quiet for two decades. The Taliban are essentially Deobandi and Barelvi - both Islamic movements with 10s of millions of followers in India as well, worst case scenario could see a massive influx of radicalized Indians who receive training and weapons in Afghanistan and wreck havoc in India, derailing the already stalled economic progress. Overall a grim outlook faces India.\n5. **Middle East, Africa and Turkey:** This region may face a divergent outlook. For most nations - Islamic movements will now have a safe sanctuary to organize, train, plot and gain strength - to challenge the dictatorships that rule these countries. Given the often extremely reactionary and short term thinking that the leaderships of these countries indulge in, some might even fund and facilitate such activities. However, Qatar and Turkey - might actually gain geo-pol by using Afghanistan\'s strength in waging asymmetric war by acting as agents that trade in this commodity. Fully expect civil wars and violence to reach new heights. Also tensions between Turkey-Qatar and GCC bloc may rise.\n6. **Iran:** Given that Afghanistan is 90-95% Sunni, the scenario looks bad for Iran as Sunni militants there will gain much strength. Like China however it is in a position to brutally clamp down on such movements. I do not however, see any silver lining for Iran as Taliban gain complete domination in Kabul. Iran may become more tightly coupled with the Turkish-Qatari axis to save its skin from the Taliban, in turn fueling tensions vs Saudi led GCC.\n7. **Pakistan**: Taliban gaining absolute control over Afghanistan in my opinion has the worst portends for Pakistan. What the western media characterizes as Pakistan\'s "control" over Taliban is more often a case where Pakistan actually having scant choice in the matter. Going along with Taliban afforded Pakistan advantages such as mujahidin\'s to deploy against India. The "new" Taliban has supplanted Pakistan\'s role of an intermediary by dealing directly as it is doing with China or via Qatar or Turkey. The withdrawal is an economic catastrophe for Pakistan as a new refugee influx looks very likely. However most importantly, billions of dollars of money that flowed from the West and was gained by Pakistan as direct or "gray" exports via trade to a modernizing Afg will now disappear. The West looking to find a whipping boy for its "failure" will look at "punishing" Pakistan economically via sanctions that will push its tottering economy towards total economic collapse. The West may also indulge in realpolitik to encourage movements such as TTP - potentially causing massive bloodshed and instability. The insurgency last time even as TTP was being droned by the US and squatted over Afg was intense, this new one will be magnitudes of order more severe - and with no aid from the west. Pakistan with an ideologically conservative society and rampant poverty unfortunately presents fertile grounds for this. Instability will also mean drying up of Chinese projects and connectivity that were hitherto progressing under the thankless shade of NATO in Afg. Most critically however - as the 10s of thousands of Pakistani mujahidins who fought for Taliban return to KPK and Waziristan, they will naturally want to put in place in Pakistan the same system as they put next door. Pashtun eyes on both sides will again look hungrily at Peshawar and Quetta. While Pakistan has used mujahidins in a calibrated manner in Kashmir, the challenge now will be holding the surge back. Given India\'s new nationalistic "muscular response" policy - this only means war with India becomes more likely than ever. Worst case scenario for Pakistan, the sub-continent and the world is the old nightmare of mad mullahs gaining power through a revolution - and by extension - Pakistan\'s nukes. For anyone wondering how a Afg-Pak conflict might go down, once the goodies start drying up in Kabul may read - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third\\_Anglo-Afghan\\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Afghan_War) \\- this may play out, without of course the Brits, Sikhs, Gurkhas and Dogras at play.\n\nOverall, given a few years, I expect the world to clamor back to the US and its allies for security. Also given the upheavals that are going to go down in the backyards of US\' main strategic rivals - Russia and China - stand to loose in the SCO sphere. So notwithstanding any spectacles of Taliban unfurling its banners over Kabul on the 9/11 anniversary, US stands to gain overall mid term with heightened risk of terrorist attacks - any such attack will mean pressure on Pakistan to deliver on the undeliverable. The biggest losers look to be sub-continental nations, with Pakistan and India facing the grimmest scenarios.\n\nFinally, let me also put up a long term view (completely ideal and hypothetical): the only solution to the Afghan issue is hinted at by the period under the Mughals where Afghanistan was split into three. Even now, a likely solution may involve a truly global military and diplomatic effort whereby the North goes to Stans, Western provinces to Iran and Eastern Pashtun provinces to Pakistan. The only catch however is that a super-large Pashtun population may again in turn alienate and cause resentment/separatism amongst Punjabi, Sindhi and Baloch populations of Pak.\n\nTl;dr - US withdrawal is likely infact going to strengthen it geo-politically while causing massive problems for the world at large but especially countries of the Indian subcontinent - politically the old "clash of civilizations"/xenophobic/right-wing dispensations will gain ground. Looking at historical patterns, the solution to contain the restive, war-like people of Afghanistan is to split the country along religio-ethnic lines and assimilate the regions into larger, stabler nations.'<br />Author: 'scenicLyf'  id: 'p3s4xx'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p3s4xx/a_historical_analysis_of_the_afghan_states_role/</li>

It seems Omidyar is pushing for FOSS to create US corp backed payment gateways to take the space of UPI. So far, govt was against hostile foreign private investment in payment gateways and was attempting to keep it under the control of govt of India (which is the sound approach for economic health &amp; security- imagine all payment gateways dominated by US which uses threat of sanction every second day for its neocolonialist expansion).\n\n\n&gt;So far, the Indian government has taken some highly interventionist steps to protect the UPI from global giants such as VISA and MasterCard. The NPCI has always controlled the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) and 63 interchange rates in a rather opaque fashion\n\n&gt;**Competition between payment networks can also be fostered by introducing FOSS and open standards. For example, countries that prefer multiple payment networks can follow the Mojaloop Project. Omidyar Network, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google (whose CEO describes itself as the Lockheed Martin to US military complex of 21st century), CIA proxy Rockefeller Foundation , and two startups–COIL and Modus Box—are together building this open-licensed federated\npayment network platform. They have taken inspiration from the UK’s Faster Payments Service and Australia’s New Payments\n66 Platform. The Mojaloop Project is meant for nations and central banks to adopt. The routing system depends on a technology called Interledger, which can work across multiple payment networks, blockchains and currencies, being an open protocol suite for sending and receiving digital payments.**\n\nhttps://www.orfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ORF_IssueBrief_380_Unified-Payments.pdf\n\nUnsurprising that Reliance backed ORF is pushing for more leeways for foreign-private partnerships in payment gateways given \n\n\nTwo months before Facebook\nannounced its investment in Jio, the RBI\npublished a “Draft Framework” for the\nauthorisation of a pan-India New\nUmbrella Entity (NUE) for Retail Payment \n\n\nAnother older collabroation of MeiTY &amp; Omidyar.\n\nhttps://vidhilegalpolicy.in/events/panel-discussion-on-data-trusts-for-the-public-good/\n\n\nEssays on Omidyar.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/ot5pzf/some_of_the_corporate_funding_to_our_socalled/\n\n*Promoting US backed Syrian rebels*\n\n&gt;Omidyar channels its donations to Forbidden Stories via Luminate which is a bigger umbrella of NGO funding for furthering US strategic goals than even OSF of Soros.

USAID provided 54% of “Center UA”’s budget for 2012. Center UA, along with the rest of Rybachuk’s interlocking network of western-backed NGOs and campaigns— New Citizen, “Chesno,” and “Stop Censorship” were the major orchestrators of mass protests against pro-Russia regime in Ukraine. Other funders included the US government-backed National Endowment for Democracy.**\n\n&gt;**In 2011, Omidyar Network gave $335,000 to “New Citizen,” one of the anti-Yanukovych "projects" managed through the Rybachuk-chaired NGO "Center UA." At the time, Omidyar Network boasted that its investment in "New Citizen" would help "shape public policy" in Ukraine:**\n\n&gt;“Using technology and media, New Citizen coordinates the efforts of concerned members of society, reinforcing their ability to shape public policy.\n\n&gt;“... With support from Omidyar Network, New Citizen will strengthen its advocacy efforts in order to drive greater transparency and engage citizens on issues of importance to them.”** In March 2012, Rybachuk — the operator behind the 2004 Orange Revolution scenes, the Anatoly Chubais of Ukraine — boasted that he was preparing a new Orange Revolution:**\n\n&gt;“People are not afraid. We now have 150 NGOs in all the major cities in our ‘clean up Parliament campaign’ to elect and find better parliamentarians....The Orange Revolution was a miracle, a massive peaceful protest that worked. We want to do that again and we think we will.”\n\n&gt;**Detailed financial records reviewed by Pando (and embedded below) also show Omidyar Network covered costs for the expansion of Rybachuk’s anti-Yanukovych campaign, “Chesno” (“Honestly”), into regional cities including Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Ternopil, Sumy, and elsewhere, mostly in the Ukrainian-speaking west and center.**\n\nhttps://pando.com/2014/02/28/pierre-omidyar-co-funded-ukraine-revolution-groups-with-us-government-documents-show/\n\n*Omidyar\'s blocking of public access to Snowden files and releasing each paper only as it becomes redundant*\n\nOmidyar also bought exclusive rights to Snowden NSA Cables, but refused to publish them unlike Wikileaks. "Somehow, the same billionaire who co-financed the “coup” in Ukraine with USAID, also has exclusive access to the NSA secrets—and very few in the independent media dare voice a skeptical word about it."\n\n&gt;Over four years later, The Intercept has published just a tiny fraction of the Snowden files. And some, including an explosive cable on the proxy war in Syria, were released years after they might have made an impact.\n\n&gt;In October 2017, The Intercept chose to publish a cable from the trove of NSA documents gathered by Snowden that revealed Saudi Prince Salman bin Sultan explicitly directing a faction of Syrian insurgents to “light up” Damascus and “flatten” its civilian airport on March 18, 2013. The cable also revealed that Saudi Arabia had supplied 120 tons of explosives to the armed opposition, resulting in attacks on the Syrian presidential palace and locations across Damascus. It noted that Saudi leadership was “very pleased” with the campaign of terror they had orchestrated through their proxies.\n\n&gt;As MintPress previously noted, that cable had been in the possession of The Intercept’s founders for over four years, but it was inexplicably held. Had it been released soon after The Intercept leadership acquired it, it would have revealed that the so-called “moderate rebels” were, in fact, waging a campaign of terror on behalf of foreign sponsors – and at a time when the U.S. was stepping up covert support to them. Yet The Intercept inexplicably waited until the Syrian conflict had reached its denouement, and handed the cable to Murtaza Hussain, a staff writer who has vehemently advocated for regime change for years.\n\n&gt;Apparently, not all Snowden leaks are created equal. While some have exposed the totalitarian designs of the U.S. intelligence apparatus, others are being used to further its agenda by homing in on national adversaries like China. Today, all of these files remain in the hands of a single publication owned by a billionaire with a clear affinity for the national security state.\n\nhttps://archive.is/dIW6M\n\n**Omidyar\'s funding of Pegasus NGOs- coincidentally co-funded by its partners in Ukraine regime change- Soros &amp; US govt- is enumerated below.**\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/RegimeChange101/comments/oryg54/cultivated_by_cia_per_wikileaks_bengal_cm/\n\nhttps://archive.is/QyP7w\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2018/08/08/how-omidyar-network-is-building-a-digital-code-of-ethics/\n\nhttps://archive.ph/RH1HM'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p3k1mg'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p3k1mg/instances_of_billionaire_philanthropic_org/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Where We Messed Up'<br />Body: 'One of the things that every Indian knows, somewhere in their hearts, is that as a nation, we have messed up. We may not all agree with where we have messed up - and most of our political divisions stem from this disagreement - but we all understand that we have messed up somewhere in our past. A rich and versatile nation as India has been throughout history does not fall on her knees in poverty without committing stupendous error. However, we seem to not understand *where* it is that we messed up. \n\nOne point on which many of us agree is that our mistake has something to do with how we dealt with the caste system. However, here again there are two factions in disagreement. One group agrees that our grand mistake was in creating the caste structure in the first place, and that without the caste system we would have made much greater progress. The other group asserts with equal vehemence that surrendering our caste structure was what caused our society to become less productive and capable. I believe that both these groups lack understanding of the situation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, so here is my take on the issue.\n\nLet us first understand the downfall of India in an accurate way. India did not fall because the traditions of India were undermined, nor did it fall because the traditions were what was keeping us weak. It was the other way round - Indians undermined their own traditions in an attempt to keep up with a changing world, where age-old traditions that had worked well for us were suddenly rendered useless at best, and poisonous to Indian society at worst. \n\n**The Caste System in the Pre-Industrial Era**\n\nIn the pre-industrial age, vocational specialization made an immense difference. That is why children in Europe, for example, were placed into apprenticeship, often under their own fathers, from an early age. Most professional groups were hereditary. That is why, even in Europe, there are surnames like Smith, Butler, Mueller, etc. \n\nThe caste system was the paragon of specialization. It was based on creating small hereditary communities which were entirely focused on one profession or the other. Most people tend to focus on the Brahmins or the Kshatriyas in the caste system, but the real diversity of castes was at the bottom end - where there were hundreds of caste communities counted as being agrarian or tradesman class. All of them were entire communities - sometimes entire villages - focused on producing one item specifically. There are still communities of silver embroiders in the state of Odisha who produce incredibly skillful works.   \n\nThe entire manufacturing process is divided up among the members of the family, and they work together with surprising coordination and efficiency. This system was the most efficient economic system in the pre-industrial world. \n\nSome people have pointed out that Shramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, and atheistic systems like Charvaka, were able to recruit massive numbers of people from low-caste groups because these groups were sickened by  the rigidity of caste-ridden Vedic society and wanted to leave. This is simply not true. \n\nThe Shramana movement did not recruit from the peasantry. Most of them were themselves high-born Kshatriyas and Brahmins, and sometimes very rich merchants. Take the *sangha* of the Buddha (his companion-disciples), and you can see this clearly. They were all Brahmins and Kshatriyas. Jain practitioners in the formative years of Jainism were almost entirely Kshatriya. Charvaka was a high-caste club, comprising of princes and scholars.\n\nBut even in the pre-industrial world, problems were beginning to show up.  \n\n**Problems with the Caste System before the Industrial Revolution**\n\nFor one thing, the lawmakers were all from a small number of castes - the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas, etc. While the customs of the local caste communities were to be respected in most law systems in Hinduism, it didn\'t change the fact that the legislative, the executive, the judiciary, the bureaucracy and the academia were all from hereditary groups that had little connection with productive labour. This led to the growth of intellectualism, which ultimately ended up disconnecting the lower castes from the upper castes, and therefore the mechanism of state from the mechanism of production. This is the Ivory Tower Syndrome. \n\nSecondly, the rigid division of people between castes was communal, which means that marriage and other basic interactions were restricted by which profession a tradesman had. This led to such enormous social division, that it eventually came to prevent the flow of ideas between communities. Cross-profession spread of ideas is the key to innovations, and the rate of innovation was severely stunted in the last one millennium. Heck, we could not even develop a solution to the problem of taking proper care of horses.  The Europeans were building effective stone bridges as early as 1066 AD, while we had no real practical bridges until the British took control. We relied on ferry systems to cross rivers.\n\nThirdly, certain caste groups became armed and powerful enough to become players in political games, such as the Mahars, but they were never recognized for their extra-vocational might due to the cultural system instituted by the caste system. The Mahars owed alleigiance to the Maratha royal dynasty of Shivaji Bhonsle who had armed them and made them warriors, but when the Peshwas - Brahmin Prime Ministers and Regents - swindled power away from the royal dynasty, they cast the Mahars into the bottom of the caste hierarchy. The Mahars, being an armed and powerful group, had no desire to accept this position and allied with the English East India Company, eventually taking the Maratha Empire down. There is nothing gained in accusing them of treason - what were they supposed to do, forgo their community\'s growth out of loyalty to an oppressive regime? \n\nFourthly, the caste system wrecked havoc on the cohesion of the nation. People identified with their own caste before every other cultural or political obligation. This fact was not lost on the English East India Company, and on other people. They soon realized that they could use this to their advantage, and they did. For instance, the merchants who exported cotton to Britain were a different caste from cotton planters, who were a different caste from the merchants who imported textile products from Britain. So Britain could purchase cotton cheap, process it, and sell it back at a hefty profit. And they did this for nearly two centuries, draining the nation of its wealth.\n\nBut the real reason for the end of the caste system was the Industrial Revolution. Essentially, the Industrial Revolution swept the ground from underneath the caste system, and it completely neutered any chances of a rigid society of hereditary profession groups from being able to perform well. In fact, specialization itself was rendered obsolete  by the assembly line.  \n\n\n**The Industrial Revolution**\n\nIn the eighteenth century, agriculture improved rapidly in Britain. Where once twenty farming had been able to collect grow food for for twenty-one families in all, now three agrarian families could feed a full twenty. The enormous shift in food production led to a great amount of surplus grain, which could be used to feed a standing army and a large urban population engaged in non-agricultural work. \n\nAt the same time, methods of converting chemical energy to fossil fuels were being worked out. Large numbers of people with little specialized skill could now begin working in production lines and produce items that only specialized people were able to prepare earlier, by dint of their hard labour. This effectively made specialization obsolete in many fields. Why would someone who had trained their entire life to get good at something be desirable, when five untrained folk were able to churn out products of reliable quality at a much better rate than them, with a single machine?\n\nThis made the caste system *irrelevant.* All of a sudden, its entire productivity was made obsolete. The caste system no longer was the most efficient system of production. But things got much worse.\n\nThe Western World was working out a new system now. With enough food and enough jobs, people were finally able to walk their way out of poverty and degeneracy, and they finally had bigger concerns in their minds that making sure of the next day\'s meals. A new idea of social structuring was being worked out - *emancipation.* And this was something entirely different. Here, everyone would be considered equals. There would be no slave, and there would be no masters. Trade would be free. People would be employed in any profession where an opportunity produced itself, and could work as much as they desired, earn their own bread, and be responsible for themselves. Nobility was an obsolete idea, and nobles were being shown the door (or the guillotine). People were planning to govern themselves.\n\nThis new social structure was so much more advanced and egalitarian than the caste system, that its mere origin made the caste system no more than a rusty article of a bygone world. Those who were wise in India recognized the situation immediately, and they rushed to fix Indian society, to remodel it after the Western fashion. But they were held back in several ways.\n\n**Problems with New Ideas**\n\nFor one, India was not industrialized, and really could not support an emancipated society. For another, the ideas of the French Revolution were so utterly alien to Indian philosophies that they could not be easily assimilated into the Indian mindset. For one thing, the European Enlightenment thinkers were working under completely different assumptions, with completely different axioms, and trying to solve completely different problems. Take the first line of the Declaration of Independence, which goes as follows:\n\n&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That  to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving  their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\nNot only were these utterly different from Indian thought, but they were not even the opposite of Indian thought. These ideas were not to Dharma what black is to white. They were to Dharma what apples are to white. They were an entirely different class of thought.\n\nDharma has never claimed that God gave humans rights, but we have never denied it either. Take the right to life, for instance. If God gives us a right to life, then why are we made mortal? If God gave us no right to life, then how do we live? The sentence makes little sense. We have pondered on the concept of a "right to life", but only in the context of inter-human interactions. The king, for instance, can forgive a prisoner destined for execution, therefore granting them a "right to life". What does God granting that right to people even mean? Is that right given to dogs?\n\nOf course, the American Declaration of Independence makes perfect sense within the context of the European discourse around Free Will, the Christian concept of Predestination and the Fall of Adam. But in the context of Hindu thought, it makes little sense whatsoever. But what really sealed our doom was the way we planned to assimilate these ideas, and our approach to them.\n\nMoreover, not only were these ideas so alien, but they were coming out at an alarming pace, which overwhelmed any endeavour to slowly assimilate their core principles into Indian thought. By the time we had fully understood the Revolution, Hegel as upon us. And by the time we could make sense of Hegel, Marx and Engels were spitting out more ideas. And before we could make sense of that, Focault and Popper had taken on an entirely different set of challenges and constructed their own answers. It was a storm of ideas, all increasingly alien, and each hitting us before we were done chewing the last.\n\n**India\'s Disastrous Assimilation Attempt**\n\nIndians committed several great blunders when trying to assimilate foreign ideas. We knew, way back in the 1940\'s when we received ~~Transfer of Power~~ "Independence", that we wanted to model our society on emancipation and egalitarianism. But this requires three things - an educated populace, an industrial workforce, and a set of ideas that can make emancipation work.\n\nOne in six Indians were literate in 1950. Our only industries were a few small ones - such as the Birla jute mill, the Godrej metalworks, the Tata factories - and they could scarcely employ a sizeable workforce. Building and maintaining factories require land, water, and convenient means of transporation and waste disposal. We had none of these. But the biggest problem, of course, was food.\n\nIndustrial societies require food security - enough on everyone\'s plate. Remember, we are pulling a large population out of the farms and putting them to work in places where they do not generate food. But these people must nevertheless eat. We need to massively improve the food production before this can work out, so that the few people employed in food production can feed the workers.\n\nAt the time of independence, and all the way until the 70\'s, India had a *shortage* of food.\n\nAnd that brings us to the next problem - assimilating ideas. European thinkers had generated several answers to the question of how an emancipated society would be able to retain order and function properly without a king or a Second Estate, but only two of them were still taken seriously by the time of our independence. The first was Capitalism, the system of Free Trade where people would interact in a primarily mercantile manner. All non-personal interaction would be mercantile. If you are employed at a job, you are providing a service - your labour - in return for the money you are paid. If you buy something, it is in return for money. Every transaction is a deal between two free individuals - the price is determined purely by the equillibrium of supply and demand, by the bargaining of both parties. The second was Socialism - the common service of everyone towards everyone, via media of the state. Everyone serves the state, and through the state everyone serves everyone else. When a construction worker helps build a road, they are employed by the state. The state takes credit for the road, and the road is made available to the citizenry. Everyone works to foster the state, and the state fosters everyone in turn. ~~Thus fostering one another, they reach the highest totalitarianism.~~\n\nThe authors of the former were well aware of the pre-requisites - venture capitalism and industries. The author or the latter, Karl Marx, was quite explicit in this - that his theory was not intended for agrarian societies. In fact, one of the oldest debates in Socialist philosophy has been over the "Agrarian Question" - how do you apply the doctrine of an old man living in a heavily industrialized society like late-nineteenth century Germany, and apply it to places like 1949 China, or 1917 Russia, where the society was mainly engaged in agriculture.\n\nBut it didn\'t matter to our M. N. Roys and our J. L. Nehrus that these ideas were probably not meant for India. They decided to implement them in India anyway, because why not? Instead of working out a method to implement these ideas in India in a reliable manner, they went right ahead and shoved their economic models down the throats of hundred of millions of tired, hungry, exhausted Indians. The result is in front of your eyes. It is what happens when the old Indian habit of copying answers from other students meets the new problem of smart teachers who make different question papers for different students.\n\n**My Takeaway**\n\nProgress is essential, and without progress we are destined for more colonization. But progress is fueled by progressive ideas, and most progressive ideas are poison to a Dharmic system, and mix as well with a Dharmic system as cyanide mixes with milk. Every single one of them has taken a toll on our mindsets. So what do we do?\n\nMy personal solution is *digestion.* Shri Rajiv Malhotra ji mentions the threat of Hindu ideas being *digested* by foreign groups, and this is seen as a danger by many educated and free-thinking Indians today. But to survive the jungle, it is not enough to not get eaten - you must also fill your own belly.\n\nAs the world changes, we will need to develop our own ideas to face change. And the first step should be to analyze and carefully assimilate foreign ideas into the matrix of thought within our culture, so they can be expressed in terms of axioms, assumptions, conditions and requirements which face us. Only then can we build ourselves a society which can stand both the test of time, and the test of rapid change.'<br />Author: 'Rajarshi1993'  id: 'p2wwf6'<br />Score:77<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p2wwf6/where_we_messed_up/</li>

Nobody from the "peaceful" community will change their hyperbreeding behavior because of a toothless law (which by the way will only stop Hindus from producing more kids). Stop this bullshit nonsense.\n\nIt is up for Hindus to incentivize the 2nd child amongst all (average secular) Hindu families so that one-child Hindu families are eliminated.\n\nIt is up to more religious Hindus to counterbreed and aim for 3 kids (or as many children as possible), following the example of Orthodox Haredi Jews in Israel who have lifted the Jewish TFR above the Muslim TFR. Muslim TFR is falling fast.'<br />Author: 'Delicious-Policy-837'  id: 'p2m42t'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p2m42t/stop_calling_for_a_population_control_law_or_a_2/</li>

OTP generation and finding a slot according to one's need &amp; the choice of vaccine was very easy. I didn't have to sit for hours waiting for updated from a bot and click on the button as fast as possible to find a slot for days. My vaccine was Covishield and I chose 12:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. timing. It was a government school. I reached there at 12:30 p.m. There was no huge crowd with a long line of people waiting. I registered my name with one of the three police officers who was sitting there. Then he took me and 6 other people to the classroom. There were 3 people there. The lady asked my name and the secret code which was received after booking the slot, and entered the detail in her mobile phone. My ID wasn't required this time. I asked her whether the vaccine was Covishield while she was taking out a new syringe and placing it in the vial &amp; she said yes. I was vaccinated within a few seconds. She told me to take Paracetamol in case I get a fever. I kept pressing the piece of cotton for a minute on my shoulder and then threw it in the dustbin. The police officer sitting outside the classroom told me and other people to wait in the Observation Room. It was a classroom inside the school, so there was no need to wait outside under the sun. I registered my name with the guard who was in the classroom. waited there for 30 minutes and then left. Social Distancing was being followed from the time I entered the school. \n\nThe whole process was quick and easy and without any of the hassles which were present during the first time. \n\nAnd has anyone of you taken your 2nd dose?

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] B-52s in Afghanistan, Hezbollah attacks Israel, and the history of V2'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread, the place where we discuss events from all over the world. News and discussion do not have to be related to India. Please share interesting stories and your thoughts in the comments. Here are a few to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [US sends bombers as Taliban take over Afghanistan](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-b-52-bombers-gunships-122236778.html)\n\nAs the Taliban comes close to taking control of three key Afghan cities - Kandahar, Herat, and Lashkar Ga - the US is stepping up the offensive even as nearly all American troops in the country have withdrawn. B-52 bombers have been running sorties from the US air base in Qatar to provide air support to Afghan ground forces. The Taliban have already taken control of the town of Zaranj in Nimroz, and the country is degenerating into a civil war between the Taliban and local warlords even as the national government loses influence outside of Kabul. Dawa Khan Menapal, the Afghan government\'s chief media officer, was recently assassinated by the Taliban as well. The US embassy has ordered all American civilians to evacuate the country, and thousands of Afghans that helped American forces (such as for translation) have been moved to the US as refugees.\n\n2. [Mass evacuations in Greece due to forest fires](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58124129)\n\nIn yet another summer of extreme weather in Europe, parts of Greece have gone up in flames due to forest fires, with the capital city of Athens experiencing dense smoke and poor air quality. The US, UK, and France have been providing support to Greek firefighters that are struggling to contain the inferno. Temperatures crossed 40C last week, with very dry conditions and strong winds making it conducive for the wildfires to spread. The fires have also erupted in neighbouring Turkey, causing mass evacuations.\n\n3. [Hezbollah fires rockets at Israel, first in 15 years](https://www.timesofisrael.com/with-first-rocket-attack-in-15-years-hezbollah-risks-war-to-test-israel/)\n\nIn a challenge to the new Israeli government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennet, Hezbollah fired a series of rockets into Israel and took "credit" for it. Previous rocket attacks have also been conducted by the Iranian-backed militia whose name means Hezb-o-Allah (Army of Allah), but the group always denied launching them, choosing to use Syria instead. This is the first time in 15 years that the group has openly attacked Israel form its home in Lebanon. Israel retaliated with its own airstrikes inside Lebanon. Speculation is rife that the attack was ordered by the new hardline President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi.\n\n4. [Thousands protest in Thailand as COVID-19 cases rise](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-08/thailand-covid-protests-riot-police/100359266)\n\nThousands of protesters took the streets to Thailand against the military dictatorship\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite lockdowns in Bangkok. They were met with riot police and water canons as they marched towards a military base where Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha lives. Police, in turn, where met with firecrackers and homemade bombs from the protestors. Thailand is facing a huge surge of cases because of the Delta variant and the country has failed to ramp up its vaccination drive, despite manufacturing the Oxford vaccine domestically under a licensing arrangement similar to the one in India. Protesters are demanding that money be moved from the military and monarch\'s budgets to ease the economic pain of the pandemic.\n\n5. [Booster shots take rich nations by storm](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/566857-some-americans-fudging-vaccine-records-to-get-unauthorized-3rd-shot)\n\nIn many countries, the idea of a third booster shot of COVID-19 is gaining traction. Countries like the UAE and Bahrain, which have used Chinese-made vaccines that are proving to ineffective, residents are being offered booster shots of Pfizer and other vaccines despite the fact that there is little evidence of the value of such extra shots. European countries have also been discussing providing booster shots, as has Israel. In the US, which does not have a central registry of vaccinations, people have been lying to get an unauthorized third dose even as the Delta variant tears through the unvaccinated. The WHO has condemned booster doses, pointing out scant evidence that they provide much value but allow rich countries to continue to hoard vaccines even as new variants may arise from poorer ones.\n\n# Geopolitical History: V2 and modern rocketry\n\n"It isn\'t rocket science" - a common American phrase, used to imply both that a task at hand is simple, and that rocket science is hard. And rocket science is indeed very hard - but it has been done. Humanity regularly shoots rocks into space as well as at each other. It may be argued that the human species has always been interested in reaching out into the sky - we see it in the sophisticated astronomy developed in ancient India, and the mythology surrounding the abodes of the gods in the clouds. But when did we take concrete steps to rise not only to the clouds, but beyond? As with everything, it was a mixture of ambition, genius, and war.\n\nThe story begins in the 1930s in Weimar Germany. The country had been defeated in WW1, stripped of its military and foreign colonies, indebted with huge reparations and limits to industrialization, and its political system overturned with the abolition of the monarchy and a system of weak coalition governments. And yet, despite these drawbacks, it was a time of much innovation of German universities. At the Technical University of Berlin - a venerable institution to this day - a young PhD student named Wernher von Braun had a passion for shooting objects into space. His dream, he often said, was to personally be the first man to land on the moon. And he didn\'t just dream, he worked on it. His PhD research was on the use of liquid-fueled rockets. Let\'s get some background about the issues he faced: the fundamental problem of rocketry (or aeronautics, more generally) is that a rocket needs enough energy to at least lift its own weight against gravity, but that energy has to come from fuel that itself has weight. So the more fuel that the rocket stores, the heavier it is, and the more fuel it needs - a vicious cycle that kept humanity firmly on the ground. Von Braun had an insight: if the fuel could generate more energy than its own potential energy, and that energy could be efficiently utilized, then this fundamental problem could be overcome.\n\nHis completed PhD thesis,  *Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket*, was completed in 1934 and was revolutionary - he proposed using a mixture of alcohol and liquid oxygen to generate energy (thrust), and compressed nitrogen through a nozzle to use that energy efficiently enough to not just push a rocket off the ground, but imbue it with enough kinetic energy so that it moves faster than the speed of sound - the supersonic rocket. His thesis had the experimental proof-of-concept and theoretical justification, and was a marvel. It also caught the attention of the German Army and the new ruling party - the Nazis. His thesis was immediately classified and he was given a small fortune by the military to further develop his idea in a newly-developed research center in the Prussian seaside town of Peenemünde. Von Braun and his colleagues, together with published research from American engineer Robert Goddard, created the first prototype for a rocket: the Aggregate 1 (A1), "aggregate" being the German word for a machine. A1 and subsequently A2 were successful, but they were very small, hardly weapons of any serious war.\n\nThen, in 1936, the military gave them a number - their rocket should be able to deliver a 1 ton warhead over a distance of 172 miles. That called for a much larger rocket with vastly more complex systems, including the ability for the rocket to orient itself without needing radio instructions, which could be jammed. As the team worked on the problem, Hitler invaded Poland and WW2 began. Officers on the frontline who were aware of the Peenemünde project were angry that so much money was being diverted there, but it is said that Hitler himself supported the idea of using rockets, more so after the Nazi defeat in the Battle of Britain. It took as late as 1944, when Nazi Germany was on the run from the Allies and her cities being bombed every day, for Von Braun to develop his best prototype - the A4. Again, Hitler was said to have been so impressed by the idea of being able to hit London and Allied cities on the Continent with a supersonic weapon that he immediately ordered its mass construction using prisoners in concentration camps. The Nazis also gave the A4 a more colourful name - the Vergeltungswaffe Zwei, or "Retribution Weapon 2," since it was meant to be used to bomb London as retribution for the bombing of German cities. The short name was the V2. \n\nIn a little over a year, the Germans fired over 3,000 V2 rockets, most of them at Antwerp and London. In London, the rockets killed about 9,000 people - a modest number by WW2 standards, but it caused Londoners to live in a constant state of fear and panic. One V2 is said to have landed a few hundred yards from Parliament itself. Since it was supersonic, the V2 compressed air itself, and people would sense the change in pressure mere seconds before being hit by the weapon. Every little breeze brought fear of death. Although the Allies never figured out how to counter the weapon itself, for their own rocketry was not that sophisticated, Germany eventually stopped using them because they could no longer produce enough alcohol and liquid oxygen for fuel. It was calculated that a single rocket required 3 tons of potatoes to produce enough alcohol, and that had to come out of the food rations of the German population as well as occupied countries. The V2 programme, although quite impactful, was an unsustainable tantrum from a force that was on its deathbed. \n\nHowever, V2 didn\'t end with the War. Nazi Germany was too weak to have put the weapon to its full potential, but the victorious Allies were not. After the capitulation of the Nazi regime, a scramble for V2 technology began - both the plans and the human capital behind them. The US recruited German engineers and scientists, many of them members of the Nazi party and war criminals by the standards of the Nuremberg trials. They were brought to America and given new identities, their case files (then on paper) stripped of their past with only the impression of a paperclip to show that something was missing in them. It was aptly named Operation Paperclip. Von Braun was one of the men who moved to America, where he played a pivotal role in America\'s rocket and space program. He led the team that used V2 technology to launch America\'s first satellite, the Explorer 1, and was later inducted into the leadership of NASA for the Apollo missions that fulfilled his dream of sending man to the moon.\n\nThe other superpower, the USSR, was able to go one step further and capture the production lines of the V2, which were in its occupation sphere in Germany. By 1948, using German engineers (many of them again former Nazis) and captured technology, the USSR developed the R-1 rocket, a copy of the V2. Larger rockets based on the same principles but improved metallurgy were also developed over time, of which the R-7 was the one that eventually launched Sputnik into space. The USSR also shared the V2 technology with its Communist allies, China and North Korea, with China\'s first ballistic missile, the DF-1, being a copy of the Soviet R-2, which was an improved version of the V2. To this day, North Korea\'s sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile program is based on the knowledge gained from the Nazi-Soviet technology transfer. The technology eventually found its way to the likes of Iran and Pakistan as well. And it all began with a young man\'s dream to fly to the moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'Busting the propaganda around Petrol/Diesel Taxes(Credits to u/HenryDaHorse)'<br />Body: " As we have seen in the last 7 years, our Modiji keeps increasing Central taxes on Fuel &amp; it's justified by saying \n\nStates get 42% of the central taxes on Fuel, so all the increased revenue is not only going to Modiji but also to the states \n\nPoor Modiji has to pay back oil bonds taken by the UPA &amp; hence he has to levy more taxes. \n\nPoor Modiji has to pay for vaccines, hence more taxes \n\nLet's take a look at these 3 claims. I am using Petrol mostly to do the calculations, but Diesel is also quite similar. \n\n1. State's share of Central Taxes on Fuel \n\n**Q: How much of Central Tax on Petrol goes to the States?** \n\n**A: 1.7% of the Petrol Central Taxes goes to the States. 98.3% goes to the Union Govt. Diesel is 2.3% to States &amp; 97.7% to the Union Govt.** \n\nLet's start with how much Central Taxes on Petrol was in 2014 &amp; how much it is in 2021 \n\nCentral Taxes per litre of Petrol \n\n2014\n\n2021\n\nCentral Taxes\n\nRs. 9.48\n\nSo Central Taxes on petrol is nearly **345%** of what it was before Modiji. It's increased by **245%**. \n\n**But 42% of the taxes go to the States. So Union Govt gets only 48% of the taxes!!! - FALSE** \n\nIt's true that 42% of the Basic Excise Duty is shared with states but the Rs 32.9 is not the Basic Excise Duty but it's the total Central Taxes. \n\nThere are 3 components to Central taxes on Fuel \n\nBasic Excise Duty \n\nSpecial Additional Excise Duty (SAED) \n\nCess \n\nNow, these components are split into the **Divisible Pool** &amp; the **Non-Divisible Pool**. \n\nOnly Basic Excise Duty falls in the Divisible Pool while SAED &amp; Cess fall in the Non Divisible Pool. Only the amount which falls in the Divisible pool is shared with the states. The Non-Divisible Pool goes totally to the Union Govt. \n\nNow let's see the breakup of Central taxes currently. \n\nTax\n\nAmount\n\n**Basic Excise Duty**\n\n**Rs. 1.4**\n\nSpecial Additional Excise Duty\n\nRs. 11\n\nRoad/Infra/Education Cess\n\nRs. 18\n\nAgri Cess \n\nRs. 2.5\n\nTotal \n\nRs 32.9\n\nOnly the bolded part is shared with the States \n\n42% of the Rs. 1.4 (&amp; not the whole 32.9) is shared with the states. i.e. **only 59 paise of the Rs. 32.90 goes to States. Rs. 32.31 remains with Modi**. \n\nComparing Tax components between 2014 &amp; 2021 \n\nTax\n\n2014 \n\n2021\n\n**Basic Excise Duty**\n\n**Rs 1.2**\n\n**Rs 1.4**\n\nSpecial Additional Excise Duty\n\nRs. 6\n\nRs. 11\n\nRoad/Infra/Education Cess\n\nRs 2.38\n\nRs. 18\n\nAgri Cess \n\n0\n\nRs 2.5\n\n**Total** \n\n**Rs. 9.58**\n\n**Rs 32.90**\n\nSo if you see \n\nThe divisible pool (shared with states) of tax on Petrol has increased by **20 paise** The non-divisible pool (**not** shared with states) has increased by **Rs. 26.12** \n\nSo almost all the increases in Central Fuel Tax is kept by the Union Govt. The increase in the divisible pool in 7 years is 16%. The 200+% increase in the taxes have come in the non-divisible pool which isn't shared with the states. \n\n**States also levy their own separate taxes on Fuel (VAT/Sales Tax)**, but the above is about the Central Taxes which IT cell justifies by saying is shared with the states. Yes, it is shared. But only 1.7% of it goes to States. 98.3% is kept by Union Govt. \n\n**So, Myth#1 busted** \n\n2. Poor Modiji had to increase taxes to pay for the Oil Bonds issued by UPA\n\nFirst of all Oil Bonds were not only issued by the UPA, Oil Bonds were also issued by Vajpayee which the UPA paid. \n\nOther than let's look at the claim itself. \n\nThe center pays somewhere between 10,000 to 20,000 crores per year for the Oil Bonds. \n\nIn 2014-15, the center got 1 Lakh crore on Excise Duty (Can't find figure for the last UPA year, was probably lower than that). \n\nIn 2020-21, the center's share of the Excise duty was 3.71 Lakh crores. So they got a minimum 2.71 Lakh crores extra on Excise Duty in 2021 itself this year. \n\nOver the 7 years, the Union Govt's share of the extra Excise Duty was 8.65 Lakh crores. i.e. Modiji made 8.65 lakh crores in Additional taxes on Fuel. Assume they paid 1.05 crores in 7 years for oil bonds. Even covering for that, the extra taxes (because of the tax hikes) going to the Union Govt over 7 years was 7.60 Lakh crores. \n\nSo there goes the myth that Modiji increased taxes to pay for Oil Bonds. The Tax Guzzling Union Govt actually increased taxes by 8 times what was actually needs to cover the oil bonds. i.e. out of every 8 rupees of increased taxes, only 1 Rupee was needed to cover the Oil Bonds. The other 7 Rs went to the Big Central Government. \n\n**So, Myth #2 Busted** \n\n3. Poor Modiji doing this to pay for vaccines. \n\nFor one, Tax increases on Fuel didn't start in 2020. They started in 2014 itself. Modiji has been increasing taxes on Fuel from 2014 on. Even when World Oil Prices were at 30$ a barrel, we were still not getting the benefit because each time Oil Prices dropped, Modiji increased Taxes on Fuel. Excise Duty in 2015-16 itself was twice was it was in 2014-15. He has been looting us for 7 years. In these 7 years. the Union Govt has made an additional 8.65 lakh crores of additional revenues over what they would have made without Modiji's tax increases. \n\nThe vaccine cost is probably going to be around 30,000 crores (even lesser probably considering how 25% of the vaccines are done by private providers). \n\nSo 8.65 lakh crores of tax increases in 7 years to pay for 30,000 crores of vaccines. Just in 2020-21, itself Fuel tax increase was 1.5 lakh crores over 2019-20. I don't even have the guts to compare it with 2013-14. \n\nAnd of course, there is PM Doesn't Care fund. In the first 5 days, the fund got 3000 crores in donations. No idea how much is their current corpus, but I am sure it would be a good amount. \n\n**So, Myth #3 Busted** \n\n**Excise is not the only revenue made on Petroleum products. There is a lot more**\n\nExcise Duty is not the only revenue Modiji makes from Petroleum Products. He makes a lot of other revenue. \n\n**Even before the crude oil is sent to the refineries, Modiji makes money on it**. \n\nIn 2014, when Modiji took over, we had 38 paise cess per litre of domestically produced Crude Oil. Now it's Rs. 66 paise per litre of domestically produced Crude Oil. So roughly another extra 66 paise per litre of Petrol goes to Modiji (Other than the Excise Duty). \n\nIn 2014, when Modiji took over, we had **Zero Custom Duty** on Imported Crude Oil. In 2021, there is 2.5% Customs Duty on Imported Crude Oil. That works out 66 paise per litre of Imported Crude Oil. \n\nBut wait, this is still not all the revenue which the Union Govt gets from Petroleum Products. Other than this, they also get more (none of which is shared with the states) (Projected figures for 2020-21) \n\nAll the stuff \n\nCustoms Duty Rs. 13,512 crores \n\nRoyalty on Crude Oil/Natural Gas - 3,590 crores \n\nNational Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) - 1,016 crores \n\nGST (though there is no GST on petrol/diesel, there is still GST on other taxes - like GST is levied on customs duty &amp; other things ) - 17,752 crores \n\nOther taxes on Petroleum related stuff - 365 crores \n\nCorporate Taxes on Petroleum Companies - 21,909 crores \n\nDividend from Petroleum PSUs to Modiji - 10,393 crores \n\nProfit from Petroleum Exploration - 35,174 crores. \n\nAdding everything, the **Center got Rs 4.54 Lakh crores** from Petroleum related income in 2020-21. \n\nOTOH, **all states put together just made 2.18 Lakh crores** from Petroleum related income in 2020-21 (Other than the VAT/Sales tax, just like the Union Govt, states also have other income from Petroleum related products like Royalty, Dividend Income etc). \n\nSo if we consider all the income made from Petroleum products, **the states got 32% of it &amp; the Union Govt got 68% of it**. \n\n**Sources:** \n\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/business/business-news/govt-raises-excise-duty-on petrol-and-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-no-change-in-retail-prices-813613.html \n\nhttps://iocl.com/admin/img/UploadedFiles/PriceBuildup/Files/English /906e78535dd4439a985356ed135219e9.pdf \n\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/content/441464/govt-raises-excise-duty-petrol.html\n\nhttps://www.ppac.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/PP\\_2\\_CustomsExciseTariff.xls https://www.ppac.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/PP\\_4\\_ContributionToExchequer.xls \n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/govt-s-excise-collections-on-petrol-diesel jumps-88-to-rs-3-35-lakh-crore-1829988-2021-07-19 \n\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/business/union-budget-2021-agri-infra-cess-of rs-2-5litre-applied-on-petrol-rs-4-on-diesel-3373217.html"<br />Author: 'Parallax2077'  id: 'p0i2c4'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p0i2c4/busting_the_propaganda_around_petroldiesel/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Thread by Shivani Singh, author of Nalanda on colonial conquest of Bharat post independence.'<br />Body: 'The 1947 coup d’état\n\nHow the jewel stayed in the crown-\nIt was a time for celebration in 1947 for the British Raj. Because the transfer of power from the Queen to an oligarchy loyal to the Queen had been smooth. India could now be run on auto-pilot.\n\nThe singleminded British ambition to control by any means had borne fruit.\nThey had finally and successfully managed to annex and conquer the country they called India.\nHow had they done it? \n\nThey had first understood the fatal flaw of the 584 kingdoms that ruled this coveted land of milk and honey.\nIt was not lack of unity.\nIt was too much diversity.\nIf that can be considered a fatal flaw.\n\nOnly one cultural connection bound the disparate kingdoms.\nDharma. \n\nIt was important to find its fault line. And they found it. Though united, the dharma followed was too diverse, too inclusive, too accepting of the unrefined barbarism of the marauder.\nOptimising this should have made the conquest easy.\nBut strangely it didn’t. \n\nFirst, the British innocuously united these kingdoms in land revenue and administrative systems. They archived, they chronicled, they made records. Surreptitiously the clerk tried to become the crown, but didn’t really succeed. \nThey built logistical networks and roads and rail and land record systems and boarding schools. They put kingdoms in a hierarchy, rated them and handed out gun salutes as entitlement. \nBut even though finally the kingdom with the highest number of gun salutes still remained a chieftain of the Queen, they still didn’t really succeed.\n\nBecause subsidiary alliances and chambers and friendship treaties was all they could really achieve. \nThis meant that they could not go beyond indirect rule. India was still beyond their reach.\nAnd there were still amongst the kings those whose insouciance was invincible. \nProud ancient kingdoms like Chittor that had withstood bloodthirsty marauders for centuries seemed immune to the white man’s cunning.\n\nAll that changed in 1947.\n1947 was a bloodless coup.\n\nIt was a coup because about 584 princely states acceded to the dominion of India. \nA dominion, unbeknownst to them, ruled by imperialists on auto-pilot.\nThis was the real reason for India’s independence. So that British Raj’s indirect rule could become direct rule.\n1947 was celebration time. \n\nThe next step soon followed the celebration. The democratic abolishment of the privy purse and the Zamindari act. This wiped out all source of income for princely states. Without land they were left without a penny to their name. \nMost importantly this was a decapitating blow for Hindu dharma. Because only kings were patrons of Hindu dharma and the temple was the nerve centre of all cultural activities. In one fell swoop Hindu science and scholarship, education, art, craft and literature was wiped out. \n\nBut knowing the tenacity of Sanatana dharma to prevail at all costs the oligarchy took 2 more constitutional decisions. Decisions that made Hindu dharma the bloodless corpse it is today. \n\n1. With Article 30 and the RTE act the Christian and the Muslim had the right to religious education but the Hindu did not. \n\nSo no Gurukula,no Vaidyashala, no Ayurvedic research, no Hindu art and architecture. With no choice the Hindu opted for Christian colleges and convents over the madrasah. Maybe because in Christian education systems conversion is more covert than the overt madrasah. \n\nAlso a Christian education was the only avenue for livelihood.\n\n2. All temple administration came under government supervision. \n\nSo all donations from the still resiliently devout Hindu went to the oligarchy that diverted these funds to more madrasahs and more Christian education systems.\n\nThat’s why you see pundits and pujaris begging outside temples. Not because they are greedy. \nBut because a Hindu pujari, unlike a maulvi or a pastor has no means of livelihood.\n\nDeath by economic halal.\n\nWe are a secular country.\nCongratulations!\n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1424265845052641285.html'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'p0h0ls'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p0h0ls/thread_by_shivani_singh_author_of_nalanda_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I am a woman and here is why I shaved my head bald.'<br />Body: "Reposting as requested. \n\n[The day I braved the Shave](https://imgur.com/a/tlTakFL)\n\nI usually don't post but thought this time I should. Sorry if I made any mistakes. \n\nWhat’s the best gift you’ve ever given?\n\nYou may think of an expensive watch you gave your best friend or  a piece of clothing you gave your mom on her birthday. But I know that the best gift I’ve ever given anyone was a piece of myself – my hair.\n\nI recently shaved my head for the first time. I had thought about it before, but coming from an orthodox Indian family. I wasn't even allowed to cut my hair short, forget shaving it. But going bald was always there in my bucket list. Why not do it for a cause, I thought.\n\nThat became a bit of an obsession. My husband didn’t want me to go bald. But there are some things in life which you do for you. I knew a friend who had donated her hair before. So I bugged her until she passed on all the information available.\n\nI told my closest friends about it. They regretted that I’d lose my lovely locks, but they admired the fact that I was donating for a cause and were proud of the guts I demonstrated in shaving the head.\n\nGoing Bald Involves a Lot of Preparation, Peeps!\nAfter all, bald head almost always signifies bad news. Or lesbianism. Which is bad news too, in a conventional society like India.\n\nI read up on other people’s experiences of going bald. Prepared myself for hair depression. Thought of it as growth — getting out of the comfort zone, removing the one sure-shot attraction point, and so forth.\n\nI kept myself upbeat thinking of the wonderful new experience baldness would be. I fancied seeing a faceless happy smile on someone’s face. \n\nFinally, when hubby was out of town for work. I booked an appointment to get this done. ( It was a smart decision to not get into an argument, I just said I was going to donate my hair. He had no clue that I was going to go bald! )\n\nHow did it feel?\n\nIt actually is empowering, and there's a sense of freedom to not be bound by what society views as beauty. You get to meet the real you.  \n\nI was extremely emotional as it was happening. I saw the blade move across my head and my heart was in my mouth. There was no going back now. This step was particularly difficult for me because I’ve always been extremely fond of my hair. Especially, because with curly, dry hair, maintenance takes time and effort and, needless to say, one gets attached to it over time when you put in so much effort in maintaining it.\n\nTo say it was quite a drastic change is putting is mildly. As the hair got separated from my head, I was battling myriad emotions – excitement, anxiety, pride because this was something I was doing for a specific reason. I was worried also about how it would look and what would people say. Although that wasn’t on my mind at all when taking this decision or even while sitting on the chair. But once it was all over and I saw myself in the mirror, the enormity of what I’d done hit me.\n\nWhen I posted about this online. My social media was flooded with comments, surprisingly, postive.  \n\nThe absence of long wavy tresses covering my shoulders is still something I am getting used to. It was only yesterday that I realized I could put away my favourite hairclip that was still lying on my bedside. I’m thrilled at what I’ve done, of course. It’s liberating, physically and spiritually. It accords one a sense of freedom and agency that can only be experienced. It’s empowering to feel that fearless and freedom. Not just because of not having long lustrous locks, but also from what people would think or say.\n\nOf course, I still get startled every time I see myself in the mirror. It takes me a few seconds of wondering if the person in the mirror is actually me, to reminding myself that I need to get used to what I look like now. And while that may take some getting used, what I know now is that I really do feel pretty.\n\nWhat has the reception been like?\n\nThe only people who ever say negative things are men, suggesting that I’ve made a mistake and soon enough I’ll return to my rightful place as a woman with long hair ( they wish). It’s annoying how many men feel entitled to make suggestions for how I should present myself. But at the same time, the overwhelming support I’ve gotten from other women has reminded me that the thoughts of a few men including my husband don’t need to upset me. So many men are still resistant because the idea that women can be strong and challenge their traditional place is horrifying for some of them.\n\nHow did it affect my professional life ?\n\nIn no way whatsoever. I thought it might. But apart from the curiosity of my colleagues. There was no affect. \n\nTo those of you who think you can't do it?\n\nI'd like you to know that it's OK to stop hiding behind hair and try something new. We may fear doing so because of the names we might be called, but we are not our hair. There are no negatives to the bald look. I'm not defined by it. Plus, I get to sleep like a wild animal and not wake up to bed hair. Moreover. I have gifted a smile to an innocent soul who didn't have the option but lost her hair. \n\nWill I do it again? \n\nTotally! It’s awakening. \n\nMost importantly, I hope more people donate their hair. You don’t always have to go bald to donate. That was my personal choice. But if you do go bald, you lose nothing. You aren’t defined by any part of your body. Hair is homegrown, people. It takes nothing to you to give it up, but getting it would mean a lot to a person who lost their hair to a disease they didn’t really ask for.\n\nAbout the Organisation I donated to ?\n\nI am not really sure if I am supposed to mention any names here and hence if anyone wants to get in touch with this organisation or know more about them can reach out to me and I'll surely help. \n\nIt's a totally based in India organization which has partnered with the top NGOs and hospitals in india for cancer care. The best thing I loved about them was it's totally local and accepts donation from all over India. And the volunteers are very supportive. This organisation also works towards breaking the stigma around bald women being considered ugly and hence even if you think your hair can't be used to make wigs. Reach out to them and they will help you brave the shave for a cause."<br />Author: 'prettymuchaishu'  id: 'p0bhsr'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p0bhsr/i_am_a_woman_and_here_is_why_i_shaved_my_head_bald/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What I believe to be Indian society’s main problem concerning dating and relationships right now'<br />Body: 'As an outsider and a diaspora Indian I have made some observations between the extreme liberal western culture and the extreme conservative Indian culture when it comes to dating and relationships. \n\nIn the west what has happened is that people have become extremely sexually liberated. A little bit too sexually liberated in my opinion. Everyone sleeps around a lot. My older siblings in college have told me how everyone has had dozens of casual sexual partners by the time they graduate. Casual sex and hookups are very common here. I personally do not like this and I think its is bit extreme. Because there are many bad things that come from this type of behavior. Such as STDS, lack of romantic connection with partners, loosing the value of intimacy. Also this type of sexual degeneracy leads to unwanted teen pregnancies, single parenthood and the fall of society. Its been proven in studies that single parenthood determines the success rate of the children. Kids from single parent households do much worse in life than kids from households with 2 parents.\n\nIn India it is the extreme opposite. I think Indias main problem is that dating is not allowed at all and looked down upon in most areas. I mean you have those Valentines day moral police who beat up any couples they see together in parks. Boys and girls are often separated in classrooms and not allowed to interact with one another. Sex education is not provided for young adults and teens. This causes people to become very curious about the opposite gender. Which then leads to sexual violence as well. Because when young boys are never allowed to interact with females they become curious and start seeing girls as these mysterious objects to be conquered and not as human beings. \n\nBasically what I am saying is that India right now is too conservative in terms of dating and relationships and western society is at the opposite end of the spectrum where everyone is too open about it. I hope that Indian people will learn from the west and find the right balance between these two extremes. Because I think both extremes are bad. Not being allowed to interact with the opposite gender is bad. But sleeping around with dozens of sexual partners is also bad. (In my personal opinion)\n\nThis is just my personal opinion on what I think would be the right balance for dating and relationships:\n\nYoung adults should be allowed to date once they reach a certain age because its bad to repress these emotions in human beings. I would say late teenage years is when kids should be allowed to have boyfriends and girlfriends. So by the time they are in their mid twenties they will have had enough relationship experience and will have picked out a suitable partner for themselves to marry by then. Relationships in these early years should be focused around friendship, compatibility and figuring out what you want in a partner. I think casual sex and hookup culture should be discouraged. Intimacy should be preserved only for people who you are in serious relationships with, or better yet, saved for until after marriage. People say that India has low divorce rates because of how great arraigned marriages are, but I disagree. I think the divorce rate is low because divorce is taboo and frowned upon. Many couples in India would have had a divorce by now if it was not such a taboo thing. Even in my family there are many unhappy arraigned marriage couples who are staying together only because of “log kya kahenge?”. I think if people were allowed to go though the dating process and choosing their partners based off of compatibility it would lessen the amount of unhappy marriages in India. Because lots of arraigned marriages in India are based on superficial things like money and caste, and they are also often rushed as well, where couples get married within just weeks of knowing each other. You should wait at least one year before deciding to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe there needs to be a balance between being extremely sexually liberal and extremely sexually conservative.\n\nThese are only my personal opinions and observations as an Indian who lives in America.

      <li>Title::: 'You pay MORE on food delivery apps than when you buy food at the restaurant, despite the alluring discounts on the apps'<br />Body: " \n\nI'm sure some of you already know about this, but just in case you didn't, I've documented just how much more you pay every time you get food ordered on food delivery apps.\n\nToday I got some food ordered at a restaurant in person and just to check the same prices on Zomato, which is what I usually use to get food at home, I filled the cart with all the items that I got. To my shock, **the price difference was Rs.306.60**!!!\n\nOf course there's an option to add a promo code to get a discount and I was able to add a code to get Rs.118.80 off, but that was still Rs. 157.86 more. Seeing such a large discount makes it look crazy because when you see that without knowing the actual menu pricing in the restaurant, you think to yourself, why the hell would anyone go to the restaurant where you can't get this discount?! But it's all just an illusion. You're effectively paying Rs. 157.86 for the comfort of receiving that food at home. And sadly, not all of it goes to the actual person delivering the food to you, even though that's what you're mostly paying that extra amount for.\n\nI've been warned by some restaurants that their menu on the apps are higher than their in-restaurant menu because they have to offset the fees that these apps charge for every order. But I was alarmed by how much they usually end up offsetting. There's a RS. 60 difference between chicken biriyani in restaurant vs. the app, just as an example.\n\nHere's the paper receipt and the cart on Zomato for comparison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The paper receipt.

      <li>Title::: 'The ineffectiveness of Law enforcement is a major problem plaguing India.'<br />Body: 'Recently there was a viral video of a girl in Lucknow assaulting a cab driver when it was her fault. Now there are some idiots blaming feminism for it and as far as the feminists are concerned, the radical ones are defending the girl, while others are trying to slide it under the rug. \n\nBut there\'s a bigger problem that I notice, and that is this incident happened in the presence of the Police (there was one traffic police officer and another man in a khakhi uniform who maybe regular police or a volunteer). So my question is simple, why didn\'t the police stop it? Was it because they feared that public outrage may harm them? This is a nation run by a court of law and not of public opinion...... Or is it?\n\nThat video got viral and there was public outrage so the girl was booked. But would the man have gotten justice if there were no cameras there?\n\nI don\'t blame the police officers, our system sucks. Remember the riots in Bangalore last year, where an angry mob stormed a police station and vandalised it. The police had to wait for orders to defend themselves! Why even bother giving them guns? \n\nThere are countless examples, where the effectiveness of our police was affected because of this mess they call "the system". We need a complete overhaul of our law enforcement if we want to progress as a country. Ineffectiveness of law and order is the reason why riots happen. Ofcourse there are prejudices, but if Indians feared the consequences and respected the law these wouldn\'t breakout so often.\n\nI hope someday a sane government invests in the police force.'<br />Author: 'devansh_-_'  id: 'oz3f5m'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/oz3f5m/the_ineffectiveness_of_law_enforcement_is_a_major/</li>
