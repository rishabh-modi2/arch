Bollywood stars are known to consume drugs. Gauri Khan was detained at an airport for this. Sanjay Dutt, Fardeen Khan etc. were also rehabilitated. We know Bollywood's connection with  Dawood Ibrahim. Then why are people so obsessed with this case? Some call it a witch-hunt while some are blaming the NCB offcial  Sameer Wankhede. I am not blaming anyone but Bollywood certainly is promoting drugs, they do have drugs connection. But our people's focus is on who is right, who is wrong. Some set of people feels it is injustice, some feel he should not get bail. Social media is full of messages regarding this case. There are so many people who don't get get justice since years, are held for similar reasons.

A year before that, he himself had formulated the doctrine of *sama dama danda bheda* – persuasion, purchase, punishment and deceit. To learn these methods, and to learn when to employ each method, was the art of cunning.\n\nOver these two years, he had repeatedly won debates against opponents, from students to professors to nobles and other interested parties, who were initially convinced of viewpoints most opposed to his own, and he had converted them to the truth. He had done so without uttering a single lie, without a single line of argument that was not based in reason, without the use of emotion or of any form of manipulation. \n\nPublic debates were the most high-status events that the university held, and the courtyards in which they were held would be populated by visitors from other gurukulas, as well as by nobles and other wealthy men who sought to signal that they were well-versed in the sciences. But to hear Chanakya speak, even girls and peasant children, who had neither intention nor opportunity of ever pursuing an academic education, would gather past the university’s fences, wide-eyed in awe at his scholarly eloquence. \n\nSuch was the nature of Chanakya’s words – he made no effort to make them less erudite to be accessible to such audiences, yet he also made no effort to make them erudite beyond necessity out of a desire to impress more scholarly audiences.\n\nAnd as a consequence Chanakya had grown so confident in the effectiveness of *sama*, of persuasion alone, that his mind had become almost unable to imagine a man who *couldn’t* be convinced by the truth. Particularly instrumental in building this confidence in him had been his debate with Shribhanu, a Magadhi kshatriya student who was heavily influenced by a philosopher of his country contemporary to Ajatashatru.\n\n“Ambition is the cause of all suffering,” Shribhanu had said, “Hence my objection to your position that the pursuit of wealth is the noblest goal.”\n\n“I deny your premise,” Chanakya had replied, to which Shribhanu had explained:\n\n“It is his desire for wealth that causes a man to be unhappy in its absence; it is his desire for family that causes him to be unhappy in their death; it is his desire for women that causes him to be unhappy in abstinence. It is the mark of maturity to reject all such desires and ambitions, that is the principle of ascetism.”\n\nTo which Chanakya had said simply: “Then die.” \n\nAt Shribhanu’s offended expression, he had elaborated: “Why? Do you desire life? Surely it is the desire for life that causes a man to be unhappy at the prospect of death.”\n\n“I have no attachments towards life either,” Shribhanu had said indignantly. “But I also do not desire death.”\n\n“So you have no preference between life and death?”\n\n“Correct.”\n\n“And did you have any preference between life and death yesterday?”\n\n“I did not.”\n\n“And the day before?”\n\n“I did not.”\n\n“In all the days since your conversion to this philosophy, you will claim to never have had a preference between life and death,” Chanakya had observed. “Yet on each of these days, you and all the other adherents of your school chose life over death. I do not know much of the peculiarities of the Magadhas, but in Gandhara, if a housewife purchases groceries at the same shop each day, we say that she prefers that shop’s goods to that of others. If a king consistently purchases iron from the mines of the same country for his armoury, we say that he prefers that country’s mines to others. If a householder spends each night with one wife ignoring all others, we say that he prefers that wife to the rest.”\n\nChanakya had continued, before Shribhanu could come up with a reply: “It seems there is little I need to convince you of, kid, for you already agree with me. You already have preferences, desires, ambitions – I do not need to convince you of their merit, only that you need no convincing.”\n\nA mere concession from Shribhanu would not have made this debate stand out in Chanakya’s memory – but after his concession, Shribhanu had demonstrated his understanding of Chanakya’s argument by generalizing it thus:\n\n“Indeed,” he had said, his eyes lit up in realization, “That is a *contradiction*, isn’t it? In my very argument against desire, I had relied on the assumption that suffering was *undesirable*. Do you say, then, that it is impossible to be devoid of desire?”\n\nChanakya, expressionless, had turned to the audience. “The focus on suffering is a fallacy of all Magadhi philosophers, not only of whom my opponent honoured, but also of the many schools of the Ajivikas. It is childish to believe one can live without causing suffering at all, and if minimizing suffering, whether to others or to oneself, were the goal, then there are many methods to kill someone painlessly in their sleep. The very act of walking on the Earth causes pain to various insects and other beings that may dwell on its surface; yet it is righteous to do so, so long as the act leads to the creation of wealth. And thus I re-state my undefeated stance: that it is wealth and wealth alone that is important, and that suffering is only bad in so far as it harms one’s wealth, whether this wealth is in the form of one’s possessions, relations, knowledge or health.” \n\nThus Chanakya had won from the king, for Professor Chanaka, another herd of cows, each laden with heavy golden ornaments and various rare gems. \n\n(Professor Chanaka would complain that he was running out of space to house the cows, to which Chanakya had replied: that is the great joy of wealth, Professor, that it can be traded to other forms. You may sell the cows for more gold, which is easier to store, or you may sell their ornaments for more space to house them.)\n\nAnd for himself, he had won an immense excess of confidence in his own persuasive power – why, if he could in such short debate convince a boy of Magadhi noble lineage, who had spent his childhood living among barbarians and believing in barbarian philosophy, to abandon his deeply-held beliefs and adopt a diametrically opposite position, then, well, Chanakya ought to be deified as the *god of debate*.\n\nAnd it was in this confidence that Chanakya had marched into the empire of darkness, to the dwelling of the very source of that darkness, on a mission to *persuade* the Emperor of Magadha to change his ways.\n\nProfessor Chanaka had warned him of the dangers of visiting a state like Magadha that was so different from them in their ways, and that his charm may be ineffectual or even dangerous there. He had finally given his blessing, satisfied after rehearsing with Chanakya several possible scenarios that may come to result in the court of Pataliputra. But even Professor Chanaka had not foreseen *this*.\n\nNow deep in the Dungeons of Ajatashatru, Chanakya *thought*. \n\nIt was a dreadful feeling to await one’s death – whether announced by a king, a physician or a prophet. Suppressing panic, shock and all terrible emotions, Chanakya *thought*.\n\nThe prison system of Pataliputra had been designed by Ajatashatru a century and a half ago: it was physically impenetrable, from the outside and the inside, to men and to messages, by routes and tunnels or by physical force. No – the weakest spots in the fortification were not in its stones, they were in the *people* who guarded it. Any escape attempt, to have an appreciable chance of success, would need to exploit the psychological weaknesses of the guards.\n\n(Somewhere in the back of his mind, Chanakya was shocked at how clearly he was able to think in this state: not once was he enticed by the thought of giving up and accepting his death like Shribhanu would have implied, not once did he find that option appealing. Such was the nature of man: some primal instinct would kick in when one’s life was at stake, ridding the mind of foolish distractions, of romantic idealisms and of all squeamishness. A man possessed of sufficient intellect would in some way, with cold and calculating demeanour, loving nothing but his own life, caring for nothing the survival of his self, claw himself out of such a situation.)\n\nThe prisons employed a vast number of guards.\n\nLarge numbers provided security and fortification against a front invasion; but against slyer methods, each extra guard was an extra vulnerability.\n\nChanakya just had to find that vulnerability.\n\nHe had two days to do so.\n\nThe guards were staring at him.\n\nHe stared back.\n\n*Each guard was a door into a fortress.* \n\nHe just had to find out which one was compromised, for attacking a secure door would cost him his life.\n\n“Am I the first child you’ve seen submitted for execution?” he asked them.\n\nThe strength of a door could be tested by physical methods; the method to interact with a man’s mind was to speak with him.\n\n“The first?” one of them snorted, “Not even close.” \n\n“Usually they’re crying for their mothers,” said another one. “You’re the first to accept your own death so calmly.”\n\n*Look sad*. “I’m not one to accept my death so neutrally,” Chanakya said with a tender smile. “I love my life; it is dearer to me than anything else on Earth.”\n\nThe guards seemed unmoved by this. He noticed their tones in speech were all carefully neutral; expressing neither sympathy nor sadistic pleasure – as if they simply didn’t care. Chanakya needed to make a play that achieved three goals: (1) show the guards something *unique*, something that broke them out of their rut, so they didn’t view his execution as merely their job (2) cause the guards to befriend him and feel an immense responsibility to help him and (3) allowed him to understand the guards’ security flaws, both psychological and systemic.\n\nAnd Chanakya knew the perfect play.\n\n“You know what is second dearest to me, after my life?” he asked to no one in particular.\n\n“Your mother?” suggested one of the guards – Chanakya quickly studied his eyes and decided that the guard intended that question as an insult, rather than an expression of sympathy.\n\n“She died three years ago, and I lacked the wealth to so much as attend her funeral. And not my father either, for I never knew him.” Chanakya shook his sadly. “No, what I treasure most is—” \n\n“Knowledge!” exclaimed another guard – at the weird looks he got from the other guards, he quickly explained: “I’ve … heard people care about that sort of thing … Brahmins … in the conquered Western realms.”\n\nChanakya quickly noted this guard’s face for future use, then nodded, putting on a most meaningful expression. “To discover things, to learn things, to teach things … it is the noblest pursuit. That is all I wish for.” \n\nSome people believed that the art to manipulation was lying.\n\nThose people were wrong. The art to convincingly make people believe lies was to tell truths, things that you truly believed in, but by carefully picking which truths to speak, or by stringing those truths in a manner that apparently, but not truly, implied the lies you wished them to believe. This is because a true belief could be expressed with a conviction that a lie could not easily be, even if for dishonest purpose.\n\nFinally, the guard who had guessed correctly spoke up. “In this prison, even an inmate’s wish for a last meal isn’t satisfied. None of us can teach you anything, nor do we have the intellect to learn what you can teach us.”\n\n“There’s a game we play in Taxila,” said Chanakya, “It’s called *Rajamandala*, and we use it to teach students about many features of covert war, political alliance-making and the administration of justice. I believe that you could play it too. But the game requires six players; all five of you will need to play.”\n\n(In fact, Chanakya had developed his own version of the game that also taught economics: in this version, no players had any loyalties, the emperor had to purchase information from them. But this version was far too complicated, and served no additional purpose, to play with the guards.)\n\nIt took some convincing from the nice guard; perhaps it was out of intrigue, or boredom, or genuine sympathy for boy’s plight, but all four guards eventually acquiesced. \n\nHere are how the games approximately went, expressd in Chanakya’s first-person.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRAJAMANDALA \\[first recension\\]. \n\nPlay with at least six players. One player is appointed Emperor (*Samraat*), whose identity is known to everyone. The remaining players are vassal kings (*Rajas*), two of whom are spies (*Guptacharas*), known to each other but not to the Emperor or the other players, and the remaining are loyals (*Anuragas*). Each king publicly chooses a seal (*mudra*), which the Emperor keeps several copies of – each copy of a seal is labelled by numbers 1, 2, 3 … \n\nEach round, the following events occur:\n\n* Sleep (*nidra*): All players including the Emperor close their eyes.\n* Assignment (*niyoga*): Out of the seals, one of the spies’ seals is chosen.\n* Crime (*dosha*): The chosen spy opens his eyes and chooses a loyal to kill.\n* Observation (*sakshat*): Out of the remaining seals, half of them are chosen with replacement (so repetition is possible) and distributed among some random kings, functioning as alibis for that half.\n* Waking (*jagarana*): All players open their eyes, and the victim is revealed.\n* Interrogation (*sakshiprashna*): Kings tell the Emperor whom they can vouch for – a loyal will tell the truth based on the seal, if any, that he was given that night; a spy may lie or hide information.\n* Execution (*vadha*): The Emperor may decide to execute a king, or to show mercy until receiving more information.\n\nIt would hardly have been useful to demonstrate my own manipulation and cunning to the guards, thus I appointed myself emperor each game, claiming to the guards that it was by chance. It was my hope that this would cause them to superstitiously believe that I was some sort of chosen hero.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGame 1.

One of Rajastambha, Sarpamalin, Shasholaman is a spy (due to missing alibi).\n\nBehavioural observations: None.\n\nEmperor shows mercy.\n\nRound 2.\n\nVictim: Sulabhin.\n\nAlibis: Shasholaman for Rajastambha.\n\nInferences: One of Sarpamalin, Shasholaman is a spy. One of Rajastambha, Sarpamalin is a spy.\n\nBehavioural observations: The spy is taking my advice from the last game with regards to omitting self-incriminating evidence. Yet Rajastambha remains alive, despite being vouched for the previous round. While Sulabhin was an equally good target to kill, I do not believe the spy was clever enough to realize that I was also suspecting people on basis of the missing alibi. Upon interrogation, Rajastambha claimed: “I didn’t kill Sulabhin, I haven’t killed anyone.” I believe him; the dice have not given him the opportunity to kill yet. \n\nEmperor executes Rajastambha.\n\nRound 3 unnecessary as the surviving player would immediately be executed.\n\nLoyalist victory.\n\nTeachings: *Omitting information also makes you suspicious, decide wisely; more generally behave as a loyal would, make a full-fledged story that you yourself can believe.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nGame 3. Emperor: Chanakya. \n\nRound 1.\n\nVictim: Suhavis.\n\nAlibis: Rajastambha for Sulabhin. Sulabhin for Rajastambha. Sarpamalin for Rajastambha.\n\nInference: *One of Sarpamalin, Shasholaman is a spy OR Rajastambha, Sulabin are both spies.

Rajastambha made an honest effort to learn what I taught him, even though his own attempts to execute failed. The latter fact demonstrates that he was not motivated by scholarly purpose, but by sympathy towards me. From his accent, he is not a native of Magadha, and is likely of Mathura; he is also of immense raw strength, which may be useful in close combat. Sarpamalin and Shasholaman are of no use to me.* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Author’s Note:** Just to be clear, “Rajamandala” isn’t an actual recorded game from ancient literature; it’s just a monarchist version of Mafia (or more accurately Among Us, because of the in-game information source). I have no idea how playable it actually is (i.e. whether it is too skewed towards the loyals or spies); presumably it would require some tweaks to the parameters.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire.

The Centre’s counsel submitted that counselling will not commence till the top court decides the case on reservation for EWS-OBC quota in the All India Quota Medical Seats.\n\n&gt;Senior advocate Arvind Datar mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.\n\n&gt;Datar submitted that the counselling schedule has been announced — from October 24 and it will be concluded on October 29 — and sought the court’s intervention in the matter stating that the process will be completed during the pendency of the matter before the court.\n\n&gt;The apex court had questioned the Centre on the rationale behind fixing Rs 8 lakh as annual income criteria for EWS. Following Datar’s submissions, the bench directed the Centre not to go ahead with the counselling process until it decides the matter. The bench is slated to hear the matter on October 28.\n\n&gt;On October 21, the top court had questioned the Centre over adopting the criteria of the OBC creamy layer of Rs 8 lakh annual income for granting reservations under the economic weaker section (EWS), despite the latter not suffering from social and educational backwardness.\n\n&gt;The court told Centre’s counsel, “You just cannot pull out eight lakh from thin air. You are making unequal equal by applying the Rs eight lakh limit”.\n\nIt noted that for OBCs, people who are below the eight lakh annual income criteria, they suffer from social and educational backwardness. It added, “Under the constitutional scheme, the EWS category is not socially and educationally backward”.\n\nhttps://hindupost.in/education/ews-obc-quota-sc-tells-centre-to-put-on-hold-neet-pg-counselling-centre-agrees/'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'qgrurs'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qgrurs/is_justice_chandrachud_claiming_impoverished/</li>

The amount being huge, we were also provided with a life insurance, for all the borrowers listed.\n\nAs this is a life insurance, it should cover the loan amount in case of death of the borrower. We signed the insurance and my father passed away after some years from the loan approval date due to cancer.\n\nUpon applying for claim we found out that the insurance policies were changed internally by the bank for all 4 borrowers and replaced with a general insurance that does cover the loan. Upon multiple attempts we recieved the insurance applications for the general insurance and we found the signatures were forged and we also verified it with the help of a renowned graphologist (you can literally say it by looking without having a graphologist say it, but that's the procedure).\n\nWe engaged the lawyers and tried to file a complaint but it took 2 months for the officers to register it. Then now it's been another month, and yet we are awaiting the officers to file an FIR. Upon following up, the cop just says this takes time and we are investigating and MF hangs up.\n\nCommon men literally have no fail safe for themselves using which they can corner a cop if they are being treated incorrectly. A cop can straight up abuse you, threaten you, avoid work, use their power for incorrect shit and yet a commoner can't do anything but simply be at their mercy.\n\nCops are shitty (in most cases) in all countries but atleast the 1st world nations have body cams that can be used as proofs against the cop but what have Indians got for themselves? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I think instead of building metros, statues, renovating government houses, the authorities should first build a strong structure for the law and order where a commoner can feel safe and confident. And then improve and fix the basic facilities like roads, street lamps, garbage disposers at equal intervals, decommission old vehicles that emit huge amounts of smoke, healthcare facilities, education facilities, etc.\n\nBeing a commoner, isn't really reassuring. Have had many bad experiences in the past years, to such an extent that nothing could change my opinion."<br />Author: 'wollowitzz'  id: 'qgopyk'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qgopyk/the_cop_system_needs_a_good_revamp/</li>

Its important to realize where its coming from and what its meant to achieve. \n\n\nAn American professor recently asked: "One question raised by the woke movement, though hardly ever asked, **is whether the U.S. will be able to deploy this new intellectual tool for exporting American cultural influence**. Put another way: If there is going to be an international progressive class, why not Americanize it?"\n\nWokeism is an idea that can be adapted to virtually every country: Identify a major form of oppression in a given region or nation, argue that people should be more sensitive to it, add some rhetorical flourishes, purge some wrongdoers (and a few innocents) and voila — you have created another woke movement.\n\nPaul Skallas has written: “**MeToo and BlackLivesMatter are essentially US culture issues which provide an effective identity for internationals of the progressive class.**” Almost every other country now has its own version of woke, though it may differ greatly from the American version.\n\nA British prof wrote that Wokeness is the successor ideology of neo-conservatism, a singularly American world-view. That may be why it has become a powerful force only in countries (such as Britain and India) heavily exposed to American culture wars. In much of the rest of the world however such as other Asian and Islamic countries and large parts of Europe, for example — the woke movement is marginal, and its American prototype viewed with bemused indifference or contempt.\n\nIn the US you might be surprised to know that Wokeism is stronger in the **private sector**. In India too its the private sector (see the advertising from companies) that is most woke. \n\nAnd even in America **it does not do what it\'s supposed to**: help the marginalized. Rather its a way for corporations to virtue signal while continue doing what they do. \n\nAn African American professor observes, that in a matter of years, a fringe ideology formerly limited to universities has swept through corporations, churches, schools, and federal and state governments. Addressing himself to readers half-convinced of this ideology’s truth, he argues that wokeness is harmful to the very people it purports to help.\n\n**Wokeness in the US is now being compared to a cult or religion**, questioning it is no longer allowed and we are heading in that direction.'<br />Author: 'dhatura'  id: 'qffk90'<br />Score:54<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qffk90/on_wokeness_and_the_empty_gesture_of_bending_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Waiting for local bus....'<br />Body: "Hello people of IndiaSpeaks!. So a few days ago I was waiting for a local bus in the morning and I overheard some highschool students talking about how the they have been waiting for 40-45 minutes for the bus and they are going to be late for their morning assembly.This must have been a regular issue since there is a railway crossing on that road and all. So I had a thought that why isn't there a tracking app for local government bus like that for trains in indian railways? Hence most of the government bus drivers or conductors have smart phones nowadays,They just have to make an app to track where their location is on duty, and they can turn it off when they are not on the move or are done with their day. It would also increase their profits because people would choose bus over other modes of travel due to the added convenience. Which might also decrease the pollution level a little bit. And also save hours of those students lives and people who depend on this bus as their daily mode of travel. So i wanted to know why this hasn't been implemented yet because i can't be the first person to have this idea, right? Is there a reason why it wouldn't work?? If it is a good idea then I hope someone appreciate would see this...😊😊"<br />Author: 'Open-Mood9109'  id: 'qen5wv'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qen5wv/waiting_for_local_bus/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Am I only one who believes India should be cozy with USA very much?'<br />Body: 'The recent geopolitics development have seen India and USA being closer but I and people I came across with did not like Indo-USA getting closer. I wanna present my hypothesis and get assessment from compatriots present here and reason I feel that way:-\n\n**1)** US started supported Pakistan over India in the 50s because John Foster Dulles found the "Abrahamic faith and discipline" of its General Ayub Khan far more appealing than the "weak-willed Hindu culture" of Nehru. He also thought that the Gurkhas fought in the Pakistani army when he decided to support them. When told by the State Dept. officials that they fought for the Indian army, Dulles remarked, "No worries. We\'ll get them to fight on our side."\n\n**2)** US support to Pakistan in the 1965 War.\n\n**3)** US tacit support to Pakistan\'s army in the 1970-71 Hindu genocide in East Pakistan. About 500,000 to 1,500,000 million Hindu civilians were killed by by the West Pakistan dominated Pak army because they voted overwhelmingly for an East Pakistani political party. The (West) Pakistani incumbent government refused to recognize the electoral victory of the (Bangladeshi) Awami League and imposed marital law in East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Approximately 100,000 women were raped, and India was flooded by about 3,000,000 refuges.\n\n**4)** US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. India decided to step into the East Pakistan genocide situation after Pakistan attacked India in a premptive Operation Chengiz Khan. Nixon decided to stop India from stopping the genocide by sending in a nuclear armed USS Enterprise and supporting British naval fleets. They only backed off after realizing that the USSR was tailing them with a nuclear submarine in the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**5)** Nixon\'s sanctions on India for not "allowing those scummy Indians and that evil bitch (Indira Gandhi) get away with what they did in East Pakistan."\n\n**6)** US sanctions for India\'s 1974 nuclear tests.\n\n**7)** US support of the Afghan Mujaheddin against the soviets in the 1980s. The US left a battle hardened Mujaheddin and plenty of arms in Afghanistan. Pakistan\'s ISI used these Mujaheddin to step up infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir. These Mujaheddin used to travel freely betwen Afghanistan and Kashmir through Pakistan\'s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province under the ISI\'s patronage.\n\n**8)** US financial support for Pakistan\'s security establishment which used these funds to support terror camps in Kashmir. Terrorists infiltrated the LoC to engage in the massacre of Hindu Kashmiri Pandits. This resulted in 150,000 to 350,000 Pandits becoming refugees in their own country between the years 1988 and 1995.\n\n**9)** US sanctions on India for conducting the 1998 nuclear tests.\n\n**10)** US support (financial and weapons) to Pakistan in the Kargil War. The US even turned off GPS signals for the Indian army during the war.\n\n**11)** More recently, the 2005 Modi visa ban has also caused major issues. Modi imposed certain restrictions on anti-Hindu propaganda used by missionaries to convert poor, uneducated tribal people in his state of Gujarat. An unprecedented combination of evangelical, Islamic, and left-wing ex-pat Indian groups lobbied with the Bush administration to use the protection of religious freedom act (that was only used once - against Modi) to impose a preemptive ban on Modi. Of course, the reason cited was "Modi\'s involvement in the 2002 Gujarat riots" but the real reason (restricting missionary propaganda) was never cited. Forget being found guilty for aiding/abetting the riots, the Supreme Court of India didn\'t even find enough evidence to convict Modi of ignoring his duty during the riots. Despite the Supreme Court\'s clean chit, the US didn\'t bother to overturn the visa ban undermining the authority of the Indian judicial system. Meanwhile, the US hobnobbed with mass murders, despots, and theocratic-authoritarian heads of state.\n\n**12)** Hillary\'s use of European human-rights NGOs as a front to find "mass graves of Muslims" in Gujarat to implicate Modi between the years 2009 and 2012. The mass graves were found. But the bones collected as "evidence" turned out to be buffalo bones.\n\n**How US studies India and itself:**\n\nThe US/West has a fundamentally different approach towards viewing itself and India.\n\nIt views itself from a top down approach - Starting from a study of the American state (constitution, government, etc), moving on to a study of American nationalism (revolution, civil war, world wars), moving on to a study of American cultural theology (white man\'s burden, manifest destiny, Christian theology), and finally onto problems in American society (racism, sexism, immigration, treatment of religious minorities).\n\nHowever, it views India (go to any India-studies class in the US) from a bottom-up approach - Starting from problems in Indian society (treatment of women, Dalits, religious minorities), ascribes these problems to Hinduism and Hindu theology (caste system, Hindu patriarchy, upper caste "chauvinism"), which is considered the fundamental block of Indian nationalism (Hindutva, wars against Pakistan) and the Indian state (constitution, government, etc).\n\nThe top-down approach gives Americans a holistic picture of their own society. Where as the bottom-up approach gives Americans a completely distorted picture of Indian society. The problems in American society are considered flaws where as the problems in India society are considered features.\n\nAnd America uses this world view to embarrass India on global forum, proposing that India needs the West to "save Indians from India". What this does is it makes Indians (especially Indian-origin Americans or "Westernized" Indians) ashamed of being Indians/Hindus. Plenty of them not only reject Hinduism and Indian-ness but they also end up spewing hared towards themselves in order to appear "modern", "civilized", and "acceptable" to their American brethren.'<br />Author: 'king_bardock'  id: 'qe2hyx'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qe2hyx/am_i_only_one_who_believes_india_should_be_cozy/</li>

They have a common narrative that we will win because our soldiers and officers have better training. \n\nI personally feel that Chinese PLA is very capable (and huge) force and should not be underestimated. Germans during WWII assumed USSR would collapse because they considered Red army as cowards and Soviet people as low life. Pakistan (1965)  considered Indian people as weak (because we were kafirs) and in both cases people with superiority complex lost. I feel some Indians have same superiority complex towards Chinese army.\n\nMany Indians say that Chinese PLA isn't tested but isn't Indian Air force and Indian Navy untested too since 1999 war (air force) and navy since 1971. Heck , IAF is in so bad condition that it still uses the vintage flying coffins Mig 21 which are retired long ago. Also a lot of IAF plane crashes are due to pilot errors and technical malfunction.\n\nChina also outperforms in technical and supply lines.

This is characterized by one\'s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.\n\n\nPURPORT\n\nBy practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or samādhi which means that the yogī realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Patañjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patañjali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patañjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure-realized through transcendental senses-is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Patañjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sūtras: puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.\n\nThis citi-śakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruṣārtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the Supreme" is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Patañjali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This "clearance" is actually liberation, or bhava-mahādāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. The theory of nirvāṇa-also preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the Bhāgavatam this is called svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. The Bhagavad-gītā also confirms this situation in this verse.\n\nAfter nirvāṇa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of the Bhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: this is the "real life of the living entity." Māyā, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti. This citi-śakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Vedānta-sūtras as ānandamayo \'bhyāsāt. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā.\n\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of samādhi, called samprajñāta-samādhi and asamprajñāta-samādhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called samprajñāta-samādhi. In the asamprajñāta-samādhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogī is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yogī is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\'s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yogī indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogīs who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yogīs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\n\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, and jñāna-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\n\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, āgamāpāyino \'nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata. He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.\n\nQuestion 1 : What is the real purpose of the Patañjali system of yoga ? Why the monists do not accept it ?\n\nQuestion 2 : How a Kṛṣṇa conscious person performs duties of his occupation ?\n\n[Bhagavad Gita 6.20-23](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/6/20-23)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'qdja7o'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qdja7o/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is62023/</li>

Our team investigated the biggest Hinduphobic scandal in Dartmouth’s history.'<br />Body: 'THREAD: Did you know that a student filed a complaint against Hindu professors at @dartmouth just bc they were Hindu?\n\nDidn’t hear about it? Our team investigated the biggest Hinduphobic scandal in Dartmouth’s history.\n\n#Hinduphobia #AcademicTwitter\n\ndartmouth.edu/provost/pdfs/1…\n1/ First and foremost, while we recognize that the details of the case are sensitive and centered around sexual harassment, this will not be the focus of the thread.\n\nSo, what happened? \n2/ Maha Hasan Alshawi was a graduate student at Dartmouth College.\n\nIn February 2020, Alshawi met with Dartmouth’s Deputy Title IX Coordinator Gary Sund and Title IX Coordinator Kristi Clemens to report an alleged incident of sexual harassment. \nShe had reported that her research advisor, Professor Li, “touched his private area inappropriately” for 20 to 30 seconds.\n\nThe professor denied the allegations and maintained that at the time of the alleged incident he was in Macau, China and Washington, D.C. for conferences. \n3/ Alshawi was also one of Professor Prasad Jayanti’s TAs for an undergraduate course, CS 31.\n\nIn March 2020, Alshawi sought permission from Professor Jayanti, to enroll in CS 231, an advanced graduate course, based on having served as a TA for CS 31. \n4/ Since the semester had elapsed already, Prof Jayanti offered to administer the course’s final exam to “assess [Alshawi’s] own readiness to take CS 231.”\n\nBased on her performance, Prof Jayanti advised that Alshawi take CS 31 for credit before attempting the graduate course. \nAlshawi disputed Prof Jayanti’s assessment &amp; alleged that he had prevented her from taking CS 231 as retaliation for the investigation she had launched against her colleague. \n4/ Alshawi further alleged that such actions were made on the basis of her religion and thus constituted discrimination.\n\nShe also made allegations against two other computer science faculty members, Professors Amit Chakrabarti and Deeparnab Chakrabarty. \n5/ On April 9, Alshawi submitted an official complaint to Dean Kull with her concerns about Professors Jayanti &amp; Chakrabarti\n\nOn June 9, Alshawi made a Facebook post alleging “abuse of power” by Jayanti wherein he had “unfairly failed her on an CS 31 exam”\n\nSign the Petition\nOpen investigations on sexual misconduct and retaliation against a Dartmouth grad student\nhttps://www.change.org/p/open-investigations-on-maha-hasan-alshawi-s-sexual-misconduct-and-retaliation-complaints\n6/ On June 16, she filed a complaint with Dartmouth’s Institutional Diversity and Equity Office (IDE) through its director, Antonio Ferrantino\n\nDartmouth first conducted an internal inquiry into these-- among other-- allegations and found that the professors had not “violated.. \n...any professional obligation or Dartmouth policy.”\n\nWhen presented with the findings on June 28, Alshawi disputed that the investigation was fair and began a hunger strike on July 14 demanding a second investigation.\n\n\nGraduate student’s sexual harassment allegations and hunger strike: A timeline\nOn June 9, computer science Ph.D. student Maha Hasan Alshawi alleged in a Facebook post that she had been sexually harassed by her supervisor and unfairly failed on an exam by the department chair in …\nhttp://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2020/09/graduate-student-sexual-harassment-allegations-and-hunger-strike-timeline\n7/ Following intense public pressure, Dartmouth College Registrar &amp; Assistant Dean for the Guarini School of Graduate &amp; Advanced Studies, Gary Hutchins, began an e-mail correspondence with Alshawi in which he offered an external investigation into her claims of misconduct. \n8/ So, what were Maha’s claims? \n9/ In her interview with Dartmouth’s IDE director Antonio Ferrantino, Alshawi revealed that “she believed that Hindus like seeing Muslims tortured” and she therefore believed the Hindu faculty members were “abusing” her.\nImage\nBecause Alshawi never presented any specific allegations against Professor Deeparnab Chakrabarty, Ferrantino prompted Alshawi to divulge the particular allegations she was making against him.\n\nAlshawi responded, in an e-mail dated 30 June 2020, \n“As I said before, Professor Jayanti, Professor Amit [Chakrabarti], Professor Deeparnab [Chakrabarty], and Student 3 all belong to the same religion, and they are all friends and colleagues.”\n\nSame religion = Hindu\nImage\n10/ Ferrantino concluded, “[Alshawi] believes she was abused and harassed because she was Muslim and he was Hindu, but she didn’t provide specifics.” \nThus, her basis for complaining against at least one of the faculty members, Professor Chakrabarty, was merely that he also happened to be Hindu and a colleague of Professor Jayanti. \n11/ Alshawi reported, “I have been told that Prof. Prasad Jayanti belongs to an Anti Muslim organization called RSS, and he also failed me in his course as a retaliation of reporting a sexual harassment incident [against Li].”\nImage\n12/ As Ferrantino recounts, “The allegation that was investigated is very specific--- she believes Student 3 was working as Prasad [Jayanti]’s agent and was directed to ask about her religion. She believes Prasad was a member of a Hindu group [the RSS].” \n13/ On June 29, a University investigator concluded that “IDE had jurisdiction to inquire on the following: \n&gt; That Professor Jayanti is a member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and he had an animus towards Ms. Hasan, for being a Muslim.\n\n&gt; That Professor Jayanti had instructed Student 3, his graduate student, to speak with Ms. Hasan and inquir[e] about her religion. \n14/ Alshawi claimed she “was told this and found out by someone from India.”\n\nHowever, she did not share who told her this, merely that like Professor Jayanti, they were from India.\nImage\n15/ Alshawi also linked reduced communication with Professor Jayanti’s daughter (also a computer science graduate student) and Student 3, his graduate student, following her various complaints to the professor’s attempts to isolate her within the department because she was Muslim \n16/ Later written notes taken by Ferrantino show that on July 10, 2020, Professor Jayanti was asked to discuss his religious affiliation as part of the investigation. He replied that he was Hindu. \nIn a later interview with Cozen O’Connor, he also recounted as part of his biographical details that he had served as the faculty advisor for Dartmouth’s Hindu student organization, Shanti, and thereby was also the Hindu minister on Dartmouth’s United Campus Ministries (UCM). \nProf Jayanti denied being a member of the RSS. He stated that even if he had been, he still “would have continued to treat Maha fairly, regardless of her religion.” \nHe denied asking any students to speak with Alshawi about her religion; Student 3 also denied being approached by Jayanti for any such undertaking or doing it on their own. \n17/ A post on Twitter made in response to @justice4mahahasan went so far as to call Professor Jayanti, “abusive Hindutva scum.” (see below)\nImage\n18/ On July 26, Prof Jayanti sent communication from unknown persons speaking on Alshawi’s behalf via e-mail and Twitter that he considered to be threatening in nature, to the Hanover Police Department. \n19/ A summary of the situation: A student filed a complaint against a Hindu professor for no other reason other than “Hindus love to see Muslims tortured” and that he came from an Indian background. \nThis cascaded into a witch hunt of Hindu professors and students who were harassed, intimidated and threatened with violence. \n20/ Dartmouth college’s campus atmosphere is hostile towards Hindus. In March 2020, @Students_A_H held a Holi Against Hindutva protest at Dartmouth College.\n\nWell... only 5 students showed up (😂) We are sure that’s a huge success lmaooo 😉\n\n\n21/ We call on Dartmouth to end its witch hunt of Hindu students and professors.'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'qdfk0r'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qdfk0r/hinduoncampus_did_you_know_that_a_student_filed_a/</li>

The left in this stage were the ones who dominated the YouTube 2008 hemisphere.\n\nI'll take myself as an example. And it'd be really helpful if people could tell me if their experiences match mine.\n\n**The Early Years: 2008 to 2011**\n\nIn 2008-11, the Young Turks of Cenk/Ana was the channel that was my first exposure to American Media. At this point in time, the channel was still something that one would call outside of the traditional mainstream media. You did not have right-wing channels at that point in time and for someone who was born in India, the discussions taking place were absolutely eye-opening.\n\nIn fact, the only similar channel I can think of is Sargon of Akkad, who was of similar mold to the Young Turks.\n\nJesse Ventura was the guy who I looked up to and Bill' O Riley/ Beck were the guys who were the butt of jokes esp the Riley guy for the way he conducted his interviews.\n\nVentura's conspiracy theory videos at that time were somewhat of an obsession to me. He and Alex Jones had a treasure trove of videos on all the conspiracies under the sun.\n\nAnd you know the shocking thing: All those videos are gone today.\n\nTill this time, the left was whom I identified with and I sided with them on issues like torture, healthcare, and socialism ( boy that changed, and I'll explain why in a minute.)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoFfVQPSIOQ&amp;t=263s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoFfVQPSIOQ&amp;t=263s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14-A4yqBc0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14-A4yqBc0I)\n\nThese were the kinda videos that made me fall in love with the Young Turks and esp Ventura ( he was an absolute rage in that period, with talks of people wanting to vote for him if he ran elections)\n\nThe only distinct negations I had with the left was on the topic of islam. Remember at this point I'd still be what one would call a cultural leftist and possibly a socialist ( I kick myself thinking about it now) But even during those days, I just could not for the life of me get why the left while criticizing Christianity would find gob shit excuses while discussing the life of prophet mohdawg.\n\nThe excuses then were 1.) America was a Christian Majority and it is Republicans who are oppressing people. Que citing a long list of crimes against blacks, women and showing pictures of dead Iraqis.\n\nNow the wonderful thing about the Internet and Youtube then is you had access to Iraqi liberals/seculars and could get an opposing view, but their points were never even taken into consideration.\n\n[https://www.memri.org/tv/iraqi-mp-iyad-jamal-al-din-criticizes-concept-islamic-state-and-says-iraqis-should-be-grateful-us](https://www.memri.org/tv/iraqi-mp-iyad-jamal-al-din-criticizes-concept-islamic-state-and-says-iraqis-should-be-grateful-us)\n\nSomehow this guy and many others like him( yes they do exist ) who should have been the ones being listened to were ignored and who were given platforms, far-right islamist scums like Linda Sarsour and Mehdi Hasan ( both darlings of the anti-trump media today.)\n\nI distinctly remember there were no discussions on gender, pronouns, and all that nonsense.\n\nHowever, a couple of friends of mine who were on the right even then used to always tell me there was a media bias and I never believed them. I'll just use the examples of 2 videos to illustrate why they might have been accurate in their observations.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HECI4QK\\_mXA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HECI4QK_mXA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxpSmUZLmfQ&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxpSmUZLmfQ&amp;t=3s)\n\nOne more not so good example: Not a fan of this bloke, Watch this video esp from min 3:00 onwards: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXeWKq6ids&amp;t=243s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDXeWKq6ids&amp;t=243s) he raises the same point\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still hate the American War Industry and do think it has played a pivotal role in chaos and anarchy not just in ME but even in regime changes across South America, but the bias can be seen in the 2 videos I mentioned above.\n\n**2011 -2014 Phase 2: The shift from left to right of the political spectrum**\n\nBut things changed and as the Internet replaced the medium of Television, more and more people became aware that the ideology of communism and socialism were the ones that lead to misery and poverty.\n\nAt least in my case exposure to guys like Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell and the big-time dynamite Ayn Rand ( what an absolute game-changer she was) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZu0HcsjG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZu0HcsjG4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\\_PQlX9NDL0&amp;t=172s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_PQlX9NDL0&amp;t=172s)\n\nThese two videos along with examples of what I personally saw in my country that is the impact of free-market competition causing growth is what made me shift towards economic liberalization.\n\nNow India is a strange country, the left in this country have for the lack of a better word aped the American Wokeism without achieving any of the economic success the West has.\n\nAnd if u think the American left is bad in their alliance with the islamists, our lot have not just gone to bed with them but have prostituted the whole country to their whims and fancies and that includes changing and altering the secular constitution where in personal sharia laws are incorporated into the law which allows Polygamy/ Triple Talaq to be legal only for muslim men.\n\nand if anyone wants to know more: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEy3AkMWXcg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEy3AkMWXcg)\n\nThis was from 2008-2011- possibly stretching to 2014. The voices of the Right were rising and even in my country the Urban population was gravitating towards the free market and calling out on the bullshit alliance of islam.\n\nVentura had stopped and retired I guess, but Alex Jones was going strong. Never mentioned in the mainstream media but had a couple of interviews, one with Piers Morgan discussing the gun laws.\n\nAnd I'm really sorry if I sound insensitive and god knows, how many of you lot here remember but there were 2 videos which have all but disappeared not just from YouTube/Social media but even from the public memeory\n\n1.) Building 7 collapse 2.) The reaction of the parents, DON't remember his name but the guy was a father to one of the kids killed in Sandy Hook and was practically smiling before reading a statement to the media.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I would never mention this in public domain, but I still remember the feeling of creepiness that came when I watched that guy.\n\nThis is gonna get folks riled up here, and the sheer nature of the crime( little kids involved) make them attack me calling me insensitive, but remember guys, the black man was lynched when he was accused of hurting little kids.\n\nThe point being: Accuse or frame someone of hurting kids and you could tear them apart, lynch them or murder them and have the backing of the entire community.\n\nIn the same period, Islam was still the ideology left defended in the garb of protecting minorities so much so that [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAvRj6BQ0AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAvRj6BQ0AM)\n\nI'll just leave it here, just go through the comments to get the idea.

It was a cesspool of cultural marxists\n\nBut this was where I could feel the impact taking place. Buzzfeed is what I'd call the first mind-control website. The young ones were getting attracted to, and the reason I call it so folks in India who did not have the same exposure as me, were sprouting the same lingo as American Wokes.\n\nBear in mind with this is without us having achieved any economic liberalization or progress.\n\nAnd this was when the Young Turks completely lost me as a viewer, why? cause of their stance on islam\n\nWatch the video of Sam Harris giving an interview to Cenk, I literally wanted to slam my head listening that that moron, blabber on and on and this was the first time I began to understand why my friends were right when they told me about the damn leftist way of debate.

But still had courage in giving his views. His Pizzagate/Bohemian Grove videos are all but gone and as of 2021, the topic is in a state where I never imagined it would reach.\n\n**2018-2021 the total takeover of the cultural Marxists/ islamists**\n\nThe arrival of the blue ticked concept on both YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe painful irony.

      <li>Title::: 'It seems BJP will withdraw the farm laws for an alliance with Amarinder and (a) farmer parties.'<br />Body: "Recently I watched the OffTheCuff interview with Amarinder Singh. The interview was pretty good and aspects of national security were also discussed. The issue of alliance with BJP was brought up multiple times and I have to say frankly: The casual and direct nature of Amarinder on the same really surprised me. Amarinder as a politician and person has always been very direct in interviews but this seemed a lot more than normal that it almost seems that an agreement with BJP is a certainty. \n\nAround the 39.00 minute mark of the interview Amarinder throws around the grouping of himself+BJP+farmer parties. This is of course a strong possibility: BJP drags the issue until the last moment before elections then allow the farmers to claim victory and then encourages them to wipe out Congress and AAP in Punjab. Amarinder/farmer parties claim victory in the driver's seat while BJP gets consolation seats (it will get 0 as of now given the mood) and BJP also gets to engineer fragmentation of Congress and AAP to assert itself as the only strong party. Personally, I dont think it will work, like with Shah Bano people never vote for parties that course correct after causing an initial grievance. Amit Shah has tried other grandiose strategies in the past as well only to see them fall flat embarrasingly like in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.\n\nThe report by Gulati etc not coming to forefront in SC (which is likely due to BJP staying it not milords), inaction in law and order and countless other small signs make it seem that BJP is going to do exactly that.\n\nI do hope this does not happen. I have always been a cynic and have grown even more cynical of politicians as my adult years have gone by but BJP seemed to be the less worse of the lot, probably due to their association with RSS, new to the game and primarily made of middle class politicians and supporters. The farm reforms are a bitter medicine but a medicine India's agri sector desparately needs. But it seems unfortunately that BJP is going to withdraw/make them ineffective for politics.

      <li>Title::: "Just on a lark, I did some 'original research' about the recruitment of teachers in India."<br />Body: "Education is with the state governments. So I just picked Karnataka for this 'study'.\n\nState governments recruit teachers for the schools they run using the PET/TET tests. Note that this test is hiring teachers who will teach the millions of students from age 5-17 years in state school. The teachers are basically creating the next generation of citizens. So what is the quality of teachers that are hired by the government?\n\nIn Karnataka, the previous test was conducted in 2016. It had a question paper with 150 marks, and there were about 5 sections/topics with 30 marks each.\n\nFor general category ( which is less than 50% of seats, means less or about 50% of the seats were general category), the cutoff was 115.\n\nFor OBC, which would be about 27% of seats, the cutoff was 105.\n\nFor SC, which would have about 15% seats, the cutoff was 60 marks Means, that rather than hire a general category candidate who scored 114 marks, the state government rather hired a SC candidate who got only 60 marks. And these are the teachers who are supposed to go ahead and teach the students.\n\nBut wait for the zinger, the cutoff for ST was just 55! So rather than hire a so called 'general category' candidate with 114/150 marks, the government hired someone who only scored 55/150 just cause they had a ST caste certificate!\n\nNow you will ask me, what's my point? My point is I just love my country. Our scheme to make SC/ST/OBC/trans/Maratha/EWS/Jat etc successful at the cost of better education to our kids, is fucking genius!\n\nAs a nation, no one can stop India. India is definitely going to be vishwa Guru. Keep them coming, the SC/ST etc with lower than lowest marks, and lets keep making the teachers, doctors etc.\n\nreference [1](https://examluck.com/org/result/karnataka-tet-results-kar-tet-cut-off-marks-scores/216/41), [2](https://www.mockbank.com/bulletin/karnataka-tet-cut-off/)"<br />Author: 'parakite'  id: 'qc7c50'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qc7c50/just_on_a_lark_i_did_some_original_research_about/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Didn't know Modern Science is such a big fraud and that ancient Bharat beats modernity even in this!"<br />Body: "I had my doubts ever since I became anti-Leftists whether Modern Science, which is completely western, is actually a good description of the world or not. 'Rationalists' and 'Skeptics' usually claim how Modern Science like Astronomy, Astrophysics, Medical Science, etc. triumphs Indian Science and calls our ancient wisdom 'superstitions by savages'. Yet, reality seems to be otherwise. Ngl, Science was the only thing that kept me a centrist for so long - that no matter what, I believe people in politics, like right and left wing, have simply got the Science wrong. Clearly, Science is superior to our ancient primitive knowledge, right? Wrong.\n\nDharmapedia, a Wiki made for Dharma, exposes all these.\n\nhttps://en.dharmapedia.net/wiki/Big_Pharma\n\n&gt; Richard Horton (The Lancet) said: Journals have devolved into information laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry. The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.\n\n&gt; Robert Yoho wrote, The “big five” most respected medical journals, Lancet, JAMA, BMJ, NEJM, and Annals of Internal Medicine, are all contaminated with this commercial bias. \n\n&gt; Nortin Hadler wrote in The Citizen Patient (2013): “It turns out that the vast majority of the clinical literature is so lacking in methodological quality as to offer no contribution of substance to clinical decision making. For most clinical questions, one is fortunate to find a dozen studies that can be deemed informative.” \n\nBasically, Modern medical Science knows nothing compared to the vast knowledge of our ancient Dharmic sages. The only thing Liberals and Leftists can do is laugh at us, but in the end, we are the ones who will be laughing at them.\n\n&gt; Vaccine manufacturers are the least regulated, and most protected by federal legislation of Big Pharma companies. Vaccine manufacturers are so powerful that the FDA allows them to test vaccines without using placebo-controlled clinical trials. If you’re injured by a vaccine, you cannot sue the manufacturer. Instead, you must sue the federal government in a special vaccine court which functions like a kangaroo court\n\nTruth about vaccines.\n\nThen we have: https://en.dharmapedia.net/wiki/The_Lancet, the biggest medical journal in the world.\n\n&gt; Dr. Horton recently published a statement declaring that a lot of published research is in fact unreliable at best, if not completely false.\n\n&gt;&gt; “The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.”\n\nAll the medicines we have been running for...most of them are simply pseudo-medicine.\n\nIn another news, reincarnation is starting to be taken seriously https://uvamagazine.org/articles/the_science_of_reincarnation.\n\nOnce reincarnation is proved true, that would mean Puranas are true, and modern cosmology, like medical science, is all fraud.\n\nIf you think Maths is better, since it depends on rigorous proofs, think again. C K Raju https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Raju is exposing how the way mathematical proofs work is just Catholic propaganda...meaning there is a possibility that Calculus, Discrete Maths, etc. are all BS.\n\nWith time, I believe, everything in modern science will fall apart. There are some 'classical liberals' in the Hindutva movement who still sticks to western Science.

I believe most here do not support this kind of treatment of people. \n\nWeaknesses will be exploited and turning our eyes away from them does not make them go away. \n\nFor example the anti-India, anti-Hindu organization, Indian American Muslim Council, is using this to spread hate and misinformation about Hindus around the world. \n\nSee: https://twitter.com/IAMCouncil/status/1450868761226104840\n\nThey amplify the voices of others like [Sunita Viswanath](https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1DXxyDwgYQvJM) and [Jeboraja Singh](https://twitter.com/IAMCouncil/status/1450855444826624006).\n\nThey organized a [briefing today](https://twitter.com/IAMCouncil/status/1450462618192424974/photo/1) on this.

Leaving aside the irony of a Muslim body talking about caste to Americans, this is problematic because such distinctions are lost on Americans to whom, all Indians are Indians. And the dalit lobby has succeeded in equating the dalit case to that of African American slavery and rights. \n\nHindus were sleeping while this new problem was being engineered over the last many years. \n\n\n\nBut we need to also be aware that there is a problem here.

A perfect yogī is so well disciplined in the activities of the mind that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material desire. This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (9.4.18-20):\n\nsa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānavarṇanekarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu śrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-liṅgālaya-darśane dṛśau tad-bhṛtyagātra-sparśe \'ṅga-saṅgamamghrāṇaṁ ca tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śrīmat tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpitepādau hareḥ kṣetra-padānusarpaṇe śiro hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandanekāmaṁ ca dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottama-śloka-janāśrayā ratiḥ\n\n"King Ambarīṣa first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flower offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasī leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."\n\nThis transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcanā, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general-especially those who are not in the renounced order of life-transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-gītā.\n\nQuestion 1 : What are some of the transcendental activities of a pure devotee as described in the verse ?\n\nQuestion 2 Who is called a yukta according to Bhagavad-gita ?\n\n[Bhagavad gita 6.18](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/6/18)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'qbvu0l'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qbvu0l/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is618/</li>

When required, he may answer questions on points of righteousness and economy.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.4:1-7\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*336 BC.*\n\nToday was the day.\n\nFor centuries forth, the people of all India would look back upon this iconic day as the day that the wicked Dhanananda was shown the light; as the day that the eleven-year-old boy from Taxila would become the most powerful man in India and use that power to introduce the masses to unprecedented levels of wealth; as the day that Mathura would conquer her conquerors, spreading far and wide the light of the Vedas and of the Arthashastra. \n\nChanakya was sure of it.\n\nIt had been four years since Chanakya had first been admitted to Taxila, and in those four years Chanakya had unified Barhaspatya philosophy with Vedic ethics, discovered and formulated the field of economics, composed the first draft of what would be his magnus opus, the *Arthashastra* (lit. Science of Wealth; Economics), and formulated the master plan for his revolution. \n\nThat was more than most students would achieve in a lifetime or seven. \n\nChanakya thought he ought to be allowed his own gurukula \\[1\\] at this point. The only hindrance against getting one at the age of eleven was that the traditional ceremony to graduate from studenthood was called “marriage”.\n\nAs the first part of his master plan, he had requested an audience with the Magadhan Emperor Dhanananda. Prime Minister Sakadala, apparently intrigued by the young Chanakya, had approved this meeting; his head held high and proud, Chanakya had arrived in Pataliputra, the capital city of Magadha.\n\nHe had to admit that Pataliputra was a beautiful city. Chanakya had stopped at several metropolises on the crumbling Northern Highway on his two-week journey, and every one of them still bore the wounds of war. Kampila had been razed to the ground; over half of Mathura was empty due to massacre and abandonment, and while Chanakya had not stopped at Ayodhya, he expected it to have looked quite similar; Viratanagara, Kosambi, and Varanasi had been brought to ruin by the Nandas’ excessive taxation. \n\nBut the cities of Magadha itself, while impoverished, were still large, well-planned and well-fortified cities that were not too dissimilar from Taxila in order.\n\n“The Emperor and Prime Minister are currently occupied in the audience of a wrestling match in the arena,” said the female attendant. The boy was certainly too young to be offered the traditional pleasures of hospitality, so she just said: “You may rest in the royal courtroom while you await them.”\n\nChanakya strode into the courtroom without stopping by any of the surrounding chairs, headed straight towards the currently unoccupied throne—\n\n—and without so much ceremony, placed himself down on the throne. \n\nNever in her life, nor in any real or fictional story of gossip had Rohini ever observed such a startling display of insolence – had she been of slightly weaker stead, she would have likely fainted in shock. Instead, she composed herself and in a scramble of urgency took another chair from the front row and brought it before Chanakya.\n\nChanakya placed his bag on that chair without another look, then added: “Ask the king to abandon his current shenanigans; this is a matter of far greater importance.”\n\nThis time Rohini did feel a little light-headed. \n\nWhen Chanakya merely placed his water pitcher on the next chair, Rohini pointed weakly at the seat that Chanakya had taken, finding her voice at last: “That’s the Emperor’s throne … most venerable guest.”\n\nChanakya simply *nodded*. It was kind of her, he thought, to be so concerned, but Chanakya knew of the emperor’s low birth already, and did not find that bothersome at all. “I’m not too concerned with rituals of caste and purity,” he said with a smile, “And in any case I’m sure your emperor is also venerable in his own right.”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“ … ”\n\n“Maidservant,” said a most well-mannered voice, “*What* is happening?”\n\nIt was a young boy to whom the voice belonged, at most a year older than Chanakya. Flanked by his two minions and dressed in colourful royal robes, the kid was most obviously a prince. His face seemed more *bemused* than *offended*.\n\nRohini, on the other hand, had turned completely pale in horror.\n\n“Forgive me, prince Pabbata!” she cried, willing herself not to stutter. “I tried to ask him, he doesn’t seem to understand—”\n\nPabbata silenced her with a curt gesture, then walked up to Chanakya. “If you sit on his throne, Father will consider that a declaration of war against him and have you beheaded—” \n\nChanakya promptly raised himself off the throne and walked down the steps of the elevated platform that held it. \n\n“—that is why this kind young lady was asking you to vacate it; she did not wish for you to be misunderstood so.”\n\nSuppressing his shock and terror, Chanakya asked: “If I wished to declare war against your father, why wouldn’t I just *say* that? Why would I come to Pataliputra and sit on his *chair*?” For that matter, why couldn’t the servant just express her wish in *words*? He had heard that many Magadhas were illiterate, but apparently they were also unfamiliar with *language*, preferring to express themselves using some rituals with chairs.\n\n“I see that you have not been trained in court manners,” Pabbata commented, “Or perhaps such manners are different in … where are you from?”\n\n“Taxila,” Chanakya said. “And yes, I would not expect the King of Gandhara to be so offended if I were to sit on his throne. Indeed he would feel quite honored to have his seat graced by a man of such brilliant knowledge and scholarship as myself.”\n\nPabbata and Chanakya introduced themselves to each other, and Chanakya told the prince what he intended to speak with the emperor about – at which Pabbata announced that he wished to speak privately with his guest; once Pabbata’s minions and Rohini had left the courtroom, Pabbata started to look very serious.\n\n“In this case, Chanakya,” he said, “I must advise you against dealing with father at all.” \n\nChanakya raised an eyebrow, and Pabbata turned slowly, looking over each shoulder carefully to ensure that no one was listening. “What I say to you is in confidence, and you may not repeat them to anyone. Do I have your word?” And then without really waiting for Chanakya’s response, he continued: \n\n“My father is hardly like his own father. My grandfather Mahapadma enacted various changes in the administration of Magadha, changes that I believe would have been to your liking, seeing that you are a Brahmin of Gandhara. When Mahapadma seized the throne, it was he who appointed Sakadala as his Prime Minister, who made efforts to assimilate the conquered territories into Magadha, and who ceased the previous dynasties’ practice of burning down cities for sport. My father has only tolerated Sakadala so far because he is too used to his presence and is too lazy to remove him; he does not care the least about such changes as what you might propose.”\n\nChanakya took half a minute to absorb this. \n\nAt last he asked: “What does your father care about, then?” \n\nPabbata merely shrugged. “Wine? Women? Truly, I do not think my father cares about very much at all, and he certainly lacks the will to implement any changes you may suggest – once again, quite unlike his own father who had made such an elaborate effort to capture the throne for himself and then continued to dedicate himself to the administration of Pataliputra.”\n\nChanakya found it laughable that Pabbata thought of Mahapadma’s administration as some sort of bygone golden age. It was under Mahapadma that Mathura and Ujjain had been razed, and under him that many ancient noble lines of Aryavarta had been exterminated. His conquest of Pataliputra had hardly ushered in an era of peace and stability, but was merely one in a long sequence of assassinations and coups. Chanakya himself could already imagine fourteen different methods by which he could assassinate Dhanananda that very day, as Dhanananda had assassinated Mahapadma before him, but it would be pointless to do so without training a suitable replacement: Dhanananda would merely be replaced by another ruinous king, and in at least nine of those fourteen methods, Chanakya would be caught.\n\nSo instead of saying *Your father’s father was also an idiot, your entire family and all the other clans of Magadha are idiots*, Chanakya chose to say: \n\n“This is not to deny the significance of Emperor Mahapadma’s many achievements, but the reforms that I propose are of a far more radical nature than simply *not burning down cities for sport*.”\n\n“And that is precisely why you shouldn’t express them to Father,” Pabbata smiled sadly. “I do not know how, precisely, you will extract yourself from this situation, but I will tell you this: you ought to find a more receptive individual for your advice than Father.”\n\nChanakya considered this. \n\nHe did not quite accept what Pabbata had told him – after all, Pabbata apparently considered Mahapadma to have been an ideal ruler, and there was clearly a lot of internal family politics that motivated Pabbata’s words. Pabbata was Dhanananda’s youngest prince and traditional succession in Magadha was one of primogeniture; his last sentence was likely a subtle invitation for future political alliance – which also raised the question of why Pabbata would trust Chanakya so much, or care so much for his future political support, as to speak so freely with him about his father. \n\nNonetheless, Chanakya decided that he would be at his very *politest* in Dhanananda’s presence, at least for today.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Hence by overthrowing the aggregate of the six vices, \\[a saintly king\\] shall restrain the organs of sense; acquire wisdom by keeping company with the aged; see through his spies; establish safety and security by being ever active; maintain his subjects in the observance of their respective duties by exercising authority; keep up his personal discipline by receiving lessons in the sciences; and endear himself to the people by bringing them in contact with wealth and doing good to them.* \n\n*Thus with his organs of sense under his control, he shall keep away from hurting the women and property of others; avoid not only lustfulness, even in dream, but also falsehood, haughtiness, and evil proclivities; and keep away from unrighteous and uneconomical transactions.* \n\n*Not violating righteousness and economy, he shall enjoy his desires. He shall never be devoid of happiness. He may enjoy in an equal degree the three pursuits of life: righteousness, wealth, and desire, which are inter-dependent upon each other. Any one of these three, when enjoyed to an excess, hurts not only the other two, but also itself.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.7:1-5\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen the Emperor did arrive, it was four hours late, intoxicated and only after repeated prompting, first by his Prime Minister, then by Pabbata through his mother (for Pabbata did not wish his own name to be stained in his father’s mind by Chanakya’s invariable impending disappointment or by the blood of his likely subsequent execution), then finally by a brave attendant who he kicked to the ground in rage.\n\nHe walked up to his throne (at which Chanakya became very glad that the Emperor was late, or he may have found his seat unexpectedly warm), collapsed onto it, and said through closed eyes:\n\n“I hope you brought something interesting for me, Brahmin child. I have only just executed a wrestler and two dancers who didn’t sufficiently capture my intrigue, and you would not wish to add your own name to that list.”\n\nThat was hardly a well-boding start, and the sermon that Chanakya had earlier prepared no longer seemed likely to bear fruit. Thus Chanakya quickly improvised.\n\n“Great King,” the boy said, his tone formal, “I do believe I have something to offer you that will intrigue you more than even the most ferocious wrestler or the most skilful acrobat. You may have met many teachers who preach to you ideals like charity and virtuous conduct without justifying what its benefit is to you. Instead, I will only teach you of your *own* goals, of how you may effectively pursue and achieve them, and how I may aid you in the pursuit of these goals.”\n\nAs he spoke these words, Dhanananda’s expression shifted from one of mere disinterest to being positively *offended*.\n\n“Ah!” he cried, smiling exaggeratedly, “I see! So you claim to be a better knower and director of my own wants than I am. How very interesting!”\n\nChanakya had to force himself to *talk sweetly*, to rephrase every thought of his to a form that he could realistically hope would not excessively offend the king. He would pretend to sympathize with the king’s vilest actions for now, and *slowly*, once he secured a position at the royal court use that position to mould the king’s thoughts and behavior until it was sufficiently righteous … \n\n“Great King, many come to your court claiming that they seek to serve you, yet in truth they only seek to serve their own agendas, their own beliefs about what is virtuous and what is not. I swear to you, to drop all such pretenses and to speak to you honestly on the matter of the policies and decisions you make as emperor, and what their true consequences will be. If you would so permit, I would like to engage in a dialogue of questioning with you in order to offer you a taste of what my service would be as your courtier—”\n\nChanakya wasn’t sure which part it was that elicited this response, but by the end of his speaking, Dhanananda’s eyes had turned icy, and even his fake smile was gone. When a voice was finally heard in response, it was not the emperor’s, but Prime Minister Sakadala’s. \n\n“You dare suggest questioning the emperor, child?”\n\nThe Emperor and his Prime Minister continued to stare at the boy, their eyes offended and hateful.\n\nAnd that was when Chanakya realized that his cause was utterly, completely, hopeless. \n\n*That* was when all the idealistic daydreams of bringing about a golden age as Dhanananda’s advisor left him.\n\n*That* was when he realized what sort of a fool he had been.\n\nEven if by some trickery Chanakya managed to secure a position in the Magadhan court – not only would Chanakya be unable to have any influence in Magadhan administration, such a life would be ruinous to Chanakya’s very soul. Life in service of such a ruler would be all but a physical impossibility.\n\nNo, Pabbata had been speaking the truth – the goal was now no longer a position at Dhanananda’s court, but to safely extract himself out of the situation that he had placed himself in. Yet if he was correct in his assessment of the emperor’s character, merely asking for forgiveness and offering to go separate ways would hardly accomplish that goal. Instead, he would need to *continue* playing the role he had assumed until some *opportunity* arose … to flatter the emperor in a way that would cause the emperor to dismiss him in humour, or with some reward, or with only minor punishment.\n\n“I request your forgiveness for the misunderstanding,” Chanakya said quickly. “I did not mean questioning in the sense of interrogation, nor a scholastic examination, I meant merely an intellectual exercise in which I would demonstrate the generality of the methods I propose to whatever goals and desires the emperor may have. The point I would have then demonstrated was that all goals could be achieved through wealth, and I would have described to you policies for the maximal creation of wealth.” \n\n“And are there any kings in history who enacted such policies?” Prime Minister Sakadala asked, “Whose names you would like to quote to the Emperor?”\n\nThere was the opportunity.\n\n“I believe that Emperor Dhanananda has the potential to exceed all such kings of history. With the expansive territory and wealth that you rule over, O Great King, every step you take has far greater an impact on the nations of the world than the entire lifespans of any king of history.”\n\nThe emperor gave him a very pretentious smile.\n\n“And why, again, do you wish to have a role in that impact that I have?” he questioned. “Ah, yes, because you believe your intervention in my governance will benefit *me*.” \n\nDhanananda sat up straighter, suddenly looking as if he had never been drunk. “You know, Minister,” he said with a sneer towards Sakadala, “The arrogance of the Brahmins never ceases to amaze me – is it that you believe that my father, and indeed all the previous ruling houses of Magadha were all so incompetent that we need *your* advice, or do you believe that it is *I* who am so uniquely incompetent that *I* need your advice?” \n\nChanakya was truly at a loss for words.\n\nThe emperor made a clicking sound in his mouth, shaking his head rapidly. “Oh, no, it’s neither, isn’t it, sweet-talking child? You believe that *I have the capacity to exceed all of them*! Why? Am I not my father’s son? Do you also wish to call me a bastard child, boy?” \n\nWith one look towards the muscular guard who stood at his throne’s side, he made the universal gesture of *off-with-his-head*.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Self-protection shall be the first and constant thought of a wise man; for the life of a man under the service of a king is aptly compared to life in fire; whereas fire burns a part or the whole of the body, if at all, the king has the power either to destroy or to advance the whole family, consisting of sons and wives, of his servants.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.4:16-17\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd that was when Chanakya began to *panic*. \n\nThat was when the true gravity of the situation into which he had placed himself began to impress itself in his mind, and he started racing through his mind in search for *some* solution, some method of escape or to otherwise save his life. Instead, his brain continually returned images of Professor Chanaka’s warnings and all that he had read and heard about Magadha’s barbarism, of the repeated *rationalizations* he had made in his wishful thinking. The best his mind could come up with was to *run with his legs as fast as he could*, a solution which was overridden by the rational part of his mind that reminded him that he could not outrun horses, nor arrows, nor the sound of a conch shell.\n\nIt was Pabbata who came to his rescue.\n\n“Father,” he said with utmost politeness, “While I applaud your decisiveness in awarding an on-the-spot execution, I believe that there may be cause for further deliberation with respect to the precise punishment awarded to this particular offender, and thus a more standard scheduled execution may be more suitable. Consider it a request from your loyal son.”\n\nDhanananda looked surprised, but made a conciliatory gesture.\n\n“Two days,” he said, then stood up. “I give you two days for your *deliberations*, son. After that, I will no longer entertain your offensive client.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *gurukula* – school, analogous to a research group in modern academia; universities were comprised of multiple gurukulas.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire.

As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept prasādam, sanctified food. Lord Kṛṣṇa is offered, according to the Bhagavad-gītā (Bg. 9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, who was always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. Ṭhākura Haridāsa would not even accept prasādam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with Kṛṣṇa's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.\n\nQuestion 1 : How a Kṛṣṇa conscious person person controls his sleep ?

For example, In shankar IAS academy, although there are lower castes, almost all of them seems to be from the upper middle class family. government should check their family total asset's value, keep one benchmark (Like owning 600 sqft or rented house) and only those people should avail reservation. By this method, the poorest of poor from their respective quota might come up. Also, this can prevent Benamis, because they might want their son/daughter or themselves to not avail other quota benefits. The Benamis might be unhappy to register land in their family names. If they did, the total family asset value might increase and they will technically come under general quota, where their generations might suffer. We have PAN card and aadhar card now, and for registration we need these. With these technology, the government should find all the people's asset value, make a total net worth slab for unmovable assets and make them the general caste.

It basically is a affiliate marketing platform. The site hosts various courses on e-marketing and sells them, but if you buy one of the course and sell it through your affiliate link, you get a big chunk of the buyer's payment. And this cycle goes on, so basically people buy that course to sell others the same course with their affiliate link and earn a profit i.e no real product being sold, so it looks to me like a MLM scheme. ( I think the course is just a cover to make it legal.). [A vey in-depth review/analysis of Bizgurukul](https://www.moneylife.in/article/is-bizgurukul-another-e-biz-scam-in-the-making/64716.html)\n\nWhy this came to my notice is, before a few months, my cousin who stays in a metropolitan city told me one of his friends is making thousands every week from this affiliate marketing thing, after a glance I thought it was a scam and I told him too, so he kept quiet for a while. But before about a month he told he took a loan from a friend who was already doing the affiliate marketing thing and got himself a course to start affiliate marketing. Again I tried explaining him how things work and even if you make a profit you'll be scamming someone and that's not good and this is not a permanent gig, you need to learn skills and focus on studies rather than doing all this, but again he did not listen.\n\nNow today, before a few hours, he uploaded [this](https://imgur.com/a/nj9H6iw) post on insta, claiming to have earned 84k in past month. It looks fake to me just because of image quality, it looks like it was reuploaded lot of times. He is not only scamming others, but is also fooling himself and wasting his time when he is in 11th-12th stage, which will definitely impact his life. I am trying to confront him, but he just feels like I am trying to stop him from developing himself. Even if he succeeds in pursuing this affiliate marketing thing as a permanent gig, it would still be unethical to scam innocent people. Also even if that earning is true, how is he going to manage that money, or be it a fraction of it. It is very likely he'll fall into something bad as he is naïve and young.

Missions to Mars, Moons, robots landing on Mars so many other scientific , infra and industrial development around us. The lower middle class climbing up the ladder, Indian population's purchasing caps increasing a bit and several things.\n\nBut what hasn't changed is the radical islamization that happened in the 1990s and that happened in the recent weeks. And the shocking attack of Hindus again where there population is already dwindling.\n\nAnd the other difference is also having what people thought was a strong leader with greater support behind him, to do what it takes to remove the hate , protect all religious followers and faith. But we are seeing is just a silent leader who atleast from the appearance and representation doesn't seem to give a fish about what happened.\n\nNothing not even a condemnation or message that people who are behind this won't be spared, what the Indian public is getting is absolute silence.........\n\nJust a lack to the history and remember what happened in the 1990s\n\n# June 23, 1989\nOn June 23, 1989, pamphlets were  distributed in Srinagar. It was an  ultimatum to Muslim women, by an  organization that called itself  Hazb-i-Islami, to comply with ‘Islamic’ standards within two days or  face ‘action’. Pandit women were asked to put a tilak on their foreheads  for identification.\n\n---\n\nSeptember 2, 1989\nOn  September 2, the 300-year-old Baba Reshi shrine was gutted in a  fire  under mysterious circumstances. On the same morning, a wireless   operator of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), was shot in our   neighbourhood.\n\n---\n\n# October 14 1989\n\nOn Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, on October 14 1989, a massive crowd gathered near the Budshah chowk in the heart of Srinagar, and from there, it marched towards Eidgah to the graveyard that had been renamed the ‘martyr’s graveyard’. The onlookers cheered and showered shireen on the marchers as if to welcome a marriage procession. The crowd was shouting slogans that had shocked most of the Kashmiri Hindus and a few Muslim Nationalists,\n\n    Yahan kya chalega, Nizam-e-Mustafa\n    La sharqiya la garbiya, Islamia Islamia\n    Zalzala aaya hai kufr ke maidaan mein,\n    Lo mujahid aa gaye maidaan mein\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\n    What will work here?

Ganjoo had passed the order of a death sentence on   the JKLF founder, Maqbool Butt in 1968.

He had translated the Bhagwad Gita and Tagore’s Gitanjali into   Kashmiri language. Kashmiriyat died with his killing by Islamists.\n\n---\n\n# 12 days after Taploo's death  Farooq  Abdullah performed a classical dance at Martand\n\nTwelve days after Taploo’s death, the  then chief minister, Farooq  Abdullah, performed a small piece of  classical dance along with dancer  Yamini Krishnamurthy during a  cultural function at the Martand temple. A  few days later, he assured people that militancy would end soon.\n\n---\n\n# Islamization of Kashmir - Mohammed Abdullah Sheikh's Role\n\nThe atrocities done in the past without any fear of punishment still might give enough power to the radical jihads the hope to succeed.\n\nRemember Mohammed Abdullah Sheikh's Role, read on\n\nIslamization  of Kashmir began during 1980's when Abdullah Government changed the  names of about 2500 villages from their native names to new Islamic  names. \n\nThe Sheikh also started delivering communal speeches in mosques  similar to his speeches in 1930's. Additionally, he referred to the  Kashmiri Pandits as “mukhbir” or informers of the Indian government.\n\nISI's  initial attempts to create unrest in Kashmir against the Indian  government were unsuccessful until it started growing in late-1980s. The  Afghan jihad against the Soviets, the Islamic Revolution in Iran and  the armed struggle of the Sikhs in Punjab against the Indian state  became sources of inspiration for large numbers of Kashmiri Muslim  youth.\n\nIn 1986, Shah decided to  construct a mosque within the premises of an ancient Hindu temple inside  the New Civil Secretariat area in Jammu to be made available to the  Muslim employees for 'Namaz'. \n\nPeople of Jammu took to streets to protest  against this decision, which led to a Hindu-Muslim clash. \n\nIn February  1986, Gul Shah on his return to Kashmir valley retaliated and incited  the Kashmiri Muslims by saying Islam khatrey mein hey (trans. Islam is  in danger). \n\nAs a result, Kashmiri Pandits were targeted by the Kashmiri  Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri  Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or  destroyed. \n\nThe worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore.  In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs  plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus.\n\n# During  the middle of the night of 18 and 19 January, a blackout took place in  the Kashmir Valley where electricity was cut except in mosques which  broadcast divisive and inflammatory messages, asking for a purge of  Kashmiri pundits.\n\nThe Hindus were forced to flee Kashmir valley as a result of being targeted by  JKLF and Islamist insurgents during late 1989 and early 1990 Of the  approximately 300,000 to 600,000 Hindus living in the Kashmir Valley in  1990 only 2,000–3,000 remain there in 2016.\n\nThe  Kashmiri Pandits had been a favoured section of the population of the  valley during Dogra rule (1846–1947). 20 per cent of them left the  valley as a consequence of the 1950 land reforms, and by 1981 the Pandit  population amounted to 5 per cent of the total.\n\n# 1950 land reforms - LAND TO TILLER\n\nWhen the land to tiller law of 1950 came into force, even the daughters of poor peasants were treated as part of the estate on which the landlords enjoyed absolute rights. The sweeping land reforms under the Big Landed Estates Abolition Act passed on July 13, 1950, changed the complexion of Kashmiri society.\n\nThe Kashmiri Pandits who were close to tyrannical regime had not got any land outside the Kashmir valley.\n\nIn 1950 when the constituent assembly of the Jammu Kashmir was constituted, it had to decide four points including whether compensation should be given to those landlords who have lost their land through the land abolition act.\n\nOn November 5, 1951 the then Revenue Minister Mirza Muhammad Afzal Beg refused to give compensation to landlords.\n\n---\n\nWhat has changed today, with sadness I would say nothing! Look at the poor laborers who had gone there with the hope of making a future.\n\nShot from the back when returning home with their carts. How coward must one be .\n\nHow coward one must be to kill such an harmless man, which god or book teaches you to do this. Radical Islam and Jihad has never succeeded anywhere and will never succeed.\n\nWhile there were attacks in Bangladesh , there were also people who came out in support of the Hindu minority and called out the islamic radical idiots ! I feel sorry inspite of so much support and security , the local Kashmiris aren't coming out , what are they fearing, why are they being a mute spectator ? This land is as much as theirs as it is ours, does anyone shot them in the back when they open a Kashmiri handloom in part of India or have hatred towards them and not shop at their place. No not at all, then what else are they waiting for or fear about.\n\nI hope the Indian govt inspite of all what is happening will go after all the radical elements who are there to cause bad environment and will resettle the people back with assurance\n\nThis is not the Kashmir we want,\n\n- Virender Paswan came to Kashmir all the way from Bhagalpur, Bihar, to eke out an honest livelihood as golgappa seller.

Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together. There is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gītā. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to Kṛṣṇa will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ papa ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to Kṛṣṇa, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, only the Kṛṣṇa conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.\n.\nQuestion 1 : What are the regulations that a yogi must follow in his diet ?\n.\n[Bhagavad Guta 6.16](http://gloriousgita.com/verse/en/6/16)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'qaoapg'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qaoapg/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is616/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How I understood every idea and philosophy around me is a lie and propaganda'<br />Body: 'I was born in West Bengal to a liberal Hindu family. Went to a Christian school where we prayed everyday. Was taught  about human rights and became a humanist and a communist at an early  age. But, I eventually understood the lies. Below are some of the propaganda:\n\n1. Human Rights - This \'Human Rights\' system is utter garbage propaganda propounded by a useless organization called UN. They declared \'Rights\' for appeasement politics. There are no Rights in this Universe, we get justice according to our karma. They have made very harmful \'Human Rights\' like right to asylum, which does nothing except creating Islamic States. They teach that every human has a \'Right\' to food, shelter, etc. BS. These things are earned, not given as freebies - it only creates lazy socialist countries.\n\n2. Psychology - Complete western propaganda. All of psychology is just western models made by western psychologists, depending upon western samples. They don\'t understand any culture beyond western culture. The DSM is a socio-political tool, which serves each current government. Today the 100+ genders are called \'normal\' by DSM. Tomorrow these same people will say pedophilia is normal. To give an example, Psychology says spanking children is \'child abuse\' (but children watching porn isn\'t), even though our country has beaten up children since dawn of humanity, and nothing bad has ever come out  of it. Beating children for wrongdoing is actually a good thing, something western Psychology will never understand.\n\n3. Economics - Similar to psychology, everything is western and based on selfish western people\'s behaviour.\n\n4. Democracy - debunked by a Greek guy like Plato. Probably also debunked by Indian philosophers. It is a crappy system in which illiterate people rule. What the world needs is a dharmic ruler, not some crappy \'secular\' democracy which focuses on welfare for adharmic people.\n\n5. Equality - biggest myth of all time, something that even western people don\'t believe (why does UN have \'veto\' system? Why does western countries assume India to be inferior and Indians to be stupid \'curry-n!ggas\' who can\'t handle nukes?). Who is equal to whom? Nobody is equal to anyone, everyone is unique and have different talents and morals. Why should we adopt western concepts of equality and its perverted form \'equity\'? Why should everyone be treated equally in front of the Law? Why should [true] Brahmins, who have the highest knowledge of self, get equal punishment to a [true] Shudra who is materialistic and bad for the society?\n\n6. Secularism - it means separating Church and State because often there are corrupt clergies and Laws that can be exploited. But why should we Indians care? In our country, kings were righteous and great because they read Vedas. Why should we separate dharma and State? Its Christianity\'s problem that it gives rise to corrupt people, why should we care?\n\n7. Science - western, ambiguous, extremely reductionist, naturalist and totally statistical in nature. Anomalies in Science aren\'t even explained. If a medicine works for 60% of the people, scientists declare it \'works\' and the rest of the 40% of cases aren\'t even studied or attempted to explain. Politics is rife in modern Science. There is almost nothing positive that Science has given us. The technologies have made us slaves (which we can consciously escape from due to dharma), addictive and non-spiritual. Have you ever seen a yogi who is addicted to social media and uses a lot of technologies? No, because reality does not require these.\n\n8. Rationality and Empiricism - close-minded, period. By this philosophy, we can\'t even prove the existence of our own consciousness and memories. Empiricism rejects personal experiences, anecdotes and spiritual experiences, that\'s why western scientists reject Hinduism. Rationalists can only say "Bring evidence" like a bot. They don\'t understand dharma or Vedas or Puranas or Samadhi or Nirvana.\n\n9. Religions and superstitions - How many religions do these \'skeptics\' know about? These people read a few pages from the Bible and after debunking them thinks, huh, I am now intelligent and all religions are false. How many scientists have done research on the effects of mantras in Vedas? Or the so-called \'superstitions\'? Who says  black magic, mantras, evil eyes, astrology etc. aren\'t real? Western people and Indians influenced by the West just assume them to be \'false\' and \'superstition\' because these knowledge comes from India. Remember, \'rationalist\' Hindus like Ram Mohan Roy were stooges of the British and Mughals.\n\n10. Pacifism - Another hippie BS. While naive morons advocate for pacifism in their country, others build nukes and prepare themselves to attack the country. Thanks to evil people like Churchill and Truman, US and UK are where they are, if those countries were in hands of the \'pacifists\', they would have never been superpowers. Strengthening the country should be the highest priority, not some \'welfare schemes\' for votebank politics.\n\n11. Medicine - When Indian people in ancient times used  to get sick, they didn\'t use harmful chemicals made by Big Pharma with manipulated data and Stats, but herbs and mantras to cure diseases. You must have heard in school the propaganda - before modern medicine, mortality rates around the world was horrifying! People used to die just because of a cut! Thanks to modern medicine, it doesn\'t happen anymore. Bullsh!t. Ask them where they get the data for mortality of ancient times and their agenda becomes clear. They take the data (even that was incomplete) from Athens, Greece and then extrapolated to the world! That\'s their \'data\'. In reality, you will find evidence of better health during ancient times - people didn\'t die from obesity or depression like people of today, they were valorant, courageous and honorable and usually used to die in battles. I have come to realize that modern medicine is crap, Ayurveda and mantras from Upanishads and Vedas should be used to treat diseases. We should stop this western propaganda by evil for-profit organizations who create harmful medicines and has made this entire body of hoaxes called \'modern medicine\'.\n\n12. Conspiracies - there is a trend among \'skeptics\' and \'rationalists\' to dismiss conspiracy theories (only right wing ones though. Left wing ones are considered very rational). We all know the  numerous coups organized by US in other parts of the world and the conspiracies by Pakistan in Kashmir...yet these naive 13 year old skeptics who have no understanding of politics and world affairs, who are probably the same guys who think \'which of the 100 genders am I\', are the ones who lecture us about how conspiracies of LGBT agenda, taqqiya, etc. are ridiculous. Those kids should remember, our conspiracy theories come from age old wisdom of great men, accumulated throughout history, not some guys who change their theories every now and then.'<br />Author: 'N0nPolitical'  id: 'qajkwy'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qajkwy/how_i_understood_every_idea_and_philosophy_around/</li>

Any psychiatrist in this sub are most welcome to throw some light on the topic.'<br />Body: "I have been doing Internet research a lot and I check out a lot of symptoms of the list of ADHD diagnosis. It's all starting to make sense as to why my life is such a mess even at the age of 29, a time when most  of my friends are crorepatis, have successful lives and families, I am still asking my dad for cash.\n\nhere is somewhat of self evalution i did watching youtube videos:\n- I forget to take back the change for store cashier if I bought something, sometimes even forget to take the stuff I bought from the store. sign of forgetfulness\n- another sign of my forgetfulness is that, I lose my motorcycle keys more often than my friends as they own motorcycles too. sometimes I even left my keys in the motorcycle handle lock, thank god it didn't get stolen\n- i sometimes also forget where i parked my vehicle. for example if i got to mall with my friends and spend like 4 hours there, then come back to have myself searching for where i parked my bike.\n- during my master's degree, i had lot of lab work to do to get my results of experiments and compile them. left to my own faculties, that wouldn't have completed even in a time period of a year. but there was my senior, who helped me a lot, i mean l lot, she used to sit hours on end with me doing experiments with me. thanks to her all of that got completed. then it came to writing thesis and research paper. thesis i managed to write just before deadline, but research paper never came, I began writing it but never saw it to completion. its been two years now since my master's now and currently i am pursuing PhD with buttload of mental problems. huge sign of procrastination\n-  another mundane signs are, just like dishes in the sink, letting laundry pile up even when i know the fact that i need clean clothes the next day, I never to wash them. procrastination here too\n- if i have to go visit another place, i need to start packing my luggage, which i do at the 11th hour, and packing is obviously messy\n-  as the person on video said, he sucked at money and time management, so do i. i know i have very little money left in my bank account but i'll be damned if I don't buy the limited time combo deal at Burger King. next thing i know i have money that's not even enough to buy a pen. example of impulse buying and spending \n- i run from routines and schedules. like my lab where i work, its open 24 x 7 for students. but i prefer to work at night instead of daytime because of the fact that i will have to face my supervisor who will then scold me for my delay in providing results. this is a lot more damaging as one psychiatrist pointed out that people with ADHD need structure and organisation in their lives\n- physically, my body is a mess. my blood sugar level keeps fluctuating, my liver is a little fatty even when my alcohol consumption is rare, i am very overweight. so if i decide to got to gym after mustering enough motivation, in a period of 30 days, i will go to the gym for only 4 days. why? because motivation is not there. \n- to get myself into a more organised environment, i decided that i will leave my country and go to japan for few years after PhD, a highly organised, rule-oriented, disciplined country. so i decided to learn japanese language last year. but till now I have made absolute shit progress in doing so. one full year and all i managed was to learn only 25 kanji characters. i am also really slow in reading hiragana and katakana and also keep forgetting katakana. so that sucks"<br />Author: 'yama_no_Ou'  id: 'qagtik'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qagtik/has_anyone_of_you_been_diagnosed_with_adhd_if_yes/</li>

Like seriously, where is dharma and dharmic people? All Hindu festivals have become perverted - in Bengal, Durga Puja isn't a time for devotion to Maa Durga, but an excuse to eat biryani, coke, do gossip, wear expensive clothes, or just get drunk in a bar and have night stands. There is no devotion in anyone anymore.\n\nMy dad, who was a Congressi, literally changed my birthdate to  get me into a Christian missionary school where I had to pray to Jesus everyday. Even now, when I feel guilty, I subconsciously do a cross sign due to childhood indoctrination. Christian missionaries are almost everywhere in Bengal - trying to convert as many people as possible.\n\nOur constitution isn't modeled on dharma or anything - nope, its modeled on some western concept called 'democracy' and 'human rights'. Huh, 74 years into this western 'democracy' and all  we have is appeasement and anti-Hindu hate. People think wearing dhoti is 'ew' but wearing pants is amazing. People think eating muri is bad, but pizza is 'cool'. People think speaking Hindi is substandard but English is amazing. People think Islam is a religion of peace while Hinduism is a ridiculous and dangerous religion based on superstitions. People think separating State and a philosophy like dharma is bad just because western people thought mixing State and Church was bad. Women think that being a housewife and doing household works is bad but having alcohol and orgies is great. People think listening to Lata Mungeskar is 'uncool' but listening to wh*res like Nicki Minaj is cool.\n\nOur books are filled with bashing Hinduism and its culture, frequently bringing sati, caste system as they like to call it, superstitions, etc. We all know how people like Thapar, Habib, etc. have created the Pakistani narrative that Hinduism was a savage religion and thanks to Islam we are now  civilized (you can ask any Pakistani whether they believe in this narrative and their answer will always be yes). Yet the government hasn't been able to punish any of these vile creatures called 'Marxist historians'. Rather than following the guru-shisya disciplined education system, we have corrupt commercial education practices and indisciplined teenagers who fall into vices at a young age due to lack of emphasis on brahmacharya. Our books idolize the 'Human Rights' system, an utterly garbage system that was formed after seeing Nazi Germany's atrocities. Ya, the intention is good, but its such a trash and illogical system though. In it, forcing your child to chant mantras is 'violation of Child Rights' while children watching porn and sharing it isn't even a concern...rather western people encourage it saying that its only 'natural' for teenagers to be horny...what pedophiles made this system of Rights? \n\nYoga - the path to realizing brahman is now just a mere exercise that bollywood druggy people like Shilpa Shetty do in yoga pants and sports bra in sexual ways in order to get fake 'spirituality'. India is now associated with Kamasutra thanks to western immoral hippies who took Hinduism and distorted it in the worst ways  possible. The entire mission of Swami Vivekananda has gone into trash  thanks to  these mofo hippies. Western people can never understand our culture, they only take our Hindu culture and distort it with their pea-sized brain.  \n\nWe have sold ourselves to the West and Islamic countries. People want to go to foreign countries like US, UAE, etc. to get sweet sweet money rather than catering to our country. I have seen Indian Americans praising Modiji. All of them are traitors - they left our country for greed of money and marry foreign women. In greed of money, we have to comply with WTO, IMF and UN instructions, for those sweet 'foreign direct investment' and 'oil/gas'. We have less nuclear weapons (we actually wouldn't even have nukes if it weren't for Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee ji) than Pakistan thanks to the egoist superpowers like Murica and Russia who hoards thousands of nukes not letting us to create nukes.\n\nI have recently been following String, a Hindu YouTube channel exposing Islam and Christian missionaries in India. Man, I have been living under a rock...there's just so much conspiracies! We are surrounded by Islamic and western conspiracies. How do you stay sane? I am completely overwhelmed by the conspiracies.

Two non-local labourers in Srinagar and Pulwama were on Saturday shot dead by terrorists in two separate attacks in Srinagar and Pulwama. This is the latest in a spate of terror-related attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in recent weeks. Arvind Kumar Sah of Banka, Bihar succumbed to injuries in Srinagar while Sagir Ahmad of UP critically injured in Pulwama. Areas have been cordoned and searches started.\n\n* Last night: Based on intelligence input regarding likely presence of some terrorists in Drangbal, Pampore, a joint operation was launched by Indian Army, J&amp;K Police and CRPF on the night of 15 Oct 2021.  While laying of cordon around suspected area, terrorists opened fire on troops from a house. Call for surrender went unheeded. They opened indiscriminate fire on security forces, which was retaliated to, resulting in neutralization of 2 hardcore terrorists. Terrorists neutralised have been identified by J&amp;K Police as Umar Mustaq Khandey, a resident of Tulbagh, Pampore, active since Oct 2020 &amp; Shahid Khursheed Dar of Methan Champora, Srinagar. One AK-47 &amp; other warlike stores recovered from the encounter site: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1449399316682928134)\n\n* A day ago, there was news that [Pakistan\'s ISI held confidential meeting with terror outfits to plan attacks in J&amp;K, target](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-isi-confidential-meeting-terror-outfits-plan-attacks-in-jk-target-kashmiri-pandits-exclusive-1865022-2021-10-15)\n\n* Citing Pakistan\'s frustration as the cause of such incidents, Major General Sudhakar Jee (Retd) told Asianet Newsable, "The progressive return of 3800 Kashmir Pandits, a gradual, albeit small, increase in  tourist footfalls, resuming of economic and commercial activities besides steady corporate investment -- despite all-out efforts by Pakistan to counter the same is something that stares mockingly at its successive failures and attempts to deny normalcy to the Union Territory."\n\n* Prime Minister Narendra Modi set out his Taliban worries to world leaders this week, Indian forces staged raids and battled Kashmir militants who he fears could be emboldened by the Islamists\' victory in Afghanistan. Shootings of civilians and police, raids by the security forces on militant hideouts, and insurgent infiltrations across the India-Pakistan ceasefire line have all increased in the Muslim-majority region since the Taliban overran Kabul on August 15.  [France24](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211016-india-fears-taliban-fallout-in-kashmir)\n\n* Even the [Washington Post](https://archive.is/qWD7B) reported that: This moment marks a “turning back in time” for Kashmir, said Avinash Paliwal, a foreign policy expert on South Asia at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies.\n“These targeted killings of minorities are meant to create a political effect and further polarize an already polarized situation,” he said. This was likely to invite a forceful response from New Delhi, Paliwal said.\n\n* Then there are politicians in the Valley who are trying to give a political angle to the spurt in terror attacks. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti has tweeted, “Disturbing to see the deteriorating situation in Kashmir where a minuscule minority is the latest target. GOI’s claims of building a Naya Kashmir has actually turned it into a hellhole. Its sole interest is to use Kashmir as a milch cow for its electoral interests.” Mehbooba is harping on her old tune for starting negotiations with Pakistan and separatists on resolving the Kashmir issue.  This is nothing new. Whenever there will be a spurt in terror activity, Mehbooba Mufti will say that she had forewarned about the abrogation of Article 370. To put it on record, Mehbooba had said two years ago that if Article 370 was removed, there will not be a single Indian to raise the tricolour in the Valley. \n\n* Pakistan press refers to killed terrorists as martyrs or "[innocent people](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2021/10/16/india-killed-10-innocent-people-in-kashmir-last-week-foreign-office/)."

Dark Ages: Reconquest period (1670 – 1756)\n\n**Prologue: the thousand-year recession**\n\nThe political system of Bronze Age India was probably a plutocracy.\n\nIn its peak, the Indus Valley civilization was the source of various technological innovations particularly in the fields of agriculture, water management, infrastructure and measurement. As the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered and very little of its writing remains, it is harder to comment on its academic achievements, most of these are first known from Mesopotamia (Egypt is a somewhat overrated Bronze Age civilization – it showed very little urbanization and was also a late adopter of the wheel; it just has an impressive archaeological record because of its palace economy).\n\nIn 1900 BC, a global depression struck. Indian cities crumbled; Near Eastern cities turned into stagnant palace economies; almost no inventions date to this period.\n\nAnd then in 1200 BC, civilization collapsed. \n\nIt was the most mysterious event: Cities throughout the world burned and perished, literacy vanished, disease and local violence became widespread – civilization, from Greece to Gujarat, just *collapsed*.\n\nMany historians posit pseudo-explanations for the Late Bronze Age collapse, like climate change, or “General Systems Collapse”, but none of these “explanations” are really good as scientific theories. Folks of the time were as confused by the event as we are – a letter from the Syrian king Ammurapi to the king of Cyprus reads:\n\n&gt;My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka?... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.\n\nTo which the governor of Cyprus responded:\n\n&gt;Concerning those enemies: (it was) the people from your country (and) your own ships (who) did this! And (it was) the people from your country (who) committed these transgression(s)...I am writing to inform you and protect you. Be aware!\n\nFollowing the collapse, the various peoples of the old Bronze Age world constructed several theories to explain the events of the decades prior. The Greeks blamed themselves for it and created the fabulous story of the Trojan war; well, stories of wars being fought over women are like photographs of the Big Foot, but the destruction of Troy was a historical event and seemed to have made a particular impression on the Greeks. \n\nIn India, while Vedic literature only mentions the drying of the Sarasvati river, bardic legend postulated a conspiracy that eventually formed the basis of the *Mahabharata*: briefly, Krishna, the ruler of Dwaraka, creates an elaborate plot to manipulate the states of the world into a costly war to wipe out the prevailing political establishment and rid the world of the cultural degradation of the Late Bronze Age so that civilization can start anew. \n\nThe Mahabharata is a brilliant piece of literature: it has intelligent and ambitious characters (Krishna, Shakuni), passionate characters (Arjuna, Draupadi, Abhimanyu, Drupada, Shikhandi), and NPCs (Yudhishtira, the entire Kuru state), each with their own goals and schemes, only to ultimately find these schemes as tools for Krishna’s grand agenda; its characters plot and strategize, rather than just find their luck at the mercy of the plot; and the text was eventually expanded to cover various philosophical themes (most famously the Bhagavad Gita) as well as various regional tales of India. The postulation of a conspiracy, however, is likely to be a simplification of emergent social phenomena, and specific characters are likely to be personifications of such phenomena, an example of the Great Man Theory.\n\nFor years to come, the Late Bronze Age collapse inspired the pessimistic myth of the Four Ages in both India and Greece, as people extrapolated the decline in prosperity and order to a continuous decline in human morality from the beginning of time. \n\nAnd then around 1200 BC, man struck iron.\n\n**Early Iron Age (1200 BC – 750 BC)**\n\nIron smelting was simultaneously invented in India and by the Hittites, and spread so rapidly across the world that the precise location of its invention cannot be pinned down, and by 800 BC it had spread across almost the entirety of the old world. While iron, mainly meteoritic iron had been used in small quantities in some sites in India and Egypt for millennia, the large scale production of iron for tools and weapons brought vast social and economic changes throughout the world. Bellary (let’s call it Kishkinda), an early site in the Deccan, was one of the earliest centers of iron mining, and Southern India remained the world’s premier metallurgical center for millennia to come.\n\nIron was cheaper and far more abundant than bronze, making it accessible to the folk outside the nobility. Large quantities of forest could be cleared for the first time, allowing for large-scale settlement and urbanization of regions outside of the “Desert Stretch”. As metal was no longer monopolized by the state, the importance of private guilds and merchants increased relative to governments and nobility, leading to the development of cities far larger than ever seen before.\n\nThis radical change in the way of thought about social organization occurred in the Kuru kingdom (around modern-day Delhi) c. 1000 BC. While the traditional Aryan political system had revolved around the nobility, at some point some people in the Kuru kingdom decided that they in fact valued knowledge and learning more than nobility and government, and they began ambitious project to compile all the known knowledge of the time into a corpus of literature known as the *Vedas* (lit. knowledge).\n\nThis culture, the Vedic culture, which came to expand Eastward, to *win* and to dominate Indian politics and thought for centuries forth, was the ideological manifestation of the brave new world that was the iron age. \n\n**Middle Iron Age (750 BC – 493 BC)**\n\nA host of advancements, known as the *Second Urbanization*, began around the 8th century BC, centered around the kingdom of Ayodhya. Large walled cities appeared across the Gangetic plain, facilitating an expansion of the Indian economy. Various financial innovations came into existence, e.g. loan deeds, and the world’s earliest coins probably having been minted in Ayodhya. The sciences came into existence: mathematics, medicine, economics, linguistics; supported by universities such as Taxila. The Great Highways – the Uttarapatha (Northern Road) and Dakshinapatha (Southern Road) – were built, expanding trade and commerce. Civilization reached the Tamil country, and the tribes of the Dandaka forest were subdued, making it accessible for medicine, hunting and timberland. Yajnavalkya, the father of philosophy, wrote the two oldest known philosophical texts: the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and the Shatapatha Brahmana, the latter of which is also one of the earliest texts (alongside the Apastambha and Baudhayana sutras) to mention the Pythagoras theorem, thus starting mathematics as we know it. The Upanishads suggest a culture of free debate and skeptical inquiry, and spawned the various Indian philosophical schools. \n\nAncient India as we know it was born.\n\nThe epic narrative *Ramayana* attributes the advancements of this period to the Ayodhyan prince Rama – e.g. the university of Taxila is described as having been established under Rama’s rule and administered by his brother and provincial governor of Gandhara, Bharata. Vedic literature, on the other hand, attributes each of these achievements to different men:\n\n* The enlightenment and philosophical ideas that built this glorious civilization is attributed to philosophers like Yajnavalkya, a native of Ayodhya who flourished in the court of King Janaka of Mithila.\n* The Kingdom of Ayodhya (Kosala) became particularly prosperous and influential, creating the culture known today to historians as “Greater Kosala”.\n* The taming of the Dandaka forest is attributed to a state known as Dakshina Kosala (South Kosala).\n* The transmission of ideas to the South is attributed to Sage Agastya; this is also corroborated by Tamil texts. While Northern texts discuss Agastya’s introduction of Sanskrit and the Vedas to the South, Tamil texts describe his introduction various agricultural advancements and urbanization. \n* The University of Taxila is attributed to the sage Uddhalaka Aruni, who migrated Westward from Ayodhya. \n\nRepublics also became commonplace, alongside monarchies, during the Middle Iron Age – apart from some sparse and mountainous states (e.g. Buddha’s Shakya kingdom), the states of Kuru, Panchala, Mathura, Kushinagara, Vaishali and Kamboja followed republic or king consul constitutions at various points, with Vaishali probably a direct democracy. Some people also like pointing out that among the scholars who challenged Yajnavalkya in debate were two women, Gargi Vachaknavi and Maitreyi, the latter of whom would later become his wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Large cities of Iron Age India, per archaeological excavations. The Mahajanapada kingdoms, that are of central focus in Buddhist texts, are a bit biased towards the cities of the region east of Varanasi. ](https://preview.redd.it/ri4aptno1qt71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37f4be343321e7d14554c6093e8b75badcdc915)\n\n**Late Iron Age (492 BC – 323 BC)**\n\nThe Late Iron Age begins with the coronation of Ajatashatru of Magadha. In the 5th century BC, all the states of Northern India bar Magadha were dominated by the prosperous and urban Vedic culture, that among other features placed Brahmins at the top of the caste system. The relative backwater of Magadha, which retained the more traditional kshatriya-centric pre-Vedic system, was the arch-enemy of Vedic civilization in the latter’s literature, and its expansion tilted the political balance between the three castes.\n\nAjatashatru was a brilliant inventor, who created several military contraptions including the catapult and the famous scythed chariot. He then used these devices to go on a murderous rampage, conquering the states of Champa, Vaishali, Varanasi, Malla and even Ayodhya. The city of Mathura resisted Magadhan conquest for 150 years, a feat that is attributed to the celebrated Vrishni heroes – Samkarshana, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The cult of Vāsudeva became particularly influential, and would eventually form the basis of the legend of Krishna-worship. \n\nAjatashatru’s expansion brought him into tussle with another rival empire-builder, Pradyota of Ujjain, leading to the Avanti-Magadhan wars. The Magadhan (Pataliputra) Empire and the Ujjain Empire would form two of India’s three longest-lasting empires alongside the later Deccan Empire, lasting under various dynasties for a period of nearly 2000 years, the Imperial Age of India. \n\nThe Late Iron Age also saw the beginning of West and Central Asian raids in North-Western India (Pakistan), with the Persian invasion of the Indus Valley. Despite the North-Western region (except Gandhara) being a relative backwater in India, these regions formed some of the wealthiest provinces of the Persian empire: Gandhara was the richest of all Persian satrapies, and Sindh contributed a third of the empire’s total tribute revenue. While all other satraps paid their tributes in silver, the Indian states paid theirs in gold. \n\nMeanwhile the kingdom of Anga in modern-day Bengal/eastern Bihar transformed into a powerful thalassocracy whose merchants traded with distant lands in South East Asia, beginning the Indianization process in South-East Asia. The founding legends of many South-East Asian states include an origin at Anga: Funan (Cambodia) was supposedly established by the Brahmin merchant Kaundinya who married the local Naga princess Soma after defeating her pirate army; its capital Champa is named after Anga’s capital of the same name. A similar story comes from Sri Lanka, but with a prince instead of a merchant and a Yakshini instead of a Naga.\n\n**Classical Age: First Golden Age (322 BC – 269 BC)**\n\nThe history of Classical India begins with the polymath Chanakya: father of economics, founder and first Prime Minister of the pan-Indian Maurya Dynasty, father of cryptography, and a brilliant military tactician.\n\nChanakya was probably a Deccanite Brahmin (based on Jain sources and modern analyses of the context of the Arthashastra) – it is generally agreed that he studied in Taxila, and was strongly influenced by both Carvaka and Hindu philosophy. His magnum opus, the *Arthashastra* (“Science of Wealth”), begins with salutations to Brihaspati (the legendary founder of the Carvaka philosophy); it declares economics as the fundamental social science, wealth as an encapsulation of human goals, and its maximization the goal of government policy. However, he mentions his differences with the Carvakas (the “school of Brihaspati”) on areas where he displays a more conservative Hindu outlook, e.g. accepting the fundamental role of the physical sciences (“Anvikshaki”) as well as of morality.\n\nOn economic policy, the Arthashastra prescribes low taxes, market freedom and public-private partnerships for infrastructural developments, as well as state measures to discourage ascetism and increase productivity and industriousness. On statecraft it describes an efficiently organized state, and extensively discusses foreign policy covering areas including espionage, diplomacy, war strategy and logistics, and military technology. The political position of the text is significantly to the right of ancient Western philosophies, e.g. usury is considered an acceptable source of income.\n\nChanakya’s primary contribution to the political landscape was his plot to instate his protege Chandragupta on the throne of Magadha, thus Sanskritizing the Magadhan empire. Under his ministerial leadership, the empire went on to unite the entirety of the Indian sub-continent\\*, covering at its peak a third of the world’s population and half the global economy.\n\nThe precise sequence of events that lead to the establishment of the Maurya Dynasty in Magadha isn’t clear, but the following facts seem likely:\n\n* Chanakya started with very little capital, and grew it rapidly to raise an army. \n* Chandragupta was originally of non-royal birth, and Chanakya declared him as a kshatriya on basis of his merits.\n* The dynasty was associated with the peacock, suggesting that Chandragupta’s base might have been in Mathura.\n* An initial direct military attack on Pataliputra had failed.\n* Much of Chanakya’s success involved complicated manipulations of various governments including Central Asians, Himalayans, Persians, Greeks and Magadha rather than a brute force attack.\n* Chandragupta’s army when invading Magadha included Greek and other mercenaries.\n\nThe early Mauryan period (under the rule of emperors Chandragupta and Bindusara) was a golden age in Indian history, with massive economic and infrastructural expansion and the development of various new financial innovations such as private corporations, cheques and the double-entry bookkeeping system. Panini’s formalization of Classical Sanskrit grammar dates to this period, as does the mathematician Pingala who set the groundwork for later classical Indian mathematical traditions.\n\nThe later popularity of Vaishnavism was partly rooted in the foundation of the Maurya dynasty, as the dynasty was the culmination of Mathura’s resistance against Magadhan rule. The Bhagavad Gita, a synthesis of Upanishadic philosophy, the legend of Vāsudeva, and the earlier Mahabharata legend, was probably written during this period.\n\nThe Maurya-Seleucid treaty facilitated an expansion in trade and migration between India and Greece and allowed for the transmission of ideas and knowledge. For example, Indian merchants, who dominated East-West trade, introduced various financial innovations to the societies they frequented, and Indian tradition credits the Greeks as the source of classical Indian astronomy.\n\n\\* the Tamil country is not usually shown as having been directly under imperial rule, but Tamil Sangam literature shows heavy Mauryan influence in the Pandya government.\n\n**Classical Age: Civil War period (268 BC – 181 BC)**\n\nThe late period of the Mauryan dynasty, starting with the coronation of Ashoka the Great, which is short for “Ashoka the Greatest Argument in Favor of Abortion”, is the only period in pre-medieval India with documented evidence of systematic ideological persecution and political intolerance. Among his many crowning achievements, Ashoka:\n\n* Established a national moral police and a Ministry of Morality\n* Allocated a large fraction of state resources to political propaganda and Buddhist proselytism\n* Criminalized blasphemy and heresy, brutally persecuting rival philosophies\n* Built a torture chamber underneath his palace\n* Punished an uprising in Kalinga by mass-murdering his own civilians\n* Installed an imperial harem of women, then burned them to death when he heard them call him short and ugly\n* Exterminated the Ajivika philosophers in a systematic genocide\n* Another genocide against the Jains which was later called off because too many non-Jains died\n* Another genocide against “fake Buddhists” (people who pretended to be Buddhist to receive government funds)\n* Eventually bankrupted the empire with his fiscally irresponsible programs \n\nThe civil unrest and tensions eventually culminated in the Great Civil War of 230 BC, resulting in a tripartite split of the empire. Although the Brahmins were not themselves persecuted by Ashoka, they pretty much led the revolution against what had become of the Mauryan dynasty. The South seceded, lead by Simuka, who founded the Deccan Empire. Back at Pataliputra, an anti-Buddhist faction formed (supported most famously by Queen Tishyaraksha and her son Dasharatha), and various revolts and uprisings throughout the empire resulted in a split of the remaining Northern empire between Ashoka’s heirs Dasharatha and Samprati, who ruled from Magadha and Ujjain respectively.\n\nA particular consequence of this division – which would be exacerbated in the following centuries due to the Buddhist patronage of Central Asian invaders – was the “Big Switch” in the geography of the Indian ideological divide. Magadha, which had once been the enemy of Vedic civilization, was now a Vedic dominion, while the North-Western cities of Mathura, Ujjain and Taxila came under Buddhist influence. \n\nThe Great Civil War – and the Mauryan dynasty with it – came to a whimpering end in 180 BC with the assassination of the emperor Brihadratha Maurya by his general Pushyamitra Shunga during a military parade.\n\n**Classical Age: Invasions period (180 BC – 249 AD)**\n\nThe end of the Late Maurya dynasty greatly reduced Buddhist and other non-Hindu political power in India: the Shunga dynasty and the Deccan Empire’s Satavahana dynasty were both not only non-Buddhist, but were ruled directly by Brahmin emperors. In an attempt to reclaim political power, the Buddhists supported various central Asian invaders in exchange for political patronage; it is not clear precisely how they did so, perhaps it was the Buddhists who had enjoyed positions of political power in the Magadhan empire from Ashoka’s time on who were in a position to commit treason.\n\nThe first of these invaders were the Greco-Bactrians c. 180 BC, who plundered Mathura, Ayodhya and even Pataliputra before being repelled by the heroic Kalingan commander Kharavela who came to aid the empire that had once massacred his people. They continued to have a presence as far as Mathura for about 20 years where they harassed the local Mitra rulers before eventually being defeated by them.\n\nNext came the Scythians c. 80 BC, who plundered the western country-side and briefly even occupied Mathura c. 60 BC. \n\nThe key political figure from the period is Vikramaditya, who re-established the ancient Ujjain Empire and conquered the Scythian tribes c. 57 BC. Vikramaditya became one of the most celebrated heroes in Indian history – his name became a honorific title throughout India (analogous to Caesar, or Sikandar), and his victory over the Scythians marks the epoch of the Indian calendar. He heavily employed Sanskrit in administration (which had previously only been the language of academia), and the Vishnu cult grew in importance. \n\nThe Ujjain empire dominated North-Western India until the invasion of the Tibetian Kushans c. 78 AD, who sponsored two pre-existing Scythian satraps of the Ujjain Empire: the Kshaharatas (led by Nahapana) and the Kardamakas (led by Rudradaman). Traditional legend holds that the Scythians were backed in their war against Ujjain by Shalivahana (possibly the same as Sivasvati), the emperor of the Deccan who had married Scythian princesses and had formed alliances with them. Following the fall of Ujjain, however, the Deccan Empire itself came into conflict with the Scythians: Gautamiputra Satakarni defeated the Kshaharatas, but his son Vashishtiputra Satakarni lost most of the reconquered territory to the Kardamakas. \n\nThe Kushans were the only pre-Islamic foreign dynasty to hold a lasting presence in inner India (i.e. Mathura and Ujjain), ruling as far as Ayodhya at their peak, before being defeated c. 200 AD by an alliance of Indian states including Ujjain, Mathura ([Nagas of Padmavati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagas_of_Padmavati)), and the [Yaudheyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaudheya) of Punjab. Despite their foreign origin, the Kushans and their Scythian vassals were not necessarily barbarians in the same vein as earlier Scythian invaders. As feudatories of Ujjain, the Scythian tribes in India (as well as earlier Greek migrants) had assimilated into the kshatriya caste, using Sanskrit in their administration, paying homage to Indian philosophies and deities in their inscriptions and adopting the technologies of civilized people. \n\nThey were particularly impressed by the toilet, which they held in ritual importance and called “the most meritorious gift” to be given in royal donations and political treaties. \n\nMeanwhile, the more peaceful South had risen as the center of worldwide trade and commerce, as well as a host for Jewish and Christian refugees from the Roman Empire. The Deccan Empire facilitated the transmission of ideas between North and South, and traded extensively with the Romans as well as the East. The Deccan was a hub of metallurgy, alchemy and mechanical engineering, and Pratishthana was major a center of philosophy. In particular, the region gave birth to the Mahayana school of Buddhism, which was more open for debate and interaction with other Indian philosophies than was traditional Buddhism. \n\nKalinga also reached a period of prosperity, patronizing in particular Jain scholars; while Brahmin scholars seemed to have turned their eye away from mathematics in this period, instead focusing on things like legal theory, the baton was picked up by Jain mathematicians who made a wide array of contributions to the traditional subjects of Indian mathematics.\n\n**Classical Age: Second Golden Age (250 – 543)**\n\nThe Magadhan Empire re-rose to prominence under the Gupta dynasty. Like the Mauryas before them, the Guptas were probably also of non-Kshatriya (either Vaishya or Brahmin) birth and were foreign to Magadha (originating in Ayodhya or Mathura) – they patronized the Vishnu cult, and held the mythical eagle Garuda as their motif.\n\nThe Gupta period saw significant advances in mathematics, astronomy and metallurgy as well as the flourishing of literature and culture. Many of India’s greatest classical scientists (e.g. Aryabhata, Varahamira) date to this period, and the university of Nalanda was founded during the period. Much of earlier literature – including academic treatises and epics – were canonized in this period, and the period saw the birth of a historiographic tradition. \n\nThis period also saw the convergence of Vedic and Buddhist philosophies. The Mahayana school that had originated in the South became popular among Buddhist scholars in Gupta universities, and discussed topics of philosophy and logic without too much concern for ascetism. Vedic philosophy, which did not have a formal proselytic tradition to preach to the masses as such, allied itself with various local and rural cults (e.g. various rural cults were unified under the banner of Shaivism, several elite theistic movements were unified under the banner of Vaishnavism). Public Hindu temples became commonplace, tour guides were published and circulated for various cities and sites marketing them as pilgrimage locations. Carvaka was also apparently no longer considered part of the Vedic lore. \n\nThe history of the caste system also becomes worth mentioning here: the caste system was initially developed as a social theory by Yajnavalkya in the Middle Iron Age, and was strictly occupational (see e.g. the tale of [Satyakama Jabala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyakama_Jabala)); by the end of the Late Iron Age, caste-segregated cities were a thing, and during the Invasions period legal theorists advocated for giving a legal basis for caste – even the school of Kautilya asked for heavy fines on Shudras pretending to be Brahmins, although they allowed the son of an upper-caste father by a lower-caste mother to take the caste of his father if he were “sufficiently manly”. By the Gupta era, earlier Indian hygiene norms had been codified into the more religious notion of “purity” and used as a religious basis for caste; thus intercaste marriages ceased. \n\nA second wave of invasions – this time by the Huns – began c. 460 AD. While the Magadhan empire successfully repelled these attacks, the wars drained the state treasury and the Huns sacked several cities, destroying the ancient university of Taxila. The Huns were eventually expelled from India by an alliance of Indian states led by the Ujjain Empire under Yashodharman, who also annexed much of the territory held by the now-weakened Magadha.\n\n**Classical Age: Intermediary period (544 – 749)**\n\nThis period begins with the end of the Gupta dynasty and ends with the beginning of the Tripartite struggle for Kannauj.\n\nThe main development of this period is the decline of Magadha as a region of relevance after 1000 years of political dominance over India. Indian science moves Westward and Southward, with mathematicians such as Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I hailing from Ujjain and the Deccan respectively.\n\n**Classical Age: Third Golden Age (750 – 1194)**\n\nThe Third Golden Age is the golden age of Southern India, beginning with the ascendancy of the Rashtrakutas to the Deccan Throne, which moves Southward from Pratishthana to Manyakheta, a city in North Karnataka metropolis. Brahmin and Jain mathematicians flourish in the Deccan Empire, and vast architectural projects are undertaken near Pratishthana.\n\nIn the North-West, Arab invasions slowly expanded Islamic influence in the Pakistan region, but were held off by the Ujjain Empire under the Pratihara (“Gate-keeper”) dynasty. Astronomy continued to flourish in Ujjain even after the fall of the Pratiharas in the 11th century, with the famed scholar-king Bhoja reigning in this period. Meanwhile, the Magadhan Empire was no longer based in Magadha, with their capital now moved into the Anga region under the Pala dynasty. The period saw a 200-year long tripartite war (750–950) between the three empires for control over the Gangetic metropolis of Kannauj.\n\nThe Vedanta philosophy expanded in popularity among the elite, replacing both more rationalistic schools (such as Nyaya and Samkhya) as well as less rationalistic ones (such as Buddhism). While Shankara’s school of Non-Dualism is still not really theistic in a technical sense, Madhava’s Dualism is thoroughly theistic and religious.\n\nIn the Tamil country in the far South, the Chola empire overthrew the reigning Pallavas, bringing an end to six centuries of non-Tamil rule. The Cholas were a powerful imperial power, controlling much of South-East Asia at their peak. The Cholas’ contribution to naval engineering was extensive, and had a large influence on Arab and Chinese shipbuilding.\n\nAs a result of the historical prominence of Indian merchants (which had albeit declined during this period), Indian mathematics (as well as astronomy, medicine) had a large influence on the Muslim world (the famous developments of the Islamic Golden Age were largely based on Indian innovations) and later the West. The most important of these influences was on Fibonacci, who brought the sciences back into Europe and put an end to the European Dark Ages.\n\nOn the other hand, influences from the outside were greatly reduced, and India failed to adopt the various innovations of the Tang-Song Golden Age of China.\n\n**Dark Ages: Muslim period (1195 – 1669)**\n\nThe Dark Ages of India begin with the invasions of the Turk Muhammad Ghori, whose slave Qutb al-Din Aibak established the Delhi empire. This was the first of the many Muslim invasions of India, several of which established new dynasties centered around the Delhi region, such as Timur’s Sayyid dynasty and Babur’s infamous Mughal dynasty. The Dark Ages reached different regions of India at different points in time – in the South, classical Indian civilization prospered until the Battle of Talikota in 1565. \n\nThe period saw the destruction of Indian cities, the systematic burning of Indian universities, libraries and temples, the imposition of high taxes and idiotic economic interventions and the widespread persecution and genocide of non-Muslims (the standard reported death toll of these wars is 80 million – while this number is exaggerated due to the inclusion of deaths by disease and non-civilian deaths, the order of magnitude is right). Shitty cultural practices like slavery, widow-burning and child marriage became vastly more prevalent, Hindu philosophy completed its transformation into a religion, and India became a largely irrelevant region of the world, its fraction of the world economy having declined considerably.\n\nThe sole exception to the widespread crappiness of the period was the rule of the Mughal Emperor Akbar (reign 1556-1605), who enacted several economic and social reforms, appointed Hindu ministers and partially Indianized the court style. He grew disaffected with Islam, holding religious debates at the famously free [Ibadat Khana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadat_Khana) and eventually left the religion mid-way into his reign for *Din-i-Ilahi*, a syncretic cult of his own creation. The Indian fraction of the world economy expanded during his reign for the first time in centuries, particularly fueled by the growth of the textile industry in Bengal. It is to the period of Akbar (and about two generations after him) that we owe the fancy wealthy picture of the Mughals, prior to which they lived in tents and ate rats.\n\n&gt;As most men are fettered by bonds of tradition, and by imitating ways followed by their fathers… everyone continues, without investigating their arguments and reasons, to follow the religion in which he was born and educated, thus excluding himself from the possibility of ascertaining the truth, which is the noblest aim of the human intellect.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Akbar, in a letter to King Phillip II of Spain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thus we see in this Prince \\[Akbar\\] the common fault of the atheist, who refuses to make reason subservient to faith, and accepting nothing as true which his feeble mind is unable to fathom, is content to submit to his own imperfect judgement matters transcending the highest limits of human understanding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;– Jesuit missionaries on Akbar.\n\nAkbar’s reforms prompted several rebellions and attempted coups, and were gradually undone by his successors, particularly by his great-grandson Aurangazeb, who was pretty much worthless.\n\n(I’m aware that many on this sub dislike Akbar for various brutalities he committed in his wars; I’m not really knowledgeable to comment on these, regardless I think it’s reasonable to speak well of someone’s positive accomplishments. For someone born to a barbarian dynasty of nomads, his achievements are no small feats.)\n\n**Dark Ages: Reconquest period (1670 – 1756)**\n\nThe final leg of premodern Indian history was the reconquest of the country by Indic powers – most importantly Shivaji’s Maratha empire, but also Mysore and the Sikh dynasty. \n\nThe Marathas under Shivaji, who initially scored his victories through guerilla warfare and cunning, eventually received the backing of many financiers and landlords dissatisfied with Mughal rule. Shivaji was a remarkably enlightened ruler; he embraced Vedic rituals and governance policies, he was open to trade and adoption of foreign technologies, he regarded his conquests as a constructive enterprise rather than mere revenge against Muslim rule.\n\nThe Maratha Empire reduced the excessive bureaucratic overhead and statism that had been introduced by Muslim rule, reducing taxes and abolishing religious persecution. However many later Maratha rulers would be relatively underwhelming in foreign policy, particularly after the empire decentralized into a confederacy. While the consequences of the Maratha raids in Bengal may be exaggerated, it is clear they lacked the required control on mercenaries and such; Baji Rao I’s successors also seemed unable to sustain his territorial expansions."<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'q92z5p'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q92z5p/a_political_history_of_premodern_india_1200_bc/</li>

This works because people can generally be swayed by feelings over logical reasoning.\n\nTake the US for example:\n\nTrump in 2016 created a scare of immigrants coming in to take American jobs and commit crime.\n\nBiden’s campaign in 2020 basically relied on the ‘scare’ of another Trump term.\n\nAlthough Modi’s 2014 campaign was centered around the fear of a failing economy, inflation and corruption during the previous government, the 2019 election and the Modi wave over the last few years has been fueled, at least partially, by Hindutva.

Response to someone (Pakistani) saying India &amp; Indian Subcontinent are not related, and that Western Pakistan was never part of Indian Civilization. Might be a good reference to people interested in this.'<br />Body: ' Not really. If we’re keeping this good faith and non-jingoistic open-minded...\n\nAround  Alexander\'s time, they considered having entered India \\*before\\*  Swat/Chitral... aka on the other side of the Durand. Achaemenid  administrative sources seem to treat satrapies West of the Hindush  (Indus) province as also (ambiguously) India.  \nThe regions of Kunar,  Nangarhar &amp; Nuristan (aka Kafiristan) and Bargam were generally the  frontier regions of the Civilization - having greater or lesser  influence depending on the epoch.  \nThe ancient Indian polity of  Gandhara was in KP, with \xa0bits in Af. Peshawar, Taxila etc are all  non-controversially Indic sites and they hug the Western border of Pak.\n\n  \nThe  Parthians considered the region of present-day Kandahar (named after  the aforementioned Gandhara) "White India". Zabul too at various point  was ruled by Indic polities.  \nIn fact, if we look it from a ‘who is ruling’ perspective, parts of Eastern Afghanistan  \n(especially in the Northern half) have often been ruled Indic/Indian rulers…  \nsometimes with the seat of the polity also being in Afghanistan.\n\n  \nXuanzang,  (7th Century) considered himself to have been in India when he passed  through what are Kapisa (incidentally an Indic name) &amp; Laghman  provinces in Afg today. (He considered Bamiyan to Not be India, despite  mentioning natives worshiping Hindu deities there).\n\n  \nBalochistan, aka Gerodosia was a barren wasteland, so it was either way it  \nwasn\'t really counted and considered a separator... Eastern parts near Sindh,  \nwhich  still have the Dravidian-speaking Brahui (aka Kalat and East of it) are  reasonable to consider "Indic". The migration of Baloch speakers from  the Iranian plateau happened much later.\n\n  \nI have tried my best to keep  away purely Indian references. For obvious reasons. That\'s the cultural  argument. Of course, "sub-continent" being a geographical entity, I  think using the Indian tectonic plate as proxy for a geographical  definition, leads to similar results.\n\n  \nIf you will allow me to make  a somewhat political attack at your point (you can choose to ignore it,  but I hope that won\'t let it colour your view on the rest of what I  have said) -  \nThere is a nationalistic need in Pakistan to lean into  non-Indian heritage. Denying Punjab &amp; Sindh as \'Indian\' is quite  difficult and so believing that large territories  \nin modern-day Pak  were not “Indian” at some point can help alleviate that inconvenience.  There is also felt a need to lean heavily into "Afghan" genes &amp;  heritage, for similar reasons, and the idea that those regions too had  as Indian a past as Punjab/Sindh may be difficult to square with the  narrative.\n\n  \nThe truth is, that the KP-to-Kashmir belt, at various points in time, were most vibrant parts of Indian civilization.\n\n  \nAgain, I apologise for the political point at the end, though not the history spiel.'<br />Author: 'fingolfd'  id: 'q848q9'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q848q9/my_post_in_another_forum_regarding_what_were_the/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Indian Streaming platforms are actively pushing a value system change'<br />Body: 'Amazon, Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar commission original productions that are tailor made for the web platform. It is well known that especially Amazon and NF take full advantage of the lenient regulatory framework for web programming to push the envelope of acceptability when it comes to sexuality and violence. \n\nWhat is less well known is that they have programming guidelines that are against traditional Indian values and seek to aggressively push a Western liberal agenda on the Indian audience.\n\nThis means there won\'t be any Ramayan / Mahabharat type of Indic programming generally, and even if one is made it will be heavily filtered through a western liberal lens. \n\nI\'ve learned from some movie maker friends in the past that these web companies have script approval rights and do often insist on story line changes to accommodate their pet agenda even if it is not germane to the subject.\n\nSay there is an innocent romance between a boy and a girl, a program executive from these corporates will say, why don\'t you include a scene where they are making out after school, or where they buy a condom? Or show an unhappy marriage and imply the woman finds love in another man or woman. The modern woman should not be Sati Savitri, but instead be one who puts her short term needs selfishly ahead of the long term well being of the family and the marriage.\n\nTheir favorite topics are pre-marital sex, gay lifestyle, casual hookups, public intoxication, infidelity, a lifestyle that worships money, dark crimes etc.\n\nThese topics often sell because of the taboo factor. They are obviously doing it to stand out in the market, and sure, that is capitalism, but there\'s also a calculated long term angle. They want an India which is full of individualists who need to entertain themselves with Netflix whenever they are desperate and lonely, which they will become if they are raised on such values.\n\nOld marketing research from the 60s found that divorced families consume twice as much as families that stay together - two refrigerators, two TVs, two sofas etc. Which is why modern ad films even in India never show large families, but a couple or a couple and one child and one dog.\n\nYou will not easily find programming that promotes sanskari values, or sanatani ideas of sacrifice for the greater good, unless the Director / Storyteller is very strong willed and pushes back against the programming directives. Since an offer to Direct from Amazon or NF can be a once in a lifetime opportunity, few directors are that brave.\n\nTake for example, the Russian federal law ["for the Purpose of Protecting Children from Information Advocating for a Denial of Traditional Family Values"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_gay_propaganda_law). You can see Wikipedia calls it pejoratively the Gay Propaganda Law, including in the URL instead of by its official name. \n\n&gt; The Russian government\'s stated purpose for the law is to protect children from being exposed to homosexuality—content presenting homosexuality as being a norm in society—under the argument that it contradicts traditional family values. The statute amended the country\'s child protection law and the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses, to prohibit the distribution of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" among minors. This definition includes materials that "raises interest in" such relationships, cause minors to "form non-traditional sexual predispositions", or "[present] distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships." Businesses and organizations can also be forced to temporarily cease operations if convicted under the law, and foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported.\n\nWe need a law that protects traditional Indian values. Nobody wants a totalitarian state that stifles free expression, but you can\'t have a systematic destruction of culture for short term profits and other motives.\n\nLooking at Tamil cinema of the last 50 years it is very clear how the Dravidian parties have pushed a certain value system change through their control of Tamil cinema. Movies based on family values slowly started to dry up in the 80s, and by the 90s they were few and far between, whereas romantic movies flourished, especially ones that promoted a lower caste or poor hero aspiring for a rich girl who would also be upper caste. The clash of social class, caste, religion was a very useful tool to sell a new land of dreams under the socialist &amp; atheist Dravidian value system achieved through violent conflict. \n\nThis mischief of two decades has led to a lot of violence today between parents and children. \n\nThese liberal ideas which sound exciting at first, of a classless, casteless utopia where everyone gets everything is highly unrealistic and only works on screen. In real life they lead to a lot of violence and broken lives.\n\nThe same is true of the Netflix style propaganda programming - a  sexually promiscuous lifestyle or a permanently intoxicated life may sound exciting at first, but the long term consequences in life are not wholesome. James Bond never wakes up with a hangover or an STD, or emotional stunting due to abuse of sex and alcohol, but [that is exactly what would happen](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-25349738).'<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'q81qzs'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q81qzs/indian_streaming_platforms_are_actively_pushing_a/</li>

There 'brahminical patriarchy' (gives me those The Wire or The Quint vibes) and women were 'oppressed' and were of 'low status' as, the book claims, attested by Jain, Buddhist, 'Brahminical' texts.\n\n4.

Crimes were punished by retributive law 'tooth for a tooth, eye for an eye'. \n\nI read today that there is a claim in NCERT that says Islam teaches equality, one god, etc. and that is what inspired Bhakti movement.

      <li>Title::: "Kraut's New Video : Mistakes and Inaccuracies"<br />Body: 'Recently a well known YouTuber, whose channel name is Kraut, made a video, comparing the processes of socio-political change and evolution that have come to define the modern day nation states of India and China. The video made observations on the history of these nation states, to ascertain why the two societies are the way they are today, which characteristics and phenomenons shaped them and compares them as well. I shall link the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c4uO9ZGfbc) and I shall provide time stamps wherever possible. I will also paraphrase the video and I shall try to remain as accurate to the video as possible in terms of wording, however I do suggest giving this video a watch.\n\nFinally, I would also like to say, that while I find myself agreeing with the overall point that Kraut makes in the video, I find his observations on Indian history questionable and many of his points seem to misrepresent Indian history. It is for a correction of these points, that this post is intended. With all of this said, we can begin.\n\n\n\n**9:00 to 9:40**\n\n\n&gt;Brahmic religions played a core role in the creation of the first social structures of India.....\n\n\n&gt;A society of castes developed called "Varnas" \n\n\n&gt;Untouchables, divided into "Daltis", "Harijans" and "Pariahs" \n\n\nWe can begin by addressing this section where Kraut touches upon the emergence of social structures in India. Here, the claim is that it was the Brahmin religions that created the first social structures in India, these being Varnas and Jatis. The Brahmins or priestly class being at the top of this heirarchial structure and the Kshatriya or warrior class below them, the Vaishyas or aristocratic/merchant class below them, and the Shudras or labour class below them as well. While the untouchables, namely the "Daltis", harijans and pariahs being outside of this 4 fold structure. (Note : Astute observers of Indian history will notice that Kraut says "Daltis" instead of "Dalits") \n\n\nThese statements appear to be vague, and are not reflective of the social processes that led to the emergence of Jatis and Varnas and neither do they place the development of social structures in India in the appropriate order and context. Let us try and piece together these rather generalised and seemingly synonymous terms.\n\n\nTo begin with, we need to understand the process of development of social structures in the Indian subcontinent . According to Romila Thapar in *Early India : From The Origins To AD 1300*, 2002, p. 64 :\n\n\n*"The urban Harappan cultures indicate more complex systems, probably with a clear differentiation between those in authority controlling the production of the cities and those who laboured for them. The theory that might have legitimised this is not easily discernible from the excavated data, but the social heriarchies are evident. Peasant cultivators and pastoralists fed the cities, labour of various kinds was employed in their construction and maintenance, artisans were the producers of goods for exchange and there was the overall authority controlling distribution and asserting governmental powers. Such a society may well have been based on a heriarchy of Jatis and the differentiation between those who produced and those who controlled was doubtless legitimised through and ideology, probably religious."*\n\n\nAlso, the following is asserted by Ram Sharan Sharma, *India\'s Ancient Past*, 2005, p. 81 :\n\n\n*"Exacavations indicate a hierarchy in social habitation...... The citadel or the first locality was where the ruling class lived and the lower tower was where the common people dwelt. The middle settlement may have been meant for beaurocrats and middle-class merchants."*\n\n\n\nTherefore, the preconditions to the emergence of a caste system, predated the Brahmin religions in the subcontinent, namely social disparaties, inequal access to economic resources, and the legitimization of these inequalities via supernatural authority making these hierarchical structures irreversible. Now the arrival of the Indo-Aryans intruduced new migrants to these regions where the pre-existing culture of presumably birth based social divisions backed by ideological authority existed, although was in decline for quite some time. The Steppe Pastoralists, were already organised into a clan, kin and tribe centric society. It was the interaction between these societies and the power dynamics between them that gave rise to the later Vedic society, and it is in the later parts of the Rig Veda, namely Book 10, that we find the first mentions of the 4 varnas. As even RS Sharma mentions in *India\'s Ancient Past* that in earlier Vedic society *"The tribal society was divided into three occupational groups, warriors, priests and the common people on the same pattern as in Iran"* p. 113.\n\n\nLastly, the usage of the terms Dalit and Harijan to refer specifically to the untouchables began in the 19th and 20th centuries respectively. Meanwhile there were indeed pariahs in the later Vedic and medieval Indian societies.\n\n\n**10:00 to 11:00**\n\n\n&gt;Brahmins restricted literacy to their own caste..... \n\n\n&gt;Being the only ones who could read not only meant that Brahmins had monopoly on interpreting of religious laws but also meant that no centralised state could emerge\n\n\n&gt;Aristocratic and warrior castes willingly subordinated themselves to the Brahmin caste.... Social and economic mobility was severely restricted.\n\n\nNow we can begin addressing these points one by one, however before we do, the overall criticism of this part of the video, is the fact that it assigns to ancient and medieval Indian society this level of rest and stagnation, which does not reflect the incredibly dynamic and dramatic forces that were constantly at play in India in this period where multiple cultures came into contact with and were absorbed into the Vedic and later Puranic whole and where social groups and categories constantly took shape and fluctuated in agency and status.\n\n\n1) The claim that the Brahmins restricted the access to literacy generalises a large period in ancient history during which Indian society evidently had tendencies which present a different picture. First and foremost, we have the example of the *shrenis*. The closest equivalent of these in European understanding can be a "guild" however these were two similar though not identical institutions. These *shrenis* according to Romila Thapar (*Early India : From The Origins Of To AD 1300*, p. 248, p. 257) did more than merely provide security of products, organisation, standardisation and economies of scale and market competitiveness, they also created a system of record keeping, and account management. Which meant that guilds facilitated education. As according to Thaplyal (1996) p.176-179, as quoted in Upinder Singh in *A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India : From The Stone Age to the 12th Century*, 2008 :\n\n\n*"A Nashik inscription belonging to the reign of the Kshatrapa ruler Nahapana records a permanent investment of 3,000 and karshapanas made by the King\'s son-in-law, Ushavadata. 2,000 karshapanas were invested by him with a weaver\'s build of Govardhana (Nashik) at 1% rate of interest and 1,000 karshapanas were invested with another weaver\'s guild of the place at the interest rate of 3/4 th % per month."*\n\n\nMoreover, Upinder Singh also notes that there were, according to the *Milindapanha* as many as 60 crafts and according to the works of Moti Chandra (1977), KK Thaplyal (1996)and HP Ray (1986), there were around 20 different types of guilds for different professions. Therefore basic literacy and knowledge of maintaining accounts was certainly not entirely restricted to the Brahmins.\n\n\nWe have another example in the case of the Buddhist *sanghas* and Jain monastic orders, which produced a vast corpus of literary sources and records, where those who became members of these orders, were from the merchant as well as Kshatriya clans and castes. This brings me to my second point...\n\n\n2) The idea that the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas willingly accepted Brahminical authority, once again portrays Indian society as one which was stagnated and at a state of rest. There was certainly friction between castes and these manifested themselves into the literary sources and the stories that the didactic texts depict as well as in the socio-religious movements that took shape and gained traction in the later Vedic and the pre-Mauryan and Mauryan eras. For example according to Ram Sharan Sharma, *India\'s Ancient Past*, p. 131,\n\n\n*"Naturally the varna divided society seems to have generate tensions. We have no means of ascertaining the reactions of the Vaishyas and the Shudras, but the Kshatriyas, who functioned as rulers, reacted strongly against the ritualistic domination of the Brahmanas, and seem to have led a kind of protest movement against the importance attached to birth (jati) in the varna system. The Kshatriya reaction against the domination of the Brahmanas, who claimed privileges, was one cause of the new religions. Vardhmana Mahavira, who really founded Jainism, and Gautama Buddha who founded Buddhism, belonged to the Kshatriya clan, and both disputed the authority of the Brahmanas."*\n\n\nThis finally brings me to the last point I\'d like to make in this section\n\n\n3) The claim that the monopoly of interpretation of religious scriptures by the Brahmins resulted in no centralised states emerging in ancient India, is demonstrably incorrect namely in the emergence of powerful and vast Empires like the Mauryans and the Guptas in this period, with varying degrees of centralisation.\n\n\n\n**11:20 to 14:30**\n\n\n&gt;A Brahmin who even looked at a member of the lower jatis had to undergo an extensive religious ritual of self purification\n\n\n&gt;No social mobility\n\n\n&gt;refers to ancient Indian poltical entities as "Princley States" \n\n\n&gt;Brahmins owned no land and couldn\'t raise armies\n\nThis section of the video seems to based on the understanding that scriptures dictated social life in Indian antiquity, as well as the idea that the scriptural dictates applied equally and were observed with identical discipline by all castes in Indian history. Even in the case of the Brahmin, while the claim of ritual purity accorded them the highest social status and absolute purity, it did not however mean that Brahmins were a homogenous social category, or that scriptural dictates were literally followed.\n\nReligious scriptures contradicted each other quite often, and while the usual duties of a Brahmin were priestly work and education, we find instances of Brahmins engaging in military service in the epics and even in the Rig Veda, and even becoming kings in the Classical Period such as the Shungas, Satvahanas and Guptas. Thus, practicality and needs took precedent over scripture. Similarly we find instances of Kshatriyas becoming sages, and following the path of a hermit or sage, a path considered to be the domain of the priestly class. Therefore, contrary to scripture, it was not uncommon to find Brahmins engaged in military work. However, such exceptions, were exclusive to the upper echelons of the caste structure, meaning while Brahmin soldiers *could* be a common sight, Dalit land owners were definitely not.\n\n\nThe fact that Brahmins owned lands is indisputable, since the rise of Brahmin dynasties that came to rule kingdoms and Empires, and the royal land grants called *Brahmadeya* which record land being granted exclusively to Brahmin beneficiaries render this fact well established. There can be a discussion as to the nature and purpose of the *Brahmadeya*. But that Brahmins owned land is an established fact.  It would be to record these large numbers of *Brahmadeya* land grants that a scribal caste such as the Kayashtas emerged. \n\n\nThe sheer weight of examples of social mobility provide evidence against the claims in this section as well. We can start by looking at the Mauryans themselves. The Mauryans, according to the Brahminical sources were Shudras, and yet, managed to establish the largest and most powerful Empire in South Asian antiquity until the rise of the Guptas. There was also the rise of ambiguous caste groups such as the Kayasthas, a scribe caste whose existence in the ancient era is recorded and established as early as the Gupta Era, in the Damodar plate inscriptions which record a functionary by their post *prathama-kayashta*. Later on these occupational/scribal castes solidified into caste groups and the Kayasthas emerged as regular features in Indian courts from the early medieval period. This also contradicts the assertion of the previous section which claimed the Brahmins monopolised literacy, seeing as clearly it simply isn\'t evident and wasn\'t feasibly possible. Now this is not to say that there was large scale social mobility throughout the subcontinent or widespread literacy accross all social groups, but there is a clear trend of as of yet unsolidified ambiguous occupational groups, seeking and carving out a place for themselves, of economic and social mobility facilitated through occupation.\n\n\nWith this I arrive at a more trivial point of this section. Kraut refers to ancient poltical entities in the subcontinent as "Princely States" and uses this terminology when referring to the Mahajanapadas. Historians like RS Sharma, Romila Thapar and Upinder Singh have argued that these can be considered chiefdoms, or kingdoms, or oligarchies and even tribal confederacies. However, princely states as a term of reference is inappropriate in the context of these states. However pedantic this point may seem, I felt compelled to mention it.\n\n\n**15:00 to 16:00**\n\n\n&gt;Mobilisation was slow\n\n\n&gt;New military tactics and modern equipment were shunned\n\n\n&gt;Indian kingdoms never adopted cavalry archers, or the fact that they never gave up on using war elephants long after they were rendered ineffective by pikes, horse archers or gunpowder, or modernised it\'s military structure into a merit based system..... Is why India was unable to defend itself from Greek, Persian, Hunnic or Islamic invasions.\n\n\n&gt;Internal expansion by individual Indian states was limited\n\n\nIndian military history can be characterised as one which saw the military systems of the various poltical entities that emerged in the subcontinent go through periods of stagnation and conservatism while at the same time incredible pragmatism and flexibility. It has been stated by Upinder Singh and is evident from the primary evidence available, that during the era of the 16 states or Mahajanapadas, those states such as Magadha which maintained standing armies and had access to vital resources such as iron, made headway and dominated and conquered their neighbour, until eventually Magadha emerged as the power paramount in the North. Upinder Singh also points out how Jaina texts state that Ajatshatru, of Magadha, utilised two innovative engines of war during his conflict with the Lichchhavis, one being the catapult and another being a chariot with an attached mace. (*A History Of Ancient And Early Medieval India From The Stone Age To The 12th century*) \n\n\nIt is evidently false that horse archers were never adopted by Indian armies. As early as the Satvahana empire we have depictions of horse archers in Indian sculptures. We also know that the Guptas maintained horse archers in their empire and quite a considerable number in the western frontier of their Empire, as is claimed by Kaushik Roy, RS Sharma, Upinder Singh and Romila Thapar and is evident from sources such as numismatic evidence portraying Gupta Kings with bow and arrow atop horses and literary sources such as the *Raghuvamsha* which clearly mentions horse archers allowing the Guptas to rout their enemies in the West.\n\n\nIt is contrary to the understanding of Indian military history to state that new technology or military equipment was shunned. Throughout their encounters with opposing armies Indian kingdoms and armies have constantly changed and innovated their military structures, doctrine, equipment etc. Apart from the previously stated example of the horse archers, we also have examples of the Rajputs, who are themselves examples of social mobility, but also, their adoption of a more cavalry centric mode of warfare owing to their encounters with the Turkic armies of the Delhi Sultanate, resulting in Rajput military systems being almost entirely cavalry oriented by the 15th century. Those interested in reading more may even look up my post on how the latest in European military thinking, technology and doctrine was adopted by Indian powers in the 18th century (although it began as early as the late 15th and early 16th). \n\n\nIt should also be noted that the Greek invasions were short lived and repulsed, Iranian invasion were in the western provinces and these regions naturally changed hands between eastern and western and northern and sourthern powers. The Hunnic invasion were by and large repulsed and a failure. And the "Islamic invasions", were repulsed many times over until the emergence of Ghazni and the Ghurids. \n\n\nNow to finish off, I\'d like to refer to the point made about war elephants and internal expansion. War elephants as engines of war were largely abandoned in North India by the late 17th century. By this time, these beasts served the purpose of logistics and the moving of big guns from the artillery train. This is not to say that they weren\'t used for war, or employed in the battlefield at all, but again, military understanding and innovation is not symmetrical accross vast spaces and accross multiple political entities. Lastly internal expansion was often extensive, and not limited by any definition of the word in any period of Indian history. This is evident to any student of Indian political or military history. And if it isn\'t I would suggest going through the sources I have so far mentioned.\n\n\n**25:00 to 26:00**\n\n&gt;Doesn\'t seem to have been much of an administration at all (in reference to the Mauryan Empire)\n\n\n&gt;No centralised system of governance at all\n\n\nThis will be the last section of the video that I critique. If there are sections that I still disagree with that I may not have critiqued, their omission from this post is due to the fact that I understand the claims made in these sections to be of a political nature and rather topical and not really something I\'d like to discuss in a bad "history" post.\n\n\nSo, to start off, there is the claim made about Mauryan administration and governance. Now like most aspects of history, this is as of yet a topic up for debate yet theories centre around the idea that there was either a lot or less centralisation than what primary sources claim. The idea of there being no centralisation is a bit far fetched. RS Sharma in *India\'s Ancient Past*, agrees that the Mauryans must have adopted an "elaborate system of administration" (p. 171). According to his interpretation of evidences he states "The Empire was divided into a number of provinces and each of these was under a Prince who was a scion of the Royal family. The provinces were divided into smaller units, and arrangements were made for both rural and urban administration." (p. 171)\n\n\nHowever, providing a critical analysis of the available evidence and reconsidering the existing historiography, Romila Thapar suggested that the incredible levels of centralisation evident in the Indica of Megasthenes and the Arthashastra of Kautilya, raise questions as to the feasibility of such an extensive system of administration. She proposed a theory of the centre (being the Magadhan capital of Pataliputra and its surrounding provinces), the core (being the emergent and urbanised settlements of Ujjain, Taxila etc) and the peripheries (being the forests and newly contacted or un-Sanskritised peoples). She argues that while the urban centres, their peripheries and the core of the Empire was certainly well administered, and showed signs of centralised control, it was the nature of this vast empire which ruled over numerous cultures and languages and regions which induced elements of delegation of power and authority which must have been necessary by practical and economic considerations. Upinder Singh provides a similar analysis and agrees with these assertions while also stressing the innovative ideas about kingship, governance and administration both civic and military that the Empire introduced and propagated setting a foundation for the states to come. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I say this again, I more or less agree with the overall argument of the video, it is simply the details that were presented to make the argument that I found troublesome. This is ofcourse not a condemnation of the creator of this video who has a number of videos on many topics and I obviously have not seen them nor do I claim to be an authority on those subjects. I hope the purpose of this post is understood and I hope you enjoyed reading it!

Of picking one\'s battles—**\n\n*338 BC.*\n\nOn the Eastern bank of the Indus river, past impenetrable walls of stone lay a densely-populated city of over 2000 acres laid out across four caste-segregated quadrants separated by roads. Further paved roads of great breadth ran across the city in a grid-like fashion, dividing it into sixteen equal units, each serviced by numerous smaller roads of a more chaotic character. \n\nManufactories, guild housing and innumerable markets lined the busiest streets: the city was itself a center for carpentry and engineering, and goods sourced and manufactured elsewhere – metals, both precious and practical, processed; tools and devices made from them; textiles and various fabrics; clothing and blankets made of them; papers made of cotton, palm-leaf and birch-bark; perfumes and soaps; pottery and other artisan crafts; ivory and various woods and stones; spices, herbs and farm produce; animals and the equipment that pertained to them – made their way to the city’s markets through various trade routes where they would be sold for coins, cattle and cowry shells.\n\nMultistorey housing was not as widespread here as it was in the Eastern cities, except among some prosperous households to whom these were a decorative luxury rather than a necessity arising from scarcity of land. Brick and stone were used more than wood here compared to the East, and while the majority of land use was residential, several facilities could be found in these residential areas. A small number of hospitals were present on the roads that divided the quadrants, and each quadrant housed its own unique facilities: the Kshatriya quadrant was dotted by stadiums and arenas that were used for various sporting and ceremonial events; the Vaishya and Shudra quadrants housed theatres and such facilities; and numerous ritual altars, stepwell reservoirs and gurukulas decorated the Brahmin quadrant. \n\nThis was not what made the glorious city of Taxila: this was what most prosperous cities of Vedic civilization looked like.\n\nNear the city centre and bearing the banner of the Solar Emblem, was the royal palace. Excluding government offices and the royal stables and arsenals, the palace itself was under 25 acres in size, despite its splendid and luxurious appearance. To its North at the very centre of the city were four large courtyards arranged in a two-by-two grid that totalled 50 acres in land area: these lands comprised the campus of the University of Taxila. \n\nOne of these courtyards was fully covered in thatched roof, and contained a vast collection of manuscripts, variable in their antiquity, from all over India – the remaining courtyards were variously used for seated instruction, debate, sports and arts. The undecorated yet spacious thatched houses that filled the edges between the courtyards housed the Professors and the students that lodged with them; at the very central intersection of the campus was a memorial shrine to the venerated Sage Uddalaka Aruni who, four centuries prior, had migrated to the region from Ayodhya and established the university, and to the local ruler Dipankara, who had accepted his teachings with reverence, thus founding the kingdom as it was known.\n\nThis was the glorious city of Taxila.\n\nBut Gandhara had many cities. From within the city you could not see much beyond its tall stone walls and some mountains in the distance. But if you were to exit the rectangular city by one of its eight doors – or by one of its many secret tunnels in case of emergencies – and cross the danger-filled waters of its moat by boat or by a lowered bridge, then cross the Indus river to its Western shore, then you would find yourself at Taxila’s twin city Pushkalavati.\n\nThe seat of Persian power in Gandhara.\n\nThat was a dirty little fact, which was secret to no one, yet one which nobody articulated too verbally, a stain on the very sovereignty of the Kingdom of Gandhara. \n\n*Gandhara was not an independent kingdom.*\n\nIt had not been an independent kingdom since the Persian conquest of Sindh and the Western Punjab \\[1\\] under Darayavaush (Darius) I. While the states of Sindh were engaged in constant rebellion and uprisings against Persia, Gandhara had negotiated an arrangement with the Persians that allowed them to best protect the kingdom’s policy of peace and neutrality that was necessary for the university to function.\n\nGandhara was taxed at a lower rate than Sindh and the other Persian satrapies were (but received no spending in return either), and was permitted to maintain its own laws and court rituals, and to independently enforce its own justice system without intervention from the Persian emperor. In return, the university was forced to admit a large number of Persians of noble birth as its students, and to maintain a department dedicated to those arts that Persian nobles were expected to learn. The kingdom was also required to supply the required numbers of elite Indian infantry, cavalry and elephantry corps to the Persian army; and the university had at several points been asked to provide instruction to the imperial government to facilitate the adoption of Indian military technologies. \n\nThis had been the state of affairs for the last one hundred and eighty years. \n\n“Yajnyapati,” Professor Rishyasringa addressed his student, “What makes a man civilized, and what distinguishes a civilized man from a barbarian?”\n\n“It is his precision of speech and pronunciation that makes a man civilized,” said Yajnyapati. “Speaking only barbarous tongues, or speaking Sanskrit incorrectly makes a man a barbarian.”\n\n“But under those terms,” Chanakya interjected, “Most women and people of shudra birth would be classified as barbarians, as would all unlearned people of any caste. Yet few would say it is acceptable to enslave them, or that it is unacceptable for a man to marry any woman.”\n\n“Correct,” said Professor Rishyasringa. “The terms *civilized* and *barbarian* cannot used to designate individuals, only tribes. And language is emphasized only insofar as it is necessary to perform rituals that require hymns, and it is the performance of these rituals that are more immediately relevant to the designation of a tribe as civilized.”\n\nChanakya argued further: “But there are schools of philosophy that reject the central position of ritual in religion, as well as schools that reject religion altogether. If a king were to be influenced by such a philosophy, and as a consequence cease the performance of such rituals in his court, and successfully dissuade the people of his kingdom from officiating and undertaking such rituals, will his kingdom then become barbarian? And if a Scythian chief were to start performing the correct rituals, would he then be regarded as civilized and respectable on that basis alone?”\n\n“Certainly not. The correct performance of ritual requires an understanding of the ritual, which the Scythian would not possess regardless of his imitation of a civilized man. Without this understanding, a ritual becomes devoid of fruit.”\n\nThen Chanakya opined: “I believe, Professor, that it is the adoption of correct policies in government, not correct speech in ritual, that bears fruit to a kingdom. And thus my answer to your original question: it is the imposition of correct government policies that makes a people civilized, and the imposition of incorrect policies that makes a people barbarian. When particularly harmful policies are imposed, a tribe may cease to be urban, or even become nomadic, as is observed among the Scythians. When a tribe lives under the rule of barbarians, then its own support for correct policies and the effort it makes to implement the same, are what makes it civilized.”\n\nProfessor Rishyasringa smiled, intending to cease that conversation, and then joined it back to his own teachings on the question, which were in contrast to both Chanakya’s and Yajnyapati’s.\n\n“Indeed it is a combination of several traditions that makes a tribe civilized,” he taught, “Good laws are among them, as Chanakya rightly says, but so are ritual and its language, so is courtly and respectful behaviour. That is what makes the Persians civilized, even though they perform incorrect rituals in their court.”\n\nThis did not end the debate at all in Chanakya’s mind; indeed he objected to every word of that statement. For starters: “The Persians are most certainly *not* civilized.”\n\nProfessor Rishyasringa gave him a stern look. “The Persians exhibit many noble qualities, and these qualities must not be neglected. Even though their court rituals are technically incorrect, they are still not as incorrect as those practised by some other tribes.”\n\n“Nonetheless their people live in poverty as a result of their bad policies. Their few territories in India are by far the most prosperous parts of their empire. Gandhara is the most prosperous country in their empire and Sindhu, which we regard as a relative backwater of our own civilization, contributes a third of all revenue collected by the Persian government. Such is the starkness in the difference between our prosperity and theirs, that while all their other provinces pay their tributes in silver, only Gandhara and Sindh pay ours in gold.”\n\nProfessor Rishyasringa, wishing that Chanakya not press further on this matter, said simply that: “Being a prosperous people, it is righteous for us to be charitable towards the Persians.”\n\n“Theft is not the converse of charity — we are being *punished for our wealth*! Do you not see, professor? A country is not simply *born* with its wealth, it is policy that makes a country wealthy. It is not race that make a tribe civilized or barbarian, it is not our blood that makes us wealthier than the Persians – we are born with the same organs and all faculties as they do. Yet the policies and culture of our nations allow us to achieve greater goals than their people are allowed to by those of their nation; and when a barbarian tribe imposes its policies on a civilized one, the wealth that the latter would have created in that time frame is lost forever, it is *destroyed*!”\n\nProfessor Rishyasringa found his student’s manner of arguing rather odd – not so much that he kept pressing on this matter; indeed, Rishyasringa had been unable to articulate his desire to not discuss this subject, too embarrassed to say that there were subjects too taboo to be spoken of publicly in a university like Taxila – but he felt genuine discomfort in Chanakya’s desire to repeatedly circle the argument back to the matter of wealth and wealth alone.\n\n“Is wealth all that matters to you, Chanakya? What about charity? The service of the aged? The keeping to duties and oaths?”\n\n“Wealth *is* all that matters, Professor,” said Chanakya. “The keeping of oaths is desirable precisely to instill trust among creditors, and charity, service of the aged – these are only achievable through wealth. Indeed, the very cause for charity is the desirable goal that is the elimination of poverty, that is, the lack of wealth.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*So says Kautilya, that wealth and wealth alone is important, in as much as righteousness and pleasure depend upon wealth for their realisation.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.7:6-7\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWord of Chanakya’s debate with Professor Rishyasringa, and his foul words for the Achaemenid dynasty soon caught the attention of Vishtaspa, a student from a prominent Persian noble family which enjoyed a position quite close to the Imperial throne. \n\nVishtaspa knew better than to complain to his parents about such events at the university. They would hardly find a single student’s offensive words to be worth fighting a political battle over – no, that would not be worth their *status*. That was the nature of battle as he understood it – a warrior of high status did not prove his worth by fighting many battles, or by killing many enemy soldiers in battle; he proved his worth by picking crucial battles, and by killing enemy targets of importance. \n\nA warrior of high status expected his loyal subordinates to fight minor battles for him, and in this case, he was the loyal subordinate to his parents.\n\nThe nine-year-old Chanakya was found in the Library of Taxila, his eyes scouring over a manuscript on battlefield formations, and in his hands another manuscript on siege warfare.\n\nSurrounded by two minions, Vishtaspa approached him. \n\n“Chanakya!” he cried, attempting to modulate his voice to a cold tone and register to elicit the desired feeling of fear from the younger boy. “I wish to speak with you. Would this be an appropriate time?”\n\nWithout looking up from his book, Chanakya asked: “How long?”\n\nVishtaspa ignored him. “My name is Vishtaspa. I heard of what you said about the Persians, and wish to converse with you on this matter.”\n\n“I am glad that you have an interest in improving your government’s policy,” said Chanakya, looking cheery. “And I am willing to provide you any instruction you desire in the relevant sciences.”\n\n“You should know that the Persian empire does not tolerate such blasphemy against the throne.” Vishtaspa’s words were most icy. “Say what you wish to say about the kings of Gandhara and Sindh, that is up to your provincial rulers to handle. But you are a Persian subject, and must behave as such towards the emperor.”\n\n“Indeed, that is among the laws that causes me to regard you as barbarians.” Chanakya stood up, folding his hands sarcastically as he prepared to leave.\n\nWhether it was those words, or the attitude with which Chanakya mocked his master, this seemed to greatly incense Ariyaramna, one of the aforementioned minions, for he then angrily shoved Chanakya towards the ground.\n\n“Lay another finger on me,” said Chanakya, pulling himself back to his feet, “And I will break it off.”\n\nAriyaramna did so.\n\nChanakya did so.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Of divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule, or rule of a country by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality and rivalry. My teacher says that foreign rule which depends upon its winning the affection of the people is for the enjoyment of others in its own condition.* \n\n*No, says Kauṭilya: divided rule between father and son or between two brothers has similar consequences and is under the clutches of a minister. But foreign rule brought into existence by seizing the country from its king still alive thinks that the country is not its own, impoverishes it and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a commercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires, abandoning the country.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 8.2:5-8\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nChanakya found it frustrating that despite the eloquence in his manner of speaking on academic subjects and in debate, he still had no idea how to behave when being disciplined by a teacher. Vishtaspa, Ariyaramna and himself had been summoned to the Head Professor’s workspace, where Professor Chanaka had also been invited. Currently, the Head Professor was saying something about discipline and violence.\n\nAt last, Chanakya found his voice. \n\n“*Professor.* I believe the issue of my being assaulted over the thoughts I expressed is of far greater significance than that of me employing violence in defense of myself.”\n\n“You will not continue to defend your actions,” said the Head Professor, “and indeed you will no longer express any ill thoughts you may have about the Persian government, its people or its traditions. It is forbidden.”\n\n“You cannot *forbid*—” \n\n“The punishment will be expulsion.”\n\nChanakya looked helplessly towards Professor Chanaka, but the latter’s face betrayed no sympathy either.\n\n“And Vishtaspa,” said the Head Professor, “There is little that I can reprimand Ariyaramna over, as he is here in your service, and so you must decide the manner in which you discipline him. You must learn to control your friends, and to restrain them when they act in a way that is beneath their dignity.” \n\n“Forgive him, Professor,” said Vishtaspa, “He is simply loyal to the Empire and to its throne, as I am, and sometimes this feeling of loyalty overrides his better senses.” \n\nThe Head Professor continued: “And while princes at your age enjoy the euphoria of fighting, especially if they can justify it with a cause like *loyalty* or *honor* – I assure you that this is precisely the sort of matter that your father would not wish to hear of, or to see escalated to the level of politics.”\n\n“I understand, Professor,” Vishtaspa agreed, “And Chanakya, I regret the pain and humiliation that my dear friend caused you by treating you in such manner in a public place. I do, however, wish that you had responded in a more appropriate manner to his slight aggression.”\n\nBoth professors were staring at him expectantly, so Chanakya said through gritted teeth: “I ask for your forgiveness.”\n\nVishtaspa made a concillatory gesture. “You will see, Chanakya, that the Persians are a very big-hearted people.”\n\nChanakya resisted the urge to ask: *Do you wish me to garland him as well? Or perhaps I ought to touch lips with him out of respect for* that *Persian custom?*\n\n“You may leave now, Vishtaspa,” said the Head Professor. “Chanakya, stay.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*My teacher says that in an open war, both sides suffer by sustaining a heavy loss of men and money; and that even the king who wins a victory will appear as defeated in consequence of the loss of men and money. No, says Kautilya, even at considerable loss of men and money, the destruction of an enemy is desirable.* \n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 7.13:31-33\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“What was that, Professor?” Chanakya asked with indignance, then looked at Professor Chanaka. “And you too? That *vulture-feed* \\[2\\] dared to attack me, and you discipline me for raising my hand in self-defense?”\n\n“We live under the rule of the Persians, Chanakya,” said the Head Professor. “And as long as this is true, we must live under their rules as well, if we wish to live at all.”\n\n“What use is a life of apology?” spat Chanakya, then stopped, realizing he didn’t quite mean those words.\n\nThe Head Professor took his leave, allowing Professor Chanaka to speak with his student.\n\n“There are two matters that we must first settle before we address the matter of true importance,” Professor Chanaka announced, “First, here is the truth of the whole debacle of barbarians and the civilized. These terms have nothing to do with wealth, nor to do with the various features of a culture that Professor Rishyasringa listed—”\n\nChanakya raised his finger in objection, but Chanaka continued.\n\n“—Every known culture has a notion of *civilized* and *barbarian*, and classifies the cultures furthest from itself geographically, that is, outside some circle beyond its own boundary, as barbarian. This is motivated by nothing but the natural necessity of men to have an enemy, in order to allow themselves to believe there is something they must protect. It is possible – although also not permitted for you – for one to argue on the policies taken by the Persian government without referring to them as barbarians. Doing so only serves to satisfy this aforementioned emotional need. That is the truth of the matter, and all else is an attempt to base these arbitrary feelings in some rational cause that does not exist.”\n\nChanakya needed some time to process this fully.\n\nChanaka went on. “Indeed, if a Persian student came to you expressing his agreement with your more specific criticisms of the Persian empire, even as he continued to follow traditional Persian rituals, I believe you would then yourself refrain from referring to him as *vulture-feed*, and may even feel shame at your previous use of that term. These are words suited for a battlefield for a commander in need of raising his soldiers’ spirits by instilling anger at the enemy; they are not suitable at a university campus.”\n\nChanakya opened his mouth to speak, but Chanaka held out a hand. “I will not entertain any further debate on this matter, even privately. Not because it is too taboo to speak on, but because I believe that you do not truly have any sensible point of disagreement with my words, and will only argue in order to save face by seeking a concession from me on some matter of little importance. If after two days of peace you still have some objection to what I have expressed, you may then again privately meet with me for debate.\n\n“Second: you asked why I disciplined you more harshly than I did Vishtaspa and Ariyaramna. I will say this much: if a child is seen to be fighting with his playmate, his mother will discipline him regardless of who initiated the fight or who may be held guilty if the matter were taken to legal arbitrage, because she wishes to better her child, and holds no sway over the playmate that isn’t her own.”\n\n“I never held any appreciation for that argument, even when it was made to me by my own mother,” said Chanakya, “But on that same line of reasoning, the mother also makes provisions to protect her child from the dangers his playmate may cause him in future, or to simply prevent them from interacting. Vishtaspa and his minions are likely to continue to create nuisances in my way, and what you have done is deny me any means of defending myself or punishing him.”\n\nThis response made Professor Chanaka’s expression turn very grave, as if they were finally speaking of a matter of true importance.\n\n“That brings me to the main topic I wish to discuss with you, Vishnugupta. What, precisely, would you have done if we had not forbidden you from speaking against the Persian government?”\n\nChanakya stared.\n\n“To say that you would have *fought*, against Vishtaspa or indeed against the Persian government itself, is insufficient. What would you have done about all the consequences of such actions? Here would have been the consequences of your actions if hot-headed, indignant boys like you had populated the ranks of this university and of the government of Gandhara. First, Vishtaspa, to save his honor among his peers at Taxila, would escalate the matter to his own father. His father would then demand an audience with the King of Gandhara. Then the King of Gandhara, if he were also similar in manner to you, would refuse to comply, at which Vishtaspa’s father would submit an exaggerated and indignant report to the Emperor about the state of Persia-Gandhara relations. Then the Emperor of Persia would summon the King of Gandhara to his court, and subsequently when the king refuses to interfere in the matters of the university, order his replacement. If all the influential houses within Gandhara’s government were also of your nature and outlook, they would refuse and proclaim their loyalty to the King of Gandhara, at which the Persian Emperor would send his enormous army to the walls of Taxila. Loyal to their king and country, the armies of Gandhara will defend the city against an army that hopelessly outnumbers them, fighting till their last breaths. Gandhara will be denied the special treatment it has been receiving so far – to the contrary, the armies of Persia will reduce Taxila to flour, massacre our scholars, and burn every last manuscript in the library.”\n\nChanakya’s throat felt heavy.\n\nIf there were a hymn in the Vedas whose purpose was to utterly humiliate the addressee, this would have been its source text. \n\nIt destroyed his pride to hear these words. To hear that his professor considered him so foolish and rash, and rightfully so. To hear that he would have in his irresponsibility, for what now seemed so petty a purpose, caused the destruction of what was perhaps the last great center for Vedic civilization. To hear how *pathetically impotent* the glorious kingdom of Gandhara was at defending itself. \n\nBut most terribly of all, to have the fact reaffirmed that he wasn’t *free to speak*.\n\nFor any commoner, this desire quite probably seemed alien, for it was a feeling that could only be shared by a man who had ever had an original thought of his own, who had ever had something to say that was worth saying. Yet the fulfilment of this desire was an unstatably obvious goal among the Brahmins.\n\nChanakya had forever sought to pursue truth as the noblest goal, he had always held nothing to be more sacred than it, and had believed that to kill a thought was to point a sword to the neck of the Goddess Sarasvati herself. And now he was being asked to censor himself in fear of the Persian emperor, to hold more sacred than the truth his spectre.\n\nHe would have expressed these thoughts in as many words, but Professor Chanaka seemed to read his mind.\n\n“It is a tightrope to tread for a Brahmin with political ambitions,” he said, “For it is the truth and truth alone that a scholar must seek – and yet it is upon precisely these men to employ deception and strategy to achieve their political goals, for it is their intellect upon which all strategy rests. If you do pursue a career in politics, Vishnugupta, you will learn that you will not only need to omit the truth, but also to *lie*, to *betray* the truth in order to serve it. \n\n“Aryavarta lies divided between two empires of darkness: the Persians on the West and the Magadhas on the East, leaving in between only some militant confederacies of the Punjab and the ancient land of the Kurus that no longer retains its former glory. In Gandhara we pretend, out of fear of consequences, that it is only the Magadhas are objectionable, that the Persians allow us to be free and to maintain our own rules. But as these events demonstrate, as my own prohibition on you demonstrates, Gandhara is *not* free. The Vedic way of life, the culture of scholarship in which no sentence is unspeakable and no thought blasphemous, is dying out under the Persians in more ways than you too are aware. \n\n“It is not merely change that is needed, but a revolution. *You* have the capacity to lead this revolution, Vishnugupta; yet there is much that you need to learn first. I will quote back to you a sentence that you spoke earlier this year in one of my classes, which impressed me greatly: *a war whose outcome’s truth is known in advance to both sides should never be fought*. Yet those are the sorts of wars that spirited princes spend their lives fighting: in pursuit of victories that serve only to be undone shortly after, victories that even when in effect changed nothing but the symbol of a flag on a fortress, victories that will never distinguish their name in history. These princes have *spirit*, but no *ambition*. \n\n“You, on the other hand, Vishnugupta – I believe that *you* were born for greatness. If you seek to cause a true revolution, whose effects will be long-lasting, then you cannot act in the manner of such princes. You must learn to rise above foolish ideals like *honour* and *dignity*, and to fight for an actual goal. You must learn to identify this goal and understand what it means to achieve this goal, to learn the difference between *fighting* and *winning*.”\n\nAnd at last Professor Chanaka said those words that would one day come to define Chanakya’s life, that would for centuries forth become synonymous with his very name:\n\n“You must learn the art of *cunning*.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] Sindh, Western Punjab – regions of the Indian subcontinent contained in modern-day Pakistan. Gandhara was part of the latter.\n\n\\[2\\] *vulture-feed* – slur referring to the Persian practice of leaving the dead to be eaten by vultures. Obviously, I’m not condoning hatred towards Iranians or Zoroastrians, nor towards their history, much as my characterization of the Magadhans does not condone hatred towards the people of Southern Bihar. Indeed, these civilizations have made many significant contributions to the world and the descendants of medieval Zoroastrian immigrants are an impressively industrious and peaceful Indian community. My writing is intended to picturize the attitudes that likely prevailed as a result of political tensions of the time. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations.

      <li>Title::: 'What are the basic tenets and beliefs of the Indian right wing in general?'<br />Body: "I want to check my understanding of the Indian right wing in general so please correct me if I am wrong. Below are my understanding of the claims of the Indian right wing:\n\n1. There are no Aryans or Dravidians and all Hindus are native people in India since the formation of homo sapiens. Therefore, Hindus are the rightful owners of this land and people who believe in Abrahamic religions can stay in India but they have to follow the Indian constitution which should be decided by Hindus only (I got this impression from listening to Tejasvi Surya).\n\n2. The constitution is influenced too much by the British and we should abandon the current one for a constitution which have Hindu elements only - like dharma, back to jati/varna system, modelling punishment for crimes based on srutis, smritis and texts like Arthashastra. From the previous point, therefore, conservative Muslims and Christians have to agree with this. If they don't they may leave the country.\n\n3. There is widespread jihad in the forms of love jihad, marks jihad, taqqiya, etc. going on in which most Muslims actually pretend to be good citizens but are actually planning to hijack the population and then turn India into an Islamic State. Another thing that I have seen right wingers believing in the same spirit is that Muslims population growth do not follow the sigmoid growth curve which most species and other humans follow, but they follow an exponential growth curve till infinity because their religion says so.\n\n4. Since Muslim rulers came to India, India's conditions worsened be it economically, politically or socially. All Muslim rulers from Delhi Sultanate to Mughals were extremely evil people who raped, murdered and forcefully converted Hindus. Christians  are the same - they are foreigners who came to India and forcefully converted local populations to Christianity. Islam and Christianity are evil religions while Hinduism, or 'Sanatana Dharma' is the only good and true religion in this Universe. Before the coming of Muslim rulers, everything was good  in India and people lived peacefully, united in a nation named Bharat.\n\n5. Ayurveda is a scientific and valid form of medicine and the 'modern medicine' is actually 'western medicine' made by evil western people only to profit by promoting harmful chemicals. So, stuff like chakras, dosas, etc. are real. Vedas were written by enlightened munis and rishis all of whom understood Microbiology, advanced Chemistry, Quantum Mechanics, String theory, etc. thousands of years ago just by meditating and Vedas are the proof of that. Our society was very advanced and fruitful and all the knowledge was there in Nalanda University but unfortunately barbaric Muslim invaders came and destroyed most of our advanced knowledge. Modern 'western' scientists are only finding stuff that our yogis, munis and rishis knew all along. Also, Indian astrology is a valid Science from India and those who deny it are influenced by western Leftists and Liberals. Modern Science is also the direct result of ancient Indian science and all the developments of ancient medical science, chemistry, engineering, etc. in Egypt, Greece, China, etc. are all actually stolen from ancient India.\n\n6. Caste system - there is and was no 'caste' system in India, its just western classification that cannot capture the essence of Hindu scriptures and concepts. Its actually varna system which is actually a very efficient way to organize the society (and is actually better than any other foreign concepts). India should again start practicing varna system like back in the old days.\n\n7. Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas, etc. are completely historical. 'Ram Setu' is the evidence of that, there was really a demon in Sri Lanka who was defeated by Rama aided by Hanuman who actually carried a mountain on his back. Mahabharata, similarly was an actual historical event and the Gita isn't symbolical, as some people say, but it really happened in ancient times, in 4th millennium (an Art of Living guru said this on Twitter). Similarly, puranas are also historical and therefore Yugas are real and humans have been living on this planet for millions and millions of years in an infinite cycle. Modern Science is incomplete and western and because of this, cannot understand the reality of Yugas.\n\nThe above are my understanding about the Right Wing's beliefs. Next comes what I believe to be the Right Wing's plan of action:\n\n1. The Indian constitution should be dissolved and a new Hindu constitution based on srutis, smritis, Arthashastra, etc. should be made.\n\n2. India should be declared a Hindu country - a country for Hindus where other religions are tolerated but they have to agree with us on almost everything.\n\n3. Conversions from Hinduism to Abrahamic religions should be completely banned, marriage between Muslim and Christian men and Hindus should be also banned, and promotion of only Hindu dharma should be allowed. Action should be taken against couples like Shah Rukh-Gauri and Saif-Kareena.\n\n4. Our flag should be changed to a saffron only flag.\n\n5. J&amp;K's Muslims who do not agree with the Hindu constitution should be kicked out of the country. \n\n6. All the communists, liberals like staff of NDTV, left liberal journalists like Ravish Kumar should be arrested and punished. The opposition parties like Congress, CPIM, all the different regional parties like TMC, AAP, BSP, etc. should be banned. Wherever their government rule, President's rule should be applied.\n\n7. All Muslim refugees should be caught and kicked out. Muslim refugees should be banned in general.\n\n8. There should be a Law which says no city, village or the country as a whole, should allow the population of Muslims there to exceed 30-50%.\n\n9. All the temples destroyed by Islamic rulers should be rebuilt and the mosques should be destroyed.\n\n10. Modern medicine hospitals, pharmacies, etc. should be replaced with Ayurvedic ones only.\n\n11. History and 'western' Science books should be changed and replaced with Vedic knowledge. Indian history books will mostly focus on ancient India and the sages and Science books will be replaced with Surya Siddhanta, Susruta Samhita, and their likes only. All schools should be required to teach Vedas, Ramayana, etc. as part of the curriculum as part of India.\n\n12. Varna system should be brought back as a feature of Hindu constitution. Different rules will be applicable for brahmins, kashtriyas, vaishyas and shudras, like in Manusmriti.\n\n13. If possible, the Government should wage wars against Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to get India back to 'Akhand Bharat'. The wars would be called Dharmayudh.\n\n14. Cows should be declared as national and holy animal and beef consumption should be banned.\n\n15. Any speech that criticizes the basic tenets of Dharma or insults any God like Vishnu, Durga, Shiva, etc. should be severely punished.\n\nThe above are my understanding of the Indian Right, which I have got from watching Modi speeches, RSS speeches, Republic TV, Aaj Tak, Right wing friends and reading Opindia, Dharma Dispatch and SwarajyaMag.

The report went on to state that a few of them “were current in August 1975, and according to the CIA, they were used only for intelligence collection, or, in one case, for a minor role in preserving the cover of another asset.”**\n\n\nThe following excerpt from the Church Committee report speaks for itself and highlights the dangers of allowing foreign missionaries into India.\n\n**“[T]he CIA paid salaries, bonuses, or expenses to the religious personnel, or helped to fund projects run by them. Most of the individuals were used for covert action purposes. Several were involved in large covert action projects of the mid-sixties, which were directed at “competing” with communism in the Third World….**\n\nOf the recent relationships, the most damaging would appear to be that of a U.S. priest serving the CIA as an informant on student and religious dissidence.\n\n**Of the earlier cases, one exemplifies the extent to which the CIA used confidential pastoral relationships. The CIA used the pastor of a church in a Third World country as a “principal agent” to carry out covert action projects, and as a spotter, assessor, asset developer, and recruiter. He collected information on political developments and on personalities. He passed CIA propaganda to the local press.**\n\n**According to the CIA’s description of the case, the pastor’s analyses were based on his long-term friendships with the personalities, and the agents under him were “well known to him in his professional life.” At first the CIA provided only occasional gifts to the pastor in return for his services; later, for over ten years, the CIA paid him a salary that reached $11,414 annually.”**\n\n**The figure of $11,414 in this excerpt gives us a clue that the country in question is most likely India as this amount translates to a nice round figure of one lakh rupees using the currency exchange rate of the day. In addition to being a round figure, it was also a substantial amount of money in the 1970s in India.**\n\n\nMore details can be read in this IndiaFacts article: https://archive.is/fG8Jg\n_______________________________\n\n#Mayor Pete\'s aunt Marcette Buttigieg has been living for many years in Jharkhand, India -- in the "Red Corridor," where there has been a Maoist uprising for decades.She is a Maltese missionary and "social worker."\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1339288807070425089\n\nhttps://www.kaniewski.com/obituary/JosephA-Buttigieg\n\n#This Times of India 2002 article identified Mayor Pete\'s aunt Marcette Buttigieg as a "social worker" in poor villages in the "Red Corridor."Omits tha she\'s a Maltese missionary.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/1339290704061886465\n\n#Malta focus\n\n#High Commissioner of Malta visits the missionaries of Malta in Jharkhand &amp; Bengal.\n\n&gt;Between 24 December 2020 and 27 December 2020, the High Commissioner of the Republic of Malta in New Delhi, H.E. Mr. Reuben Gauci, accompanied by his wife, Dr. Olga V. Gauci and his daughter, Miss Alisa Gauci, together with Second Secretary responsible for cultural affairs, Ms. Eugenie Megally, embarked on a journey to Kolkata ( Calcutta)  in India’s West Bengal and Dumka in Jharkhand.\n\n&gt;**On the High Commissioner’s first stop in Kolkata, on Christmas Eve, the delegation met with Maltese Bro. Karmenu Duca of the Congregation of Saint Mother Teresa ( Missionaries of Charity ),** who very generously took the Maltese delegation to the tomb of Mother Teresa, which lies in the Mother House of the Missionaries of Charity run by the nuns of Mother Teresa, which was also Mother Teresa’s home. The Maltese High Commissioner was the first person to be received by the Mother House since India went on a nationwide lockdown in March 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic. \n\n&gt;**On Christmas day, the High Commissioner and his delegation embarked on a seven-hour car ride to Dumka in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. In Dumka, the delegation had the pleasure of meeting with Sr. Emanuela ( Emanuel ) Borg  ( known as taż-Żundajru ), Fr. Paul Aquilina SJ, Fr. Joseph Gauci Sacco SJ and Ms. Marcette Buttigieg, all missionaries in the state of Jharkhand. Sr. Emanuela Borg ( nun of the Sisters of Charity ), Fr. Paul Aquilina SJ and Fr. Joseph Gauci Sacco SJ, have been in India for over sixty years. They arrived in India in the late 1950s and have spent their lifetime educating the less privileged as well as caring for indigenous peoples in the region known as the Adivasi. Ms. Marcette Buttigieg  has been in India for the past forty years,** caring for the sick and for people with special needs, while also introducing new technologies and methods of education to communities which remain disconnected from the large metropolis.\n\n&gt;**These four outstanding people are the only remaining Maltese missionaries in Dumka. Through the years, they have managed to learn the local tribal languages of the Santals, Bengali and Hindi.** Their work, remarkable dedication and a lifetime of effort, is truly inspiring.**The pioneers of the Santal Mission in the region in the 1920s, were mostly Maltese Jesuits with only a couple of other missionaries from other European countries.**\n\n&gt;During this decade, the small town of Dumka hosted the Malta Mission Fund, a lay Catholic organisation, which, together with the Jesuits, built a school, a college, as well as a dormitory for college-level female students. The Government of Malta also funded a basketball pitch in 2014.\n\nhttps://foreignandeu.gov.mt/en/Embassies/Hc_New_Delhi/Pages/News/High-Commissioner-of-Malta-in-India,-H-E--Reuben-Gauci,-visits-Maltese-Religious-Community-in-Kolkata-(Calcutta)-and-Dumka.aspx\n\nOther Maltese articles recommending missionary work of Marcette Buttigieg in Jharkhand\n\nhttps://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/maltese-missionary-in-india-in-a-race-against-time-to-get-people-to-take-the-vaccine/\n\nhttps://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/announcements-july-19-2021.887581\n\nMarcette Buttigieg seeking missionary funds for her work in Mayurbhanj, Odisha\n\nhttps://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/helping-the-disabled-in-india.710998\n\n#&gt;Some Maltese Catholic groups have deep links with US intelligence.

Both far left &amp; far right sections have detailed Pete\'s work in intel. Pete himself has denied being a CIA asset.\n\n&gt;According to military documents that have gone mostly under the media’s radar, it does appear that the former mayor worked alongside the CIA while serving as a high-ranking Naval intelligence officer during his short stint in Afghanistan. \n\n&gt;Moreover, the unit Buttigieg supervised was a subset of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the US agency responsible for the disastrous war on drugs that has spawned humanitarian catastrophes throughout Latin America and much of the world.\n\n&gt;**‘We were working with everybody across the civilian spectrum in the intelligence community’\nEarly on in his military career, Pete Buttigieg worked as an intelligence analyst at US European Command, where he “conduct[ed] research and analysis of information to create accurate, timely intelligence products in support of USEUCOM theater operations,” according to mostly redacted military records released under the Freedom of Information Act.**\n\n&gt;Under a section labelled “command employment and command achievements,” Buttigieg’s papers indicate that intelligence was provided to “USEUCOM, NATO, Deployed Units and other commands, including operations in Africa and the former Yugoslavia.”\n\n&gt;Buttigieg would eventually return to EUCOM, where he was promoted to team leader, supervising one officer and four intelligence analysts.\n\n&gt;Two years into Buttigieg’s time as mayor, in 2014, he was called for duty again, this time to serve with the US Navy in Afghanistan.\n\n&gt;Contrary to Buttigieg’s portrayal of himself as a gun-toting, freedom-fighting soldier, he enjoyed an immediate high rank during deployment. Just into his first term as mayor, Buttigieg “made sure my chain of command knew that I would rather go sooner than later, and would rather go to Afghanistan than anywhere else,” he wrote in his book.\n\n&gt;Buttigieg was apparently shuttled over quickly, and left soon after.\n\n&gt;He spent his six months in Afghanistan in 2014 with a little-known unit that operated under the watch of the Drug Enforcement Administration. It was the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC), according to his appointment papers. The job description in his discharge papers is blank.\n\n&gt;At the ATFC, Buttigieg “oversaw the analysis and operations conducted from ATFC Kabul HQ.” He also “coordinated intelligence sharing and targeting deconfliction with multiple organizations and represented ATFC at high level briefings.” \n\n&gt;The program was not exactly a smashing success, however. **During the year of Buttigieg’s deployment in Afghanistan, the United Nations found that opium production skyrocketed and that “Afghanistan produces some 90 percent of the world’s illicit opiates.”**\n\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2020/02/07/pete-buttigieg-cia-afghanistan/\n\nButtigieg had spoken against internet lockdown in Kashmir post 370 repeal as mayor.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eezd8i/pete_buttigieg_on_twitter_india_is_an_important/'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'q5wksj'<br />Score:53<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q5wksj/cialinked_frmr_democrat_presidential_runner/</li>

Just went to visit one of my aunts (distant) who is terminally ill and is surviving on dialysis. Its been going for about 6-7 years now and as most of you have guessed, all their savings etc are all depleted. They are mostly supported by relatives and uncles pension which isn't enough to cover the monthly medical expenses of 40-50k. Uncle is also suffering from piles related disorder and has trouble walking etc and mostly stays at home.\n\nOverall, their condition is pretty bad. My cousin also cant get a regular job because he has to literally do all the household work+ medical trips 3 times a week etc. He mostly made his income from doing tuition of local kids but its not enough to run a family. He also didn't marry or finish his bachelors due to this reason. Now here is where it gets bad, due to corona lockdowns, most schools closed down and went online. And the local tutors got hit hard, especially those who are fully dependent on it.\n\nMy aunt asked me to convince him to marry, because she wants to see him with a family before she passes (both kidneys failed, so yeah she doesn't have long). I want to help but getting someone like him a regular job is out of question and none of my contacts can help. I recalled seeing couple of threads in here about people needing jobs etc and they got some decent advice etc. So I decided to post the issue here so that I can get some solid info.\n\nTl;dr - Cousin cant get normal job due to parents medical condition. His parents want him to marry since his age is gonna be 30 soon. So, looking for advice on any type of job he can do (it helps if he can do it online or from home.) I think 8-10k salary should be fine for a start (they rent in kolkata because of the medical treatments). If anyone has any info or any advice or any recommendations please post here.

      <li>Title::: 'Fake Educational Consultancies in India giving themselves good reviews.'<br />Body: ' \n\nThis is a throwaway account.\n\nOne of my old friend runs an educational consultancy in Coimbatore and Namakkal(**Success Point Namakkal and Success Point Coimbatore)**. However, everyone knows that it is a big scam place where they pretend to send you to a good university abroad but the actual university is shit. They also give you ineligible visas so that soon your visa will expire(They will tell it is a extendable visa when in reality it is not). So you will be stranded in a foreign country visaless and jobless. However the consultancy gets a good bribe from the university.\n\nNow when I looked up his consultancy online one month back, it was full of 1 star and 2 star reviews. But now when I saw it today it was full of 5 star reviews so much that it became a 4.9 star overall. All the reviews look heavily fabricated and most of it was done in just 10 days. (Nearly 200 reviews of 5 star only). He runs 2 educational consultancies each in different cities. What puzzled me the most was that both the consultancies had the exact same reviews by the exact same people.\n\nIs there any way to report this malpractice on Google?? Any sane person who knows him will know that it is clearly fabricated. Is there any other kind of way to stop this???\n\nNow when I just search for top education consultancies in Namakkal, that name pops up first in Google reviews. What can I do???\n\nThe name is Success Point and it is in both Namakkal and Coimbatore. Check the reviews yourself if you want.'<br />Author: 'throwaway849h'  id: 'q57nab'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q57nab/fake_educational_consultancies_in_india_giving/</li>

His tryst wjth Indology began ten years back when he started blogging about Hindu symbols and signs and decipher the meaning behind those. His articles on Hindu mythology have been covered by major national dailies like The Times of India and Hindustan Times.\n\nCurrently based in Nashua, New Hampshire, he authored the National Bestseller UNNS-The Captivation, which won major awards and recognitions and the highly acclaimed FINDERS, KEEPERS which was based on historic Shaiva sect and symbols and the rivalry and the secret society of Nine Unknown Men.\n\nThe Tenth Riddle is his third work and is a homage to the Supreme Goddess Adishakti. Three people set on course to solve one of the biggest historical secrets of all times as they chase pieces of a daunting ancient mystery, piece by piece.\n\nA prophecy made up of ten riddles, a very powerful secret and the wires of the murder tangling endlessly, with one end lost deep in the enchantments of sacred feminism of Hinduism.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wLR7_qerz9s"<br />Author: 'karamd'  id: 'q3x2ir'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q3x2ir/ama_with_sapan_saxena_author_on_10th_october/</li>

DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. \n\n**THEY WILL USE THIS ARGUMENT FOREVER, DO NOT GIVE THEM THIS HIGHGROUND**!!\n\nRevoking of art.370 and 35a was more to do with providing equal opportunities to everyone despite their caste/gender in the state, it was about integrating Kashmir with mainstream India and rejecting the notion of separatism once and for all. It was about setting up industries and businesses in the state to provide employment and create a business atmosphere. \n\nObviously revoking an amendment of the constitution on paper won’t solve the deep rooted separatist mindset right? ISI, Resistance front and similar radical organizations can easily prop up 3-4 hitmen in the name of their god and these people will surely be ready to kill anyone and anything provided they go to jannat and get 72 hoors. \n\nWe need to change the mindset of these people, revoking the articles only paved the way for these things, it does not and can not put stop to a radical and exclusionist ideology. \n\nI want to hear opinions of people who thought revoking article 370 and 35a would completely put a stop to separatism in Kashmir valley.

      <li>Title::: 'Treating someone with courtesy and basic human respect does not mean you like them'<br />Body: 'I\'m not sure if this is the right sub for this. But I really wanted to convey this somewhere. \n\nI don\'t know who needs to hear this, but some of my college classmates definitely needs to. \n\nLong story short, a guy in my class texted on the group "Everyone has to like you. Because if they don\'t, you\'ll kill them." \n\nI understand the reason, because I\'m quiet and anti-social and like wearing black, and barely talk to anyone in the class. Classic "weird quiet kid with a gun" trope. I don\'t do that intentionally to look cool, but it is what it is. \n\nBut, if someone needs my help irrespective of if they\'re my friends or not, I do my best to help them. Initially, it was for validation, but soon I realised that I actually like helping others. My classmates usually treat me decently for that, yet I still notice a weird, hesitant look in their eyes. \n\nInitially, I wanted everyone to like me and seeked validation. But slowly, I noticed that\'s not possible, and they\'ll always resent me inside. So this guy openly claiming that nobody likes me just proved my gut feeling right. They never initiated a conversation as a group, yet they gaslight me for it, asking "why are you so quiet and weird?" \n\nDeep down, even I don\'t like them. Most of them are self entitled, rich brats with nothing special about them except their daddies monies. The girls are just shallow creatures with personalities borrowed from either Rachael, Monica or Phoebe from FRIENDS. \n\nBut that doesn\'t mean I hate them to an extent that I\'ll be willing to kill them. Heck, I don\'t even care if they like me or not (Initially, I used to, but not since a year or two). According to me, they\'re free to hate  and resent me as much as they like. But that doesn\'t me they\'ll have the liberty to ignore me or treat me like shit. \n\nPlus I know they won\'t, because some of them are dependent on me, because I\'m in a good position. Not to brag, but I\'m far more smarter, resourceful and reliable than most of them. If they openly hate me, I know I can just cut off myself completely from them, because I barely like to rely on them. \n\nTo conclude, I have no problems with liking them, or even being friends with them. But I won\'t tolerate if someone treats me shit just because they don\'t agree with my lifestyle.'<br />Author: 'Vayunaut'  id: 'q30knq'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q30knq/treating_someone_with_courtesy_and_basic_human/</li>

Neti Kautilyah! ("No, says Kautilya")—**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The Barhaspatyas \\[1\\] say that there are only two sciences: the science of business and the science of government, and the triple Vedas are merely an abridgment for a man experienced in wordly affairs.*\n\n*But Kautilya holds that these four and only these four are the sciences \\[natural and logical science, the triple Vedas, the science of business, the science of government\\]; wherefore it is from these sciences that all that concerns righteousness and wealth is learnt, therefore they are so called.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.2:4-9\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhile the precise procedure was waived in cases of large monetary donations or for applicants from families with significant political sway, the traditional method of admitting students to the university was through an interview. As Brahmin initiates were most typically around the age of eight years, a formal assessment of a child’s knowledge of the Vedas, of the sciences and of the positions held on the same by various scholars and schools was impractical. While your average *gurukula* \\[2\\] might merely require precise pronunciation and a conversational knowledge of Sanskrit, a prestigious and selective university like Taxila looked for some kind of *spark*, a demonstration of insight and the capacity to think about the sciences in the correct way.\n\nIn Chanakya, however, they had found something far greater than a spark: they’d found a fire that could engulf a forest.\n\nAt any problem posed, Chanakya would, rather than immediately stating a solution, ask further questions to understand and dissect the problem, then dissect the proposed solutions to determine the precise unstated costs of these solutions, and question whether the stated dichotomy between the two solutions was even real or not. He hadn’t, at that point, been aware of the existence of the various schools or their implications for the posed problems; however, he had demonstrated a much more generalizable ability to *think*.\n\nTo the seven-year-old boy himself, who had studied the Vedas but had never seen libraries of such size, merely hearing the names of these great men and their scholarly lineages opened a whole new world to him, an experience that could only be akin to that of a conqueror crossing a mighty river that he thought marked the end of the world, doubling overnight the size of the realm of his knowledge.\n\nUpon arriving at Taxila, Chanakya visited the lectures of every school of philosophy that he found the time for, and scoured over their cotton-paper manuscripts in the enormous library of Taxila.\n\nChanakya developed no affinity for the philosophy of the Ajivikas \\[3\\]. While he could appreciate their deterministic principles, he did not quite see how it implied that one ought to roam naked in forests. Indeed, if the Ajivikas believed that the non-existence of free will implied the non-existence of morality, they ought to all be behaving in diverse and eccentric ways, for no one of those behaviours would be superior to another. Instead, they seemed to all conform to the very identical principle of having no ambition and of making no realistic contribution to their own lives or to the lives of others. From this Chanakya inferred that the philosophy was primarily a tool of the lazy and incompetent to excuse their own failings, and to flee the game of life.\n\nThe philosophies of *Nyaya-Vaisheshika* \\[4\\] seemed evidently true to Chanakya; yet they addressed the physical sciences, a subject that wasn’t directly of interest to him.\n\nThe further he studied, Chanakya found himself inclined towards the aspects of philosophy concerned with human goals, and the behavior undertaken to achieve these goals. Philosophies that rejected the appropriateness of human ambitions and desires, whether in the name of eliminating suffering or for any other motive, thus seemed to him as fundamentally amoral and apathetic towards the condition of life.\n\nThe school that Chanakya was most impressed by in matters of philosophical importance was the school of Brihaspati. These Barhaspatyas rejected all metaphysics, stating that all knowledge was based in the senses; furthermore, they held that it was the non-rejection of metaphysics that lead to all irrationality and to standards of *dharma* (righteousness, morality) that had nothing to do with human desires but instead the desires of metaphysical abstractions that lacked a basis in the senses.\n\nThis too, however, was unsatisfactory for Chanakya’s purposes, as he could not accept the complete dismissal of dharma as a valid human goal; nor the logical implication thereof that it was righteous for a king to act solely in the interest of his imperial expansion without regard for the well-being of the people.\n\nChanakya sought, therefore, to reconcile the Barhaspatya rejection of the metaphysical with his own intuitive conception of dharma. To do so, he spoke to many philosophers at the university, playing the advocate of amorality to the dharmics and the advocate of dharma to the Barhaspatyas. The only effect those conversations had, however, was to further cement his confidence, both in the Barhaspatya philosophy and in the Vedic dharma; they did not help him make any progress towards reconciliation.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*… my teacher says, “Whoever desires the progress of the world shall ever hold the sceptre raised. Never can there be a better instrument than the sceptre to bring people under control.”*\n\n*“No,” says Kautilya, “for whoever imposes severe punishment becomes repulsive to the people; while he who awards mild punishment becomes contemptible. But whoever imposes punishment as deserved becomes respectable.”*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.4:6-10\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“Vishnugupta,” said the political science professor Chanaka, choosing to address his most favoured student by the name given to him by his family rather than by the epithet that his peers now addressed him with, “How might a ruler enforce some desired behaviour among the people of his kingdom?”\n\n“People will always act in accordance with their own goals, not the king’s,” said Chanakya, “Thus in order to make someone do what you wish them to, you must make them believe that it is in their interests to do what you wish them to.”\n\nThe first spark.\n\n“Eloquently put,” said Professor Chanaka, “Indeed, this is the basis for punishment and for the science of law itself. For whatever a king might believe will bring progress to the people of the world, punishment is the sole tool on which his power rests, the sole tool by which he may achieve his goals.”\n\n“Not so,” said Chanakya, “The fundamental principle is that you must make them believe that the desired behaviour is in their interests. There are four ways to achieve this. First, they may have an incorrect belief that leads them to reject the action you desire them to make, or their own goals may be unknown to them, or be malleable to eloquent speech. In this case, you may dispel them of these incorrect beliefs and persuade them to act as you desire. Or there may truly be a cost that they incur by acting in the manner that you desire of them – in that case, you may either compensate them for this cost, i.e. purchase their consent, or you may impose an equal cost for non-compliance, i.e. punish their non-consent, which is the approach that you exalt. The fourth and final approach is to falsely convince them that acting in the manner you desire will be of personal benefit to them; while this appears similar to the first approach, the two methods are as far as can be, as convincing someone of the truth is a completely different art from convincing someone of a falsehood. All four of these – *sama*, *dama*, *danda*, *bheda* (respectively: persuasion, purchase, punishment, deceit) – as well as any combination of them, are methods that will grant you control over another person.”\n\n“Perhaps these methods exist in theory,” admitted Professor Chanaka, “But they can hardly be implemented effectively. A king cannot convince a murderer to not murder, pay him to not murder, or deceive him into believing that murdering will cause him to receive divine retribution.”\n\nThe second spark.\n\n“Certainly not all these methods are effective for every situation,” Chanakya conceded, “But you have chosen only one example, that of criminal deterrence, and indeed for this purpose *danda* is the most effective method. But *dama* is used widely outside of government, in trade, agriculture and production. We are employing *sama* right now, in attempting to convincing each other of what we each believe to be the truth.”\n\nProfessor Chanaka nodded, awed by the coherence of his student’s thoughts. “I must concede the truth of your words, Vishnugupta. I would say, then, that what you call *sama* is the method of the Brahmins, *dama* the method of the Vaishyas and *danda* the method of the Kshatriyas to achieve similar goals.”\n\n“Not so,” said Chanakya, “While that characterization is elegant in its simplicity, I believe that all four of these methods are of wider applicability than you suggest. In particular, I believe the kshatriya benefits from the adoption of all four methods. While war is often to be based on *danda*, the effective and lossless execution of a war must rely largely on *bheda*, as a war whose outcome’s truth is known in advance to both sides should never be fought. The employment of armies is primarily based on *dama*; indeed, the use of *danda* for this purpose is known as military conscription, and is a practice of barbarians.”\n\n“I must agree to this too,” said Professor Chanaka, “And in governance?”\n\n“In governance too, a king who uses *danda* only to enforce his laws ends up inflicting punishment on the innocent and quickly becomes reviled among the people. A king who is brutal in his collection of taxes will quickly become hated among the wealthy, or may become reviled for some unintended or perceived partiality in tax collection, and men of influence will then conspire to overthrow and replace him for their own gain. Effective governance requires a combination of all four methods.”\n\nThe third spark.\n\n*That was it.*\n\n*That was the realization.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*But when the law of punishment is kept in abeyance, it gives rise to such disorder as is implied in the proverb of fishes; for in the absence of a magistrate, the strong will swallow the weak; but under his protection, the weak resist the strong.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.4:13-15\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Politics* – politics (and its generalization that Chanakya would soon come to discover, the science of economics) was the basis of the reconciliation of the Barhaspatya with the Vedic dharma. *Dharma*, Chanakya realized, did not require the existence of metaphysics – it emerged naturally, through politics, as a consequence of men pursuing their own personal goals, as unrighteous conduct would not be conducive to one’s *Artha* (wealth) under a functional political system. It was politics, and not any metaphysics, that gave meaning to dharma.\n\nChanakya identified that the fallacy of those Barhaspatya scholars who had thrown out *Dharma* entirely was to define *Artha* too narrowly, as referring only to land, possessions, cattle, gold and currency.\n\nIn fact it made more sense to define *Artha* as having to do with *all human goals entirely*, or as Chanakya would later call them: the *Purushartha* \\[5\\]. In the fullest generality, there were three goals – the *trivarga* – for a man to rightfully pursue:\n\n(\\*) *artha* (wealth) in the traditional sense,\n\n(\\*) *kama* (pleasure), which the Barhaspatyas had accepted as a valid human goal, and\n\n(\\*) *dharma* (righteousness)\n\nThe Purushartha as formulated by Kautilya would go on to take its place as the most fundamental idea in Hindu ethics and ethical philosophy; with later schools adding a fourth goal, *moksha* to the list but disagreeing on the precise meaning of this fourth goal.\n\nBut to Kautilya, *Artha* was fundamental, encompassing not only physical assets in the traditional sense, but all goals, all ends that a man may desire. *Artha* was the root, the cause of Dharma; and much as matter was comprised of *dravya* (substance), as consciousness was comprised of *atman* (self/soul), *artha* was the basic element that comprised all human interaction, its cause, its modes and its goals.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*So says Kautilya, that artha and artha alone is important, in as much as dharma and kama depend upon artha for their realisation.*\n\n—Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, 1.7:6-7\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *Barhaspatya* – aka *Carvaka*, *Lokayata*; the school of Brihaspati; a rationalist school that rejected metaphysics held *artha* (wealth) and *kama* (pleasure) as the ultimate goals of morality. In Kautilya’s time this school was considered a part of Vedic/Hindu philosophy.\n\n\\[2\\] *gurukula* – “school”, or more precisely analogous to research groups in postgraduate academia; the ancient Indian university system grew out of the assimilation of multiple prestigious gurukulas collaborating, competing and debating on shared infrastructure\n\n\\[3\\] *Ajivika* – determinism/no-free-will\n\n\\[4\\] *Nyaya-Vaisheshika* – physicalism and reductionism/atomism, a Vedic (Hindu) school\n\n\\[5\\] *Purushartha* – human goals/wealth; *trivarga* – three realms\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations.

      <li>Title::: 'The success of SUMOLI, a neutral Indian pidgin language!'<br />Body: "A month ago, a few friends realized a crazy idea of evolving a pidgin of all Indian langauges through a discord server and in the process, give birth to a neutral Indian language that averages out Sanskrit and Tamil rooted languages. Thus came Sumoli, where 'Su' came from the Sanskrit word for good/easy/convenient and 'Moli' came from the Tamil word for Language. Our approach was to let people talk and use images, gifs and emojis to create associations and loan words. We listed a few basic words people can use to start asking around and through pure immersion, learn the language. We noticed a lot of redundant, inactive users in the server and pruned them out. All that was left were interested, dedicated and active members. Within ten days, we evolved a vocabulary of 200 words and a grammar that included conjugations and tenses. A few weeks ago, we decided to document it and as new grammar rules and vocabulary are discovered, update the documentation. The documentation process is now almost finished and we are proud of what Sumoli has become.\n\nOf course, our user numbers aren't still that great and we can only wonder of how huge this can became with a huger base. We would appreciate more dedicated members, interested in languages. The server is not limited to Indians. In fact, many of our non-Indian members who took the time to research and loan words from Indian langauges are what made Sumoli happen. This is still an early phase, and we thank the communities who helped us get here.

(GS is where I need to work and I did work on it, but the improvement was just not good enough to make the difference). Also, due to inadequate prep I think, I got rejected from RBI Grade B.\n\n\nI have an exam in few days and I am prepared for it, but after 3 years of the same schedule, I\'m burned out and looking to work, life has been pretty much on hold and would like to start experiencing it. Social life and travel are pretty much dead, and with friends going back to their cities it\'s difficult to just study and nothing else.\n\nThe cousin in line before me is getting married and there is subtle pressure from family to get work.\n\nWhat job should be something that I can get if let\'s say I can commit 5 effective hours every day for the next 3-4 months to learn a new skill? (5 hours because I want to spend a few hours daily with revision work, is it too little to commit?) An introvert, marketing, is it my type? should I stay away from it?\n\nBank jobs are not an option given my dad worked in one and that will not sit well with him.\n\nEducation and Experience: Graduated as a Computer Science student from a Tier 2 college(lesser known of the IIITs) in 2018 with a 7.5 CGPA and a couple of internships and experience of hosting a TEDx event and running a coding club.

The same is for dating life, used to date till last year and now given my date of the exam, focused on it. \n\n I\'m grateful enough for basic things my parents have provided, but it\'s odd to ask them big bucks every week or so.

UN claims to be pro-democracy, pro-Human Rights, yet has members who are the biggest violators of Human Rights and often totally undemocratic (like Saudi, Russia, China). So I wondered, why does India have to pamper the world? Why does it have to keep relations with the West who thinks we are some 'street-sh!tting' primitive country, especially with Britain who oppressed us for a century and many of whom openly support and love Churchill? Why do we have to keep relations with Arab countries who think of us as kafirs? Why do we have to have a say in Afghanistan conflict, Israel-Palestine conflict, etc.? The reason, I kind of found on the internet, is money, trade and oil/gas. Saudi, Iran supplies oil (or gas, I forgot lol). Israel gives us military equipment, US and other western countries is responsible for FDI, China gives us...everything from toys to phones, etc.\n\nBut I thought to myself - can't India be self-reliant and free from all these chains? Can't India have its own oil (or research in other energy sources?)? Can't India make its own toys, phones, etc? Can't India create its own internet, its own military equipments, etc? Can't India develop without FDI and MNCs? I mean, our country is so big and we have 1.3 billion people with lots of diversity.

Throughout I had thoughts of giving back to the nation in some way and had decided to pursue my career here. Perhaps, something for the betterment of rural economy or on similar lines. However, past couple of years have been giving me second thoughts. I am sure I'd get better opportunities abroad and obviously better standard of living. The only thing stopping me is my obsession with staying connected to my roots. The thought of losing my identity abroad makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThen again, I just finished reading 'India: A wounded civilization' by V.S.Naipaul. Even though he's a bit harsher than necessary sometimes, he hits the right chords. Our nation has been decaying for sometime now. I don't want to sound pessimistic but all we do is promote mediocrity. \nTaking the present government for example, last two years, right from the anti CAA protests to now anti farm law protests, hooligans are creating nuisance around the capital in the name of secularism and farmers. Our overhyped prime minister and home minister have looked like lame ducks. No matter how many people die, no matter how much the public is inconvenienced. All they seem to care for is their 'image' and of course winning the next elections. While we still wait for that 'masterstroke' of a 4d chess. \n\nAt times I feel we are still ruled by a cross between aurangazeb and the British. The incompetent bureaucrats now deciding heights of ganesha idols. I mean what??  People being arrested in front of their children for burning crackers. While these nincompoops celebrate their election victories as and how it pleases them. I feel angry and helpless looking at 20 something b.tech/ m.tech students wasting their time mugging up books to prepare for civil services. Yes, they'll decide how to harass citizens even more. The notion of 'secured job', 'govt. Job' has ruined this country. Not trying to create a divide but I've observed this more in the northern part of India. \n\nDo you have hopes for this country?

I\'ve nearly forgotten most of the languages, may be except Scheme which we learnt back in the university (SCIP was the course book). \n\nNow, I am not sure if libraries will be available for scheme for doing web dev. And when I recollect Java, the thought itself is a torture and I really will start crying if I have to write Java.\n\nSo, I need to write small web app which will mostly be serving static content. But I need an editor which will author the content that will generate such static content. Its a domain specific language (for which I can provide BNF grammar) and I\'d like to see the generated content live. Something like a Markdown live viewer, but may be the DSL is bit more complicated than simple Markdown.\n\nI have a budget of 2-3 days for this project. Help me pick up a stack that\'s simple, nimble and can expand if need be i.e. should look good and scale if I launch it for public. The way I think, this will be public information and not a commercial service. There **may** be some derivative products out of this that might have commercial potential.\n\nWhen I look around, 90% of the tutorials start with React this, ember that, Angular dash, webpack noise, saas,jaas, ... what the fuck is all this man. \n\nI am okay with any language. But it seems people are developing server apps with JavaScript as well these days. As a language, I am not averse to it but I don\'t see appropriateness of event-driven browser model on server. I am willing to be pursuaded if the effort can be bought down. And I forgot CSS so any "easy" CSS framework that will make the site okay to look at (just not ugly), I\'d be happy.\n\nThis will be a very simple static [site](https://i.imgur.com/rQc4hJS.jpg) in which\n\n1. #1 is the main navigation\n2. #2 is sub menu that is context dependent on #1 (static, predefined)\n3. #3 is the actual content, graphics heavy, mostly javascript rendering on canvas.\n4. #4 is a collapsible menu that is context dependent on the content of #3 (static, pre defined).\n5. The content should be viewable even on very old browsers (~ 2010 ) \n\nThe real work is the editor though. There will be lot of JavaScript so I will need to divide them into modules. There could be few modules which I would like to load them on demand. I haven\'t done any work using node environment earlier. But I understand how it works architecturally. I need help getting build environment so that I can use libraries such as Babel to convert modern JavaScript into something that can target older browsers. Same goes for CSS too.\n\nCan you help me pick right tools for this work.

The fighter jets included nuclear-capable bombers as well. The incursion led to Taiwan launching patrols with its own aircraft as well as activating missile defense systems in anticipation of an invasion, although things did not escalate that far - yet. China\'s Communist government has not commented on the latest incursions, but officially, the country views Taiwan as part of its own territory and therefore these flights as domestic issues. \n\n2. [UK faces fuel shortage due to lack of truck drivers](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58781445)\n\nIn a glaring example of the consequences of Brexit, the UK faced a fuel shortage over the past week, with over a quarter of petrol pumps in England going dry and panic buying in the streets. The shortage, according to an industry body, is because of a shortage of truck drivers to transport the fuel from ports to pumps. Previously, a large proportion of these drivers would be immigrants from the poorer parts of the EU, but Brexit ended that. PM Boris Johnson\'s government acknowledged the crisis and called in the military to transport fuel, while announcing 5,000 temporary work visas for drivers. He also called on the industry to raise wages instead of relying on poorly-paid foreign workers. \n\n3. Elections update (thanks to u/itisverynice for suggesting this)\n\nSeveral democracies around the world recently had a round of elections. In Canada, PM Justin Trudeau called for an early election in the hopes of securing a majority (he was leading a minority govt). He was betting on his supposedly successful handling of COVID-19, but that backfired on him, and [he is back to leading a new minority govt](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/20/americas/canada-election-results-trudeau-o-toole-intl/index.html), having wasted C$600 mn on an unnecessary election, according to the opposition. In Germany, Angela Merkel\'s 16 year reign as Chancellor (equivalent of PM) ended with a [narrow defeat for her Christian right wing CDU-CSU coalition](https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-angela-merkel-14ddbbb09c8c9ea194155a73de0970e2), with rival Social Democrats (SDP) winning more seats. However, under Germany\'s complex election system, it can take months for a new govt to be formed, and Merkel will continue in a caretaker position till then. Meanwhile, France is about to enter election mode for its 2022 Presidential Elections, which is primarily becoming a competition between incumbent Macron and his right-wing rival Marie La Pen, but with right-wing TV personality Eric Zemmour [also looking to enter the fray](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/13/far-right-journalist-quits-french-tv-show-amid-election-rumours). Interestingly, all three hold rather unfavourable views against political Islam. And finally, in Japan, the revolving door of short-term PMs continues, with the ruling party booting out PM Suga [in favour of Fumio Kishida](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/29/1041456075/japan-fumio-kishida-ldp-prime-minister) in a leadership vote, just one step short of being formally sworn in as PM. He is known as a quiet technocrat who will focus on lifting Japan\'s economy from the abyss of the pandemic, but is also socially conservative (he opposes same-sex marriage) and weary of China.\n\n4. [Egypt flies first "official" flight into Israel](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/egyptair-plane-lands-in-israel-for-first-time-ever-680905)\n\nEgypt\'s national carrier, Egyptair, flew its first ever flight into Tel Aviv in Israel, the internationally-recognized capital of the country, further underlining the historic changes happening in the region. While the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, Egyptair only operated a special subsidiary, Sinai Air, between the two countries, with the aircrafts being devoid of any logos and markings to indicate its origins - a quiet affair, if you may. In contrast, this Egyptair flight had all the logos and received a water canon welcome in Tel Aviv, with four regular flights per week between Tel Aviv and Cairo being announced publicly. This follows direct flights to Israel from Morocco, Bahrain, and the UAE as part of the Abraham Accords. This is the first major diplomatic victory for the new PM Naftali Bennett. \n\n5. [Rare cyclone Shaheen batters Oman](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/03/1042830624/oman-cyclone-shaheen-tropical-storm-damages)\n\nA rare cyclone named Shaheen is battering the coast of Oman, in a further sign that the world\'s climate is changing. In India, it is fairly well known that the Bay of Bengal is prone to cyclones, such as the Supercyclone of 1999 that killed 10,000 people in Odisha, but the Arabian Sea is usually calmer with far fewer cyclones. It is believed that this is due to the smaller size of the Bay of Bengal and the huge volume of water that comes into it from the Ganga and Brahmaputra, both of which make its waters warm and conducive to cyclones. In contrast, the Arabian Sea has only one large warm-water body flowing into it - the Indus river - and so most cyclones are concentrated in the Konkan-Saurashtra-Sindh region. Shaheen, in the Western Arabian Sea, is therefore a rare phenomemon. Already, workers in some poorly-made housing complexes died due to the collapse of the building from strong winds, even before the cyclone itself made landfall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The 1914 Shimla Convention\n\nDiplomacy is a delicate game: behind all the smiles and ceremony lies a delicate balance, where what is unsaid is just as important as what is said, and one misstep can lead to unintended consequences. India and China, as ancient civilizations, were quite adept at diplomacy, but the British occupation of India broke that chain, even while China survived in some form. The Shimla Convention of 1914, which created the border we in India know as the McMohan line, is an example of a diplomatic engagement that didn\'t go quite as planned but lives on a century later. \n\nBy now, we have all heard of The Great Game - the rivalry between the Russian Empire and the British Empire in India over the territories in between them i.e., Afghanistan, Persia, and Tibet. The Great Game saw bitter political and military moves between the two powers that turned buffer territories into proxy battlefields, but that\'s a story for another day. By 1900 however, a new reality was beginning to dawn: the rise of Germany in Europe, and its steady alignment with the Ottoman Empire that could throw open the buffer regions between British India and Tsarist Russia. Consequently, the Anglo-Russia convention of 1907 was signed in St Petersburg, in which northern Persia became a Russian sphere of influence, and southern Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet of the British. Finally, the Tibet question was open for Britain. \n\nTibet is an interesting place. While the CCP would have us believe that it was always a part of China, nothing could be farther from the truth. Tibet was on and off a vassal state of China for 1,000 years, sometimes paying an annual tribute to the Imperial Court of the Qing Dynasty, and other times asserting its independence. During The Great Game, both Britain and Russia recognized China\'s *suzerainty* over Tibet (meaning, Tibet was a vassal of China), but not its *sovereignty* (i.e., Tibet was not a part of China). Words are important here - so remember this key difference. But with the 1907 Convention, Britain sought to play a bigger role in Tibet. Tibetans too were quite happy to let the British in, hoping to keep the Chinese at bay. Sensing trouble, in 1910, the Qing emperor invaded Tibet and nearly conquered it, but the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 abruptly ended both the Tibet expedition as well as the Qing Dynasty, with the Republic of China being formed after the end of the monarchy. At the same time, declaring victory, the 13th Dalai Lama declared Tibetan independence, although neither British India nor China recognized it at the time.\n\nA shaky new regime in China and an unrecognized government in Tibet - that was too much for the British. In 1913, Viceroy Hardinge, till then busy planning a new capital in Delhi, convened a conference of all three parties in Shimla to discuss the issue. The British were represented by Sir Henry McMohan (pronounced "muck-man," it\'s an Irish name), after whom the modern border is named. A plan was drawn up to divide Tibet into two zones - Inner Tibet (roughly the modern areas adjoining India\'s northeast as well as Bhutan), would be under Chinese suzerainty but the religious control of the Dalai Lama, while Outer Tibet (the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region of today, adjoining Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Nepal) would be under the full control of the Dalai Lama alone. Subsequently, maps were drawn up between the two parts of Tibet and China, as well as with British India (the border of which we call the McMohan Line today, after which the Northeast Frontier Agency became part of British India - Arunachal Pradesh today). The Chinese representative initialed the agreement, but the government of China soon repudiated it and refused to join in the final signing ceremony, declaring that all of Tibet was a part of China. \n\nSo this is where the diplomatic situation stood. China had joined an international conference with a Tibetan representative of equal diplomatic rank, thus implicitly recognizing Tibetan independence (for the same reason, India has refused to hold equal-rank diplomatic exchanges with the Taliban). But soon enough, they backed out of it, perhaps sensing public anger at further "humiliation" of China. Tibet and British India signed the agreement and recognized the McMohan Line. And most importantly at the time, Britain recognized only Inner Tibet as being under Chinese control (but not a part of China - suzerainty vs sovereignty). This situation, complex as it was, lasted till the end of WW2, when it all came crashing down. \n\nBritain, war ravaged and facing multiple mutinies in the British Indian Army inspired by Bose, decided to leave, transferring its treaty obligations with China to the newly-formed Republic of India. China fell to the CCP, creating the People\'s Republic of China. Soon enough, the CCP invaded and annexed Tibet, and ironically the Indian government of Nehru recognized the annexation (even encouraged it, some might argue). Where does that leave the Shimla Convention? As far as China is concerned, they claim that Tibet never had a right to sign anything and thus the McMohan line is invalid - even though they sent an equal representative to Shimla, and their modern *internal border* also has the McMohan line between Inner (Yunnan and Sichuan) and Outer Tibet (Tibet Autonomous Region). If India recognized Tibet as being a part of China, it would repudiate the ability of Tibet to have signed the Convention in the first place as well, and thus made the McMohan line null and void *on the Indian side* too. Nehru, perhaps sensing this folly, nuanced his policy by using the old British line of Tibet being under Chinese suzerainty but not sovereignty, but China was having none of it. Having secured India\'s recognition of the annexation of Tibet, they declared that India was illegally occupying a part of it (Arunachal Pradesh) that the Tibetans had no right to transfer at Shimla. And the rest of course, is history that we live to this day. This is the cost of diplomatic ambiguities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have any questions about the world of geopolitics?

In front of them was a simple decoration of flowers and toys.When the clock struck 12 and their fervor reached its peak, there was a knock on the door.The father, surprised, opened the door and stared at the familiar uniforms of the dreaded troops of the Major Legion for Effective Constitutional Hinduism Affairs.The "Major" was an inside joke in the ministry, just like everything else in the name for the not-so-secret police.The leader of the troops, dressed in a red-and-red military uniform and a green beret, looked like a tumorous chili.His face was covered with a white mask and all one could see were the kohl-heavy eyes as red as the uniform, eyes which were now piercing the hapless father."Huzoor!" pleaded the father, using the right appellation despite the shock.The leader pointed his baton inside and his troops stormed the hall. One of them measured the little Kṛṣṇa using a vernier caliper."A millimeter more than the 20mm we generously allow," he barked.The eyes of the leader got redder. Another pointed to the flowers and the prasād, not even indicating what generous allowance was violated.Yet another used a chromatometer on the clothes worn by the family. "Unapproved colors," he said. "Too orange and not the right green."A signal from the leader and the troops began to dismantle everything. Flowers were trampled upon, prasād was flung into a garbage bag, toys were crushed.The little Kṛṣṇa, a millimeter higher, was thrown into a sack to be carried across the Yamuna without the waters parting.Mayur watched helplessly but his ten-year old patience ran out watching his father\'s kurta being torn because it was a shade more orange than Fanta."Leave him alone, you rākśasas!" he shouted. They threw him down, but at least he distracted them from his mother\'s green saree.In a span of a few minutes the frolic and fervor was replaced by sobs and tears, the decibel and the radius, respectively, of which were next in line by the ministry to regulate.Mayur felt anger rising in him the way Garuḍa rose after obtaining amṛta, but he was no Garuḍa.In the 3 years since Diwali and Holi were completely banned under the then newly constituted Ministry for Hindu Reformation (MoHRe), a series of laws were passed by the government, upheld by courts, and executed by the Major Legion for Effective Constitutional Hinduism Affairs.For every Hindu festival that was still graciously allowed, the authorities blared the restrictions from mosque loudspeakers continually (cannot be continuously for the obvious five reasons).The pūjāgrah of a Hindu home was as much a property of the government as Hindu temples.Instead of the usual Delhi, the HQ of MoHRe was decided to be in Sivakasi, a model, modern city that had shed its regressive ways faster than peapods can be peeled.The mushrooming white buildings were perfect for the Major Legion for Effective Constitutional Hinduism Affairs.In Delhi air pollution had skyrocketed to expand maximum government any further.Since Diwali had been declared the only source of pollution by the then govt., and Diwali had then been banned, a law was promptly passed that the Delhi air be considered pure regardless of the AQI.After eradicating Hindu festivals in public as if they were a virus, the govt. had felt restless like the Dutch sailors after they had hunted the last dodo."If Hindu temples are ours," they ratiocinated, "does it matter if they are inside homes?"So started the persecution."Papa," said Mayur. "When I grow up I want to be strong enough to defeat these rākśasas."His father, lovingly cleaning up the place, redecorating it, and using a small picture of Kṛṣṇa instead (20x15mm), nodded with a smile."Tell me the story of Holi, Papa," said Mayur."In days of yore," said the father, "there lived an Asura king, Hiraṇyakaśipu.""I know that one, Papa," said Mayur. "I want to hear again the story of Holi and how it was celebrated."The father stared at a distance. "It is too late, Mayur," he said. "Let\'s go to sleep." / (Source: https://threader.app/thread/1444353786613436418)'<br />Author: 'StarsAtLadakh'  id: 'q0cukt'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/q0cukt/in_days_of_yore_by_kansaratva/</li>

However look at the prices, I do not understand why on earth would you ask ₹700 - ₹1500 for just a 20 mins session? The problem I want to highlight is the short time, not money. The Counsellor / Psychotherapist does not give enough in-depth time to understand your problem or provide a tailored solution. The counsellor just label us quickly as MDD or OCD without any indepth categorical understanding of the individual and what specific problem the person has.\n\nIf we observe the Western countries, they have a very robust, detail-oriented system with regards to mental health. Sessions are a minimum 1 hour long, and the counsellor is not in a hurry to wrap up, to attend next patient. Counsellors take your case seriously, ask you in-depth questions, let you talk in-depth with details, and the diagnosis is accurate and very categorical.\n\nI understand that studying Psychology must be costly, but charging ₹700 to ₹1500 for just 20-30 mins is just, loot or say, carelessness, without substantial help.

However, were it to meet UN Sustainable Goal Development targets, the peak would be earlier and see a population decline to 929 million.\n\n**REASON FOR SHARP DECLINE**\n\nThe sharper fall, say the group of scientists who are affiliated to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, is due to the assumption that all women globally will have have much higher access to contraception and education.\n\nThis scenario will lead to a sharper reduction in the Total Fertility Rate, a metric that shows on average how many children a women must have to keep replenishing population. A TFR lower than 2.1, it is said, leads to a decline in a country’s population\n\nIndia’s population grew at 1.2 % average annual rate between 2010 and 2019: UN report\n\n“In our model, in a population where all females have 16 years of education and 95% of females have access to contraception, the global TFR was projected to converge to 1·41 (1·35–1·47). The difference between a convergent TFR of 1·75 or 1·41 is profound,” the scientists say in their paper.\n\nhttps://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget2019-20/economicsurvey/doc/vol1chapter/echap07_vol1.pdf"<br />Author: 'Itchy_Shirt_1635'  id: 'pz3bmg'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pz3bmg/indias_demographics_tfr_and_population_peak/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Any advice for a foreign-born Indian moving to India?'<br />Body: "Hello everyone, I just wanted to get some insight. So I am a 25 y/o, Canadian-born, mixed-race Indian dude (half-Indian and half-European) who fantasizes about moving to India. I just am not enjoying my life in Canada very much for a variety of reasons and I want to explore India and try living there. Do you have any advice for me on what to expect? I guess I am basically a foreigner with partial Indian heritage but I am quite knowledgeable on Indian culture, I just do not know any Indian-language fluently (which I think is the most critical thing for me to work on before I make my dream of moving to India come true). How is life in India like? How's the dating scene? What kind of work can I find there? I am a graduate from a Canadian university with a Bachelor of Applied Science. I have been working in my field of study for a couple of years now and I hope my occupational experience can help me land a decent job in India to support myself. I have only visited India once when I was a 3-year-old child back in 1999 so I essentially have no prior experience to draw on. Let me know if my dream is realistic or not - I feel depressed not being in India and feel like I'm missing out on my purpose of life."<br />Author: 'NorthSentinelese1996'  id: 'pywd2h'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pywd2h/any_advice_for_a_foreignborn_indian_moving_to/</li>

I got banned for 7 days cause of that. Meanwhile, this post gets upvoted https://np.reddit.com/r/chutyapa/comments/pxcod4/sweet_justice_no_need_to_further_divide_islam/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf and nothing happens.\n\nThe entire sub is like that. Reddit should be viewed as a product of an enemy and should be abandoned. The alternative can have a feature where subs that discriminate to the public based on a diverse range of opinions, are automatically set to private. Regardless of whatever woke-status obsessed weirdos run reddit, the new platform will be safe.'<br />Author: 'throwaway941285'  id: 'pym19k'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/pym19k/india_should_get_rid_of_all_anti_freespeech_laws/</li>
