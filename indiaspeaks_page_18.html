      <li>Title::: 'India Megapost 3.0 - Economic Indicators, Development, and more!'<br />Body: 'This post is pretty long so I will be dividing in different sections:\n\n1. Companies investing into India 2020/21\n2. India Development &amp; Economic Indicators Trend\n3. Infrastructure Projects\n4. Discussion of "Brain Drain"\n5. Discussion of "overpopulation"\n6. My views and experiences\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Disclaimer &amp; Why write this?**\n\nJust  want to say that I am NOT any of the youtubers that I mention. They make great videos and every  Indian should watch them. Why did I write all this? Well I do this for my own benefit and interest. I have high interest in development and infrastructure and science.\n\nWhy write about India? I am personally proud to be Indian. My attitude changed of India when it was much worse and dirtier (I was like 5-9 years old). I am impressed with the development that happened so far. More should be done but nearly everything I want for the country is already having steps being done to complete.\n\nI hope you actually read this fully rather than skimming. Hope you enjoy and any feedback is welcome as well as other facts worthy of discussion.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# India companies investing into India: dataset and dashboard\n\nSo I made a data visualisation dashboard so that people can interact with it and explore it. I made the  dataset based on the news articles I  have seen and recorded them and  filled in the dataset where necessary. This includes company name, company country, investment state, category  and the amount.\n\nThe dataset requires further exploring, such as you can explore "state investments"  category as it contains investments that are not mentioned in other articles. These includes how much a state has attracted in  investments. Such as [Uttar Pradesh attracting 1.88 trillion rupees in the last 3.5 years](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/uttar-pradesh-gets-over-rs-1-88-trillion-investment-over-last-3-5-years-121013001286_1.html).\n\nFeel free to notify me of any investments you might find. I will add it if appropriate. Special thanks to [u/itisverynice](https://www.reddit.com/u/itisverynice/) for notifying me of investments.\n\nNote: A lot of the news articles don\'t list how much a company is investing in the dataset. If you want, you can check the source and notify me if you know how much that company is investing. The source to the dataset is added in the dataset.\n\nLink to the dashboard: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/plebman1125/viz/IndianInvestmentsDashboard\\_16220829360130/Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/plebman1125/viz/IndianInvestmentsDashboard_16220829360130/Dashboard)\n\nI also wanna add that India has [50,000 startups registered, India aims for as many more by 2024](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/with-50000-startups-registered-india-aims-for-as-many-more-by-2024/articleshow/71440117.cms) and that [under Modi’s pet scheme, startup jobs jump 126%](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/sme/startup-india-under-modis-pet-scheme-startup-jobs-jump-126-this-many-companies-recognised/2087584/).\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# India Development &amp; Economic Indicators Trend\n\n**India Development Indicators Trend**\n\n* Life Expectancy: [India went from a life expectancy of 35.21 in 1950 to 69.73 in 2020](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/IND/india/life-expectancy)\n* Literacy Rate: [Literacy rate was 12% in 1947 and then it became 74.04% in 2011](https://www.census2011.co.in/literacy.php)\n   * According to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_India), of which there is a table of the literacy since 1881.\n      * The male literacy rate went from 27.16% to 82.14% from 1951 to 2011\n      * The female literacy rate went from 8.86% to 65.46% from 1951 to 2011\n      * Male literacy rate improved by **54.98** and female literacy rate improved by **56.6**\n* Poverty: \n   * [India has lifted 271 million people out of poverty from 2005/06 - 2015/16](https://www.in.undp.org/content/india/en/home/sustainable-development/successstories/MultiDimesnionalPovertyIndex.html). \n   * For extreme poverty, [it is estimated that now only 88 million Indians are in extreme poverty](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8-gdp-growth-helped-reduce-poverty-un-report/article6862101.ece).

For those that don\'t know for some reason,  "**overpopulation** or overabundance occurs when a species\' population becomes so excessive that people deem it must be managed." Essentially too many people being more worse.\n\nMany people also think that the goal of Thanos is correct. Its severely not. For those that don\'t know, Thanos is a Marvel villain whose goal is to wipe out half of all living things because of overpopulation. Its severely false. Say this actually happened, yes then it would mean that half of criminals, murderers, terrorists and whatnot would be gone, BUT that would also mean that half of engineers, half of doctors, supply chain drivers, farmers would be gone. Humanity is at its current peak in development.\n\nSo only two countries in the world have a population greater than &gt;400 million people. China and India. This would be due to the ancient history of the countries, both having an estimated 10,000 years of history as well as both countries have some of the best farmland in the world.\n\nNow people keep thinking population will constantly increase and never end. But however, theres a thing where a generation dies out. So for example, our grandparents generation, there are a large amount of them as infant mortality was high at that time. Now it has halved and people are having less kids. Only 1-2 mostly. As living standards improve, female access to education and contraception. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348) discusses more about the concept. India is in the industrialization stage. \n\nNow you might say "population density". Yes India is a dense country. But according to these [ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density), India is ranked 19th in the world. This does not include territories. Now you might say "yup india is overpopulated and is doomed." Well countries like South Korea, Israel, Netherlands, Taiwan, Singapore and Monaco are high-income nations and are way more dense than India. \n\nThere is another measure for population density. It is [by real population density based on food growing capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_real_population_density_based_on_food_growing_capacity). This takes into account arable land. India is ranked 88th in the world. Not including territories. Again, there are more developed countries which are way more dense. By this logic shouldn\'t Singapore (1st rank) and UAE (6th rank) be some of the worst places to live? Well yet they are two of the richest countries in the world and are massive trading hubs in the world. \n\nAlso, according to India\'s economic indicators, stuff like food production and material production has improved a large amount. \n\nOh and how about India being in a much better state than during the British times, of which life expectancy was around 28 AND the poverty was severely rampant and much worse.\n\nAlso, in regard to India overtaking China:\n\n* In 2015, it was predicted that india would overtake china in population by 2022:\xa0[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33720723](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33720723)\n* In 2017, it was predicted that india would overtake china in population by 2024:\xa0[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-population-to-surpass-that-of-chinas-around-2024-un/articleshow/59257045.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-population-to-surpass-that-of-chinas-around-2024-un/articleshow/59257045.cms)\n* In 2019, it was predicted that india would overtake china in population by 2027:\xa0[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/indi](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/19/health/indi)\n\nAccording to this\xa0[link](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53409521), India\'s population is expected to drop to 732 million by 2100. This is because the young population will have much less kids due to the increase in education and decrease in infant mortality rate. Our grandparents generation, the baby boomers. Their generation had their parents making more kids due to the infant mortality rate and less  education. But now our generation (assuming you\'re millenial/gen Z) will  have less kids as theres more access to this stuff.\xa0\n\nIndia is not doomed to "overpopulation"\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Discussion of "Brain Drain"\n\nIndia has [about 32 million NRIs and PIOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin). There are those that emigrate or were born in these countries due to  British moving Indian labourers to work during the shitty colonial times. Such as Fiji.\n\nNow from my observations, not everyone who leaves India is necessarily a brain drain. According to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin), the most are in the U.S. this MIGHT be a brain drain but majority just do simple white collar jobs in America. Then you can see next on the list are UAE, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, which are also considered developing countries. If you consider where the diaspora is, majority are in developing countries. Many of those who go to Arab countries for labour work. Im sure Indians know about the labour camps they have there. These people remit money back to India. [India has the largest remittance in the world with $69 billion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance). Hell, in my experience, majority of the Indians who come here to Australia just do stuff like nursing jobs or whatever because it pays so damn much for so little work. Nursing meaning aged care, not in hospitals.\n\nAlso, it can kind of benefit India in a way of these people leaving. For example, spreading cuisines, people taking interest in Bollywood,  Diwali, Holi and more. Except those that are those NRIs who think  they\'re superior and loathing. The NRIs I know of like India but are just here to have a simpler lifestyle and to remit money back. The self-loathers are the bad people however, I know a few but they\'re irrelevant. My parents plan to move back to India and my parents left cause my dad isn\'t fond of his parents and was getting paid a low salary.\n\nMore points against Brain Drain:\n\n* [India ranked 9th in TOTAL scientific papers](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php)\n   * Ranked 13th in 1996\n   * Ranked 11th in 2006\n   * Ranked 5th in 2019\n   * Ranked 4th in 2020\n* [With 50,000 startups registered, India aims for as many more by 2024](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/with-50000-startups-registered-india-aims-for-as-many-more-by-2024/articleshow/71440117.cms)\n* [Labour force is about 500 million people.

Again, barely scraped the surface when it comes to science. Then we have many companies investing into India,  providing jobs and benefiting the country as well.\n\nAlso, I know that the number of NRIs and PIOs are 32 million. India labour force is 500 million. So that means 6.4% of the labour force left India.  According to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k2kskg/indians_top_the_list_of_educated_migrants_in_rich/), there are 3.12 million highly educated migrants. So thats 0.624% of India\'s labour force.\n\nAnd again **If India is improving, does brain drain heavily impact the country? Isn\'t it still improving?**\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# My Views and Experiences\n\nBelow  is some of my opinions. I just wanna say I am technically an NRI and I was raised in America, living in Australia. Though I consider myself [ABCD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/iu8m3q/indians_born_in_india_vs_abcds/). The meme \n\n**My personal experience in seeing manufacturing**: I live in Australia. In Sydney the metro trains that were made were made in Chennai. Here is a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cnt9he/a_while_ago_i_saw_a_post_about_how_india_made_the/) for that of which I posted. Very nice trains. When I went to India, I got a OnePlus phone (gonna say that this was before the boycotting, im not getting rid of my phone that i paid for) that was assembled in India. Then here in Australia, theres heaps of medicines that are made in India. I buy my clothes in India and they were all made there except for a small amount of shirts.\n\n**What needs to be done**: Need to build roads, roads and more roads. Roads that are paved that too. Roads are the underlying foundation of a country. This needs more  work. But I also wanna add that the [NHAI has the world record of creating 30 km road in a day](https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/roadways/nhai-creates-record-in-a-first-road-construction-touches-30-km-per-day-details-here/2188631/). This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPjYq9tuHds) shows some examples of road related projects Then ports are also highly needed, in regard to this [Narendra Modi says that $82 billion will be invested on ports by 2035](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-says-82-billion-being-invested-in-ports/article33970040.ece). This includes investment in waterways as well.\n\nI will say however airports are now heaps good in India. I remember Mumbai airport being utterly trash before the new  terminal came. This is both domestic and international. I also went to Delhi airport and saw how massive and nice it was. Even the outside area was impressive. Hell, [Indian airports have won several awards for being some of the world\'s best airports](https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/airlines-aviation/proud-achievement-delhi-mumbai-bengaluru-6-other-indian-airports-bag-awards-for-worlds-best-airports/1894472/).\n\n**THE COUNTRY IS NOT DOOMED.** To the doomers, [OK DOOMER](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1411973-doomer)\n\nHope you enjoyed this post. Please feel free to comment more links of  investment that I might have missed. I posted this due to my desire to share information.

      <li>Title::: 'Why does it appear that rampant casteism is practiced by Jatts? What can we do to solve this?'<br />Body: 'Title is the TLDR, apologies if this post sounds distasteful towards Jatts, I don\'t mean it this way as I try to eliminate casteism from my peers and mine\'s minds too, I am open to being educated on Jatts as well.\n\nI notice that a lot rampant caste slurs are used by Jatts to talk shit about almost anyone that isn\'t them, specifically Sikh Jatts. I am trying to put myself in their shoes to view their perspective as well, to see and understand what slurs they face but I am finding none (unless you have some, then please educate me on them). As a Hindu, my main observations I made are the 3 Bs, which are the focus of this post.\n\nWe first have the Baman slur. I face this slur on the regular living in Canada as I am a Brahmin myself, but truth is, this is used to describe Hindus in general. The religious difference is what gives this slur ammo. In Hindu Jaat areas like Haryana, there is more of the "Jaat Baman bhai bhai" trope because there is no religious difference, making it easier to eliminate caste divides. As the caste hierarchy in Punjab went through a bit of a shuffle which put Jatts on top, where they hold influence through mainly gurdwara positions and land, they seem to be targeting Brahmin Hindus a lot. Bamans lost a ton of land during the Punjab Hindu exodus after 1984 as they were quite often targets for anti-Hindu violence by Bhrindanwala and his goons. The slur came into popular use after this partition-era saying that a "Baman can never be a good friend, as they are always two faced". I do not understand why Bamans are associated with deceit and thus are the targets of hate-mongering? This is especially emphasized during the farmers protests where the whole Modi cabinet is attached with Hindus to allege some "Baman-led tyranny" just because it threatens the rich Jatt landowners with poverty reforms. I hear from some sources however, that Baman is the actual proper word for Brahman in Punjabi but it kind of seems used in a backhanded manner today (If any Punjabis are reading this, please educate me on if it is the right term).\n\nNext is the Bhaiyya slur. It is commonly used for specific Hindu migrants from Bihar and UP, describing how low-class these people are because they come from the lesser-developed states. There seems to be a lot of pretentiousness over perceived "filth" coming in to do mainly laborious jobs. Again, ditto on the Hindu Jaat areas like Haryana which do not practice this to the standard that the Sikh Jatt area does. Not trying to diss Punjab or anything, but their state is on the brink of implosion if water cuts out, leaving all the farms to crash and the state turning backwards. It legit only has Chandigarh to show for its development and they cannot rely on breadbasket procurements for long. I find it very hypocritical to shit on people moving to your land for a better opportunity just because they come from a perceived "shithole" state. But of course, this continues because they are far below Jatts in the hierarchy, leaving them to be Gypsy-targetted.\n\nThen we have the Baniya slur, used for Hindu merchants and businesspeople like the Aggarwals, with who the money lies with. This has shades of anti-Semitism in early Nazi Germany, as Jews were targeted due to their wealth and status. Jewish businesses were boycotted and were commonly referred to as thieves to justify their wealth as to push forward a scapegoat narrative. Mind you, during Kristallnacht, it was not Nazi party members out on the streets vandalizing Jew businesses, but rather youth gang members, showing how well the propaganda had worked. Although I doubt a Kristallnacht situation will happen in Punjab with Baniyas being victims, a scapegoat narrative might be built up due to the threat they pose to the Jatt hegemony with their financial success. I am not sure how much influence Jatts hold in the business sector, so if anyone has anything on that, please comment below.\n\nThere are a slew of backhanded slurs that they even use to denigrate other Sikhs. Bhappa is commonly used to shit on Khatris who do religious service. The infamous "choora" is used towards Chamars and Mazhabis. In their case, it just goes to show how caste system can be implemented in any faith, not exclusively Hinduism as it was vilified for. They longed for equality and then immediately afterwards, they became discriminated sweepers again. Even sometimes here in Canada, albeit not a caste slur, I hear "gyani" being thrown around in a backhanded way by Mona Sikhs to insult keshdhari Sikhs for how orthodox their turbans are, putting the priest sarcasm in. Guru Nanak, when he first found Sikhi, established the Singh and Kaur surnames as a way to hide caste and therefore veil judgement. This makes everyone equal and uniform so that we can focus on practicing our dharma and not engaging in pointless social status fights.\n\nIf you have any thoughts, perspectives, answers, education opportunities for me, complaints, or solutions, please do not hesitate to comment in the thread.'<br />Author: 'CanadianBhau'  id: 'nswbuy'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nswbuy/why_does_it_appear_that_rampant_casteism_is/</li>

There will be no exams. The teacher will decide when the student has learnt everything and give the student a certificate that they are now free to apply for college. That way the student-teacher bond will be strong, students will no longer mug up shit to pass and if anyone bribes the teacher into giving that certificate, their child won't be able to apply for college.\n\nSo this is just an idea.

Shouldn\'t the laws be more specific about what constitutes as threats to "the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India"? \n\nOtherwise in the future content creators like me or @MANJULtoons can be bullied to take down our content just because it doesn\'t align with the views of the government.'<br />Author: 'dr_wafu'  id: 'nsq6tn'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nsq6tn/should_the_internet_rules_be_made_more_specific/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Gyana Sambanda'<br />Body: 'Gyaana SambandarOne day my maternal  aunt took me early in the morning  to her cousins’ house . The house of my grand aunt was the typical Agraharam house of Mylapore . It had a central Muttam . with a well in the corner, a Basil plant in the centre  and a staircase that led up to 2 other floors. At 6 years,  my mind itched to unravel the mysteries of the upstairs. But aunt\'s and mother\'s words had held me back. The quelling of my critical mind goes way back then !  Suddenly I was huddled up to mystery mountain and the joy of getting to know behind Hows and Whys, sparkled bright  in my mind.  . In the big balcony up,  I was told to cling on to the railings of the balcony wall   . Aunts , cousin aunts, cousins grand aunt and great grand mother, all of us huddled to every well opened vista  for the view  outside. So what was special in this road today , my Why started ringing in my mind . I saw more than the usual amount of  people . And the throng swelled . People were looking on the left side with anticipation just as  the spectators awaiting the next hit from a star cricketer in a  stadium . I  saw chariots slowly appearing  in the left corner . People were touching  their cheeks crosswords.  Chariots with the idols of Shiva ,his consort Kalpaka - Ambika  followed .  The Utsavamoorthi of Shiva was bedecked with marigold , jasmine et al.   The whole street was filled with people and so were the different balconies of all the buildings around  .  Shopkeepers and  salesmen had a day free and were eagerly  looking out at the grand processions and the festivities.Then came the palanquins with other deities. “Who  are these Gods”, asked I to my aunt. “ The Nayanmars”, said she “ 63 of them, “. Then , a never ending array of palanquins!  My eyes swirled  up like the  pinwheel toys held up by the hawker across me .  The fragrance of Jasmine , marigold, oleander  , turmeric, vermilion , camphor and benzoin wafted as people jostled forward to offer their prayers to the Lord. A young mother sent her toddler up to the priest to have the blessings of the Lord. Some were offering baskets of flowers , fruits and coconut as offerings,  to the priest. Hawkers had teamed up with their ware. They held knick knacks that bewitched semi toddlers like me and colourful bangles and ribbons that inveigled  my   aunts .  Young, old ,the disabled , the very busy etc were all having a fest from  their own precincts. A procession of children dressed up as a young saint  led the way now . They were all dressed similarly and were distinct in their appearance as they had no facial hair.  Rudraksha adorned their head and the Vibhuthi with vermilion ,  their forehead and arms.What fun I thought,  to take part in this grandeur. I too wanted to be a small saint like those young children  and I tried get down to join them. But my aunt  ever watchful  caught me before i could leave the floor.I was agape with the  grandeur on the street and  the play toys held up by  hawkers . My mind was on pinwheel  toy I had seen from up above the balcony .  It  was plotting devious ways to inveigle my aunt to buy it for me. I soon forgot about those children and their sainthood .Later,  I remember to have seen the re run of a movie on this young saint   , in Doordarshan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.College days,. Our  library was as huge as these chariots that held and swayed the lord . One day there  , I chanced upon a book on  Kerala history. I have long since  forgotten the title. But I do remember a chapter on a Tamil "sorcerer". He was reviving the dead and changing barren land with laden crops . All with  a whiff  of his incantations and a puff of his Ashes , it said.Gyanasambandar ! He intrigued me aplenty. The  child saint as whom the young children had adorned as!Who is this Gyana Samband ? Gyana means Knowledge . Samband means binding or relationship.  There was a famous saint named Sekkizhar .  He wrote a magnum opus on the 63  saints , the Nayanmars . He called his book as the "Big Old" or the " Periya Puranam".  It is a book that none of the spiritual aspirants should  miss .Gyana Samband was one of the most important of these 63 saints. These saints were from the different social strata of society. From even the so called lowest class as that of a butcher to the " upper class " of a king. They were all rooted in the mysteries of the Soul. They were in awe of Shiva or the Parabrahman. While they were busy unravelling these mysteries they also spread the thirst for this quest  to the people of Tamil Nadu. They said that it was only through a great fortune one was born in Bharatam and know  about the Lord !Gyana Samband was born in a family of Shiva devotees. As a toddler of 3 years he is said to have composed highly suffused philosophical verses which were set to the music of classical score.  Once his parents took him to a temple. They had a particular chore within  the temple and had left the toddler alone in the long verandas inside of  the temple.  Now something important  held back the parents a little longer than usual. As they returned back while in half anxiety , they saw, to their relief,   their child sitting contend and happy.  Milk was oozing out from his mouth. The parents anxious that their child could have troubled someone asked him angrily what mischief he had been upto. But the child pointed to the skies and said that the Divine couple had fed him with milk. Immediately  he burst into raptures of divine outpourings . This was Gyana Samband\'s first song or Pathikam/ Padigam/ post.People from near and far  heard about the genius of this child and flocked to visit him. This was not an ordinary feat by a small child, they marvelled.This  divine child\'s fame spread far and wide. Because he was also creating miracles. He was resuscitating the utterly sick, changing the fortunes of highly defunct financial or agricultural enterprises and even  reviving the dead. Record of these miracles can be found in various sources.This divine child was invited to great spiritual assemblies and royal courts. By his precept and example he spread the awareness of Shiva consciousness. More and more kings and their kingdoms realised the importance of the human birth and converted to his way of philosophy. Sambandar sang in temples and today these temples have become famous as "the temples where Samband sang" / " Paadal Petra Sthalam"Sambandar was accompanied by a singing minstrel  , Yazpanar or the minstrel with the music instrument Yazz ( Jazz?)  Together they composed and sang their  spiritual outpourings set in poetical metres and in classical musical score.  These outpourings were called the Thevarams/ Devaarams/ the Arathi\'s to Deva, Shiva.Appar the older saint joined this divine child saint . Together they spread the awareness and love for Siva  among the people.They made people realise the reason for their birth. That is: Not to be born again!The Naayanmaars were from different castes of the society in Tamil Nadu. Most were from the so called " lowly" castes such as   cobblers, potters , et al. -.Yazpanar was one such. Appar was a Vellalar ( people who ruled with the Vel/ spear). They called in for oneness of humanity and the  realisation that every human was the embodiment of the One God.  The Nayanmaars revived the message that the birth of a human was for a very high purpose and that purpose was never to be forgotten.Gyana Sambandar after his 15 glorious years on this mortal earth merged with Shiva , along with his bride and other Shiva devotees, on his wedding ceremony day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rrodeuks7371.png?width=133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b231acba7c508886f3d049b887b7daab4c8915d8'<br />Author: 'SquareBobcat6'  id: 'ns0miy'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ns0miy/gyana_sambanda/</li>

Of the 10,000-odd firms analyzed as part of a global report that projects the space tech economy to touch $500 billion by 2025, over 5,500 are in the US, followed by the UK, Canada, and Germany. The report lists 368 firms in India compared to 288, 269, and 206 in China, France, and Spain, respectively. Japan and Russia have 184 and 56, respectively.\n\nISRO chairman K Sivan said: “There has been a good response from the industry, both big and small. The number of proposals with IN-SPACe has also gone up by around 30% compared to the end of 2020.” As per the report by Spacetech Analytics titled ‘SpaceTech Industry 2021/Q2 Landscape Overview’, most companies globally (2,820) are in navigation and mapping, followed by 1,000 manufacturing firms, 718 doing space communication, remote sensing (211), aerial imaging (152), spacecraft development (80), space travel (58), and space medicine (48).\n\nThe report, which projects the space tech economy to touch $10 trillion by 2030 from the current $380 billion, has also analyzed investments made in such companies during the said quarter. It has reviewed 10,000 firms, 5,000 investors, 150 R&amp;D hubs and associations, and 130 government organizations across the world.\n\nSource: Economic Times &amp; Times of India, 3rd June 2021'<br />Author: 'Iam-KD'  id: 'nrh72p'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nrh72p/with_over_350_private_space_companies_india_in/</li>

They said the concept of third gender is a foreign import and is not inherent in Hinduism. \n\nBut I want to believe otherwise. As far as I know according Hindu epistemology God/Brahman is presented as being both immanent and transcendent, pervading all that is sentient and inanimate within the Creation and yet existing beyond the creation. Brahman is beyond description, without name, without form, without shape and without gender. They state that every being is an eternal soul/atman, incarnate and that the ultimate goal of life is not heaven, but rather “moksha”, freedom from the cycle of birth and death. Moksha is attained by one’s real self, or atman, which is distinct from one’s physical body and personality as well as outer attributes such as race, caste, gender, and sexual orientation. So I believe that gender has no role in attaining moksha and that Hinduism entirely supports the notion that gender is a fluid as opposed to a fixed concept.\n\nAnd I also don’t want to believe that third gender is a foreign import since, Hindu epics mention several characters which demonstrate a range of sexual orientations and gender identities, including Shikhandi, Chitrangada (wife of Arjuna and mother of Babruvahana), and Brihannala from the Mahabharata. None of these characters are discriminated against because of sexual orientation or gender identity.  Rather, they are all treated with respect, and judged by their abilities rather than by their sexuality.\n\nLong before US activists, feminist brigades and academics ‘discovered’ the rights of gender variants and started marching with rainbow flags, India had already been celebrating “Koovagam transgender festival” and created gender specific empowerment spaces for genders beyond the conventional.\n\nIn essence I believe Hindu teachings hold the inherent spiritual equality of all beings, regardless of outer attributes. \n\nI want to know the opinion of sub or what you believe the Hindu stance on LGBTQ+ is?\n\nThank you.'<br />Author: 'Im_impossible'  id: 'nqd3a8'<br />Score:94<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nqd3a8/hinduisms_approach_to_lgbtq/</li>

In such a scenario, even this specific surgery for sterilization purposes won't actually be enough and it would thus be time to go more drastic. But of course I wouldn't actually be able to afford an elective prostatectomy here in the US, which is why I would have to travel somewhere where it is much cheaper to get it done instead, such as travelling to India assuming that it will actually be safe to do this by that point in time.\n\nSo, Yeah, what exactly are the cheapest places in India (or, alternatively, elsewhere in the developing world) for an English-speaking foreigner to get a prostatectomy done?

      <li>Title::: 'Follow up:... And then I lost my mom too to Covid. Bangalore is Gone-City.'<br />Body: 'I made a post less than [a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n5vut1/bangalore_is_in_a_terrible_state_we_have_greatly/) mentioning that I lost my dad to Covid 19 (30th Apr) and my mom was in the ICU. Both of them had 1 shot of covidshield (Astrazenca). Disclaimer: Take the vaccine, but also be aware of the effects.\n\nAfter fighting it really hard for over 20 days, she succumbed to the damage that Covid has caused to her lungs, which couldn\'t be reversed (29th May). She was in a critical state for this time, until she wasn\'t. She crashed in a few hours - was at full O2 usage and needed 3 units of noradrenalin to keep her BP up, soon in a few hours had a cardiac arrest, and was unresponsive to resuscitation. \n\nAs she was was tested negative upon her death, and for eyewash purpose, she may not be registered as a Covid-19 death (IDK). \n\nThe situation in Bangalore is more or less the same. If you\'re seeing lesser infections, and deaths it is mostly because people are either dead or they died from the aftermath. The crematoriums are still full-ish.\n\nMy family friends who are taking covid-19 (Covidshield vaccines) in Bangalore are have massive symptoms (Age 21, blue lips, vomiting, etc) having to go to Hospital ICUs, who then kick them out for patients who would be staying longer and paying more (i.e: "More critical care cases"). Others who get the jab, get the disease from the vaccine centers. \n\nMy 20yr old sister is alone at home. There is no earning member in the family, and my mom has left behind massive secured debts. I don\'t know what will happen of us, as we take one day at a time. I am in a border locked country (Aus), where flights are locked. \n\nWhere I am, I don\'t talk about it because "Oh yes, India is highly populated, these things would happen. You had that kumbh mela." notes of \'sympathy\' and ofcourse the best are "The population needed to reduce anyway..."\n\nWhat worries me for her is the oncoming dirtiness/cruelty of our \'pristine\' society - "Oh you are orphans, you must not be very well raised", "your life choices are due to lack of parents"...and what not. Oh yeah, and the best part, "**If you need ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL! let us know and we are here for you**" - wtf does this even mean? When you ask them for something, if it is inconvenient in anyway they say \'no\' by weaseling out excuses. If you cannot define what kind of help you can render, then it is just lip service. \n\nWhat continues to be a disappointment is our own people. If you ask any opposition, other general public (Who doesn\'t like the govt) they have the \'you voted them for you government, this was bound to happen. You reap what you sow\' attitude. If you ask the elected governments, \'responsibility if of the center / state / regional, etc, we gave them money and instruction.\' Neither of these options are an effort to solve the issue - Indian prime talent continues to remain: Political capacity. We can do nothing else.\n\nThe concept in democracy of "Once the election is over we all work towards development and survival together" **is long lost**. This event has broken down existing fault lines. This form of Democracy just does not work. Even if a 33% united majority has voted for a party, 67% become everyone\'s enemies. A large section from the 67% start working ton undermine these efforts of the the 33%. \n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nNon-political aspects, while doctors are doing their best - all other stakeholders are doing their very best to overprice umbrellas when it rains. Hospitals, Scammers who are taking advantages, essential resource hoarders.\n\nThe only saving grace are a few good people who are trying to do their best - family friends, some other people. I am afraid, most of these people would catch the infection too and I hope they survive. \n\nThe only thing I have understood is that - we can expect nothing out of the country. Regardless of the people in power, regardless of the party, regardless of who is administering, regardless of supportive individuals are. \n\nTL;DR: As a society we have truly failed. The disappointment is bottomless. \n\nGood luck to all the gladiators out there.'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'npk7a9'<br />Score:448<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/npk7a9/follow_up_and_then_i_lost_my_mom_too_to_covid/</li>

I don't like this  government nor do I valiantly hate it with all my heart like thousands  of people in that sub.\n\nBut one  thing for sure that pisses me off to the core is the amount of hatred  they have for their country, Sure Our country is bad there's no denying  it, but there is a problem with how you only want to hear bad things and  ignore all the good things. It's almost like you don't want to see the  balance of good and bad things.

You know damn well that any foreign channel that\'s dedicated entirely to "reacting to India" is likely well aware that its easy clicks (sure, *some* of them may be genuinely interested in our country). Why the hell do we have this inferiority complex and go gaga every time some foreigner flatters us on YouTube? Or go so far as to be outright racist/xenophobic towards all non-Indians and sometimes even NRIs, tout "national pride" while knowing damn well that we\'re still a 3rd world country. And then we have these irritating libs who are likewise too desperate for left wing approval abroad, and present our country in the worst possible light in any given situation.\n\nLike, every time there\'s a tweet about Islamist extremism or an instance of such abroad, that story just trends in India more than the affected countries themselves. The Nice incident in France likewise took off on Indian twitter while the French social media was upvoting a huge post that read "we don\'t want the support of Hindu extremists" (or something to that effect) whom they associate with their own far right nationalists, all while guys from our country kept simping for France and Macron as if they care about us. They never did and they never will, so why do we? Why are we so irrational and so emotional that we flock just about anywhere simply out of spite? Same thing with Israel, now sure, they\'re more pro-India and all but come on, the degree of virtue signalling our RW did for Israel and our LW did for Palestine was beyond tolerance.\n\nI guess my point is that our internet activity is extremely cringe, due to our libs and ultranationalists alike.

But the\ntruth is that the most serious threat to India’s security comes from the vast network\nof activist NGOs, human rights organizations and India’s pseudo-secular lobby\nwhich are all now collectively known as civil society groups. These civil society\ngroups, supported, funded and controlled by some western intelligence and church\nagencies, pose a very grave threat to the very survival of India as a sovereign\nnation. Many of these organizations which were first established in India as charity\norganizations, later changed their colour and started showing their fangs by\nsupporting various militant and secessionist movements in the country. The NGO\nand human rights activism got a big boost in the early 1970s with the patronage it\nreceived from Sonia Gandhi who came to India in 1968 as the Italian ‘bahu’ of\nIndia’s former prime minister Indira Gandhi. The origin of many militant people’s\nmovements like Narmada Bachao Andolan and Kastakari Sanghatana which were\nstarted in the mid-1970s and the take over of the Maoist movement by the pro-US\nNGO lobby can be traced to this NGO-Sonia nexus. With Rajiv Gandhi becoming\nthe Prime Minister of India in 1984, there was a substantial increase in the NGO\nlobby’s political influence in the country with the successful induction of many of\nits nominees into key positions of power in the administration under different\nministries.\n\n#Four crucial legislations\n\n&gt;In 1992, two very important legislations i.e. 73d and 74th amendments to the\nConstitution were passed by the Parliament, with the avowed objective of\nstrengthening the institutions of Panchayat Raj and urban bodies through\ndecentralization of power, allegedly meant to allow the people at the lowest level\nto take part in the decision making process. Some NGO activists had played a very\nkey, but behind-the- scene role, in getting these two amendment bills passed in the\nParliament. It was under the pressure of these activists and also with the support of\nthe top leadership of the Congress party, the Constitution (73d and 74th )\nAmendment Bills, were finally passed by the Parliament in December, 1992. \nThe two Acts came into force on April 24, 1993, giving necessary constitutional\nsanction to the Panchayat Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies in India.\nCreation of Area Sabha or Mohalla Sabha under the Ward Committee\n\n&gt;In December, 2005, a city modernization scheme called the Jawaharlal Nehru\nNational Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) was launched by Prime Minister\nManmohan Singh, and under this mission a Community Participation Law (CPL)\nwas made mandatory to be enacted in the states, which involves constitution of\nArea Sabhas (or Mohalla Sabhas) enabling further decentralization of urban bodies\nbelow the Ward Committees. The law has been made mandatory by making it a\ncondition to avail funding under JNNRUM. The Community Participation Law\n(CPL), also termed as ‘Nagar Raj Bill’ is an elaborate law that prescribes the\nstructure, powers and functions of the Area Sabha and it also prescribes the\nconstitution and governance of the ward committees. As per this law, the hierarchy\nof representation after the municipal body would be the ward committees followed\nby Area Sabhas. Thus the Area Sabha or the Mohalla Sabha would be the lowest\nunit in the hierarchy as far as the urban bodies are concerned.\n\n&gt;Welcoming the passage of these two amendment bills, the NGO activists had\nboasted that the two Acts would help India to realize Gandhiji’s dream concept of\nGram Swaraj. The NGO activists had been strongly advocating the need for\nstrengthening the Panchayat Raj system and empowering the village Panchayats in\nthe country, since last three decades. Their demand had the whole-hearted backing\nof some senior Congress politicians like Mani Shankar Iyer, Jairam Ramesh and\nRahul Gandhi. When the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was voted to\npower in 2004, one of the first major decisions of the new government was the\ncreation of a separate ministry for Panchayat Raj, and entrusting the charge of the\nnew ministry to Mani Shankar Iyer. It shows the importance that the UPA\ngovernment attached to the strengthening of Panchayat institutions in India. The\ncreation of an independent ministry for Panchayati Raj by the UPA government in\nMay, 2004 was actually the fruition of an idea cherished by the NGO action group\nlobby in India led by Sonia Gandhi.\n\nPanchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996.\n\n&gt;Another important legislation called Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas)\nAct, (PESA), which granted extension of the idea of local self-governance to tribal\nregions in the country, was also passed by the Parliament in 1996. The PESA was\nenacted on the basis of the recommendations of the Bhuria Committee.\nBhuria Committee\n\n&gt;The Narasimha Rao government had appointed a committee headed by M.Dileep\nSingh Bhuria, MP in 1994, to work out the details as to how structures similar to\nPanchayat institutions can take shape in Tribal Areas and Scheduled Areas and to\ndefine their powers. The committee consisted of the following members.\n\n1) Dilip Singh Bhuria (MP), Chairman.\n\n2) Khagapati Pradhani (MP)\n\n3) Prof.M.Kamson (MP)\n\n4) Dr.B.D.Sharma (Expert)\n\n5) Dr.Bhupinder Singh (Expert)\n\n6) Bandi Oraon (vice Chairman,SC/ST Commission)\n\n7) Smt.Sushama Singh, Jt Secretary (Monitoring), Convener.\n\n&gt;The Committee submitted its report in January, 1995. It was on the basis of\nrecommendations of this Committee, a bill called Panchayat (Extension to\nScheduled Areas) Bill was introduced in the Parliament and passed on December\n19, 1996. It was subsequently assented to by the President on December 24, 1996.\nThus the central act was extended to all tribal and scheduled areas as specified by\nthe Constitution.\n\nSalient Provisions of the PESA Act\n\n1) In scheduled areas, every village will have a Gram Sabha.\n\n2) Minimum 50% seats should be reserved for STs at all tiers of Panchayats.\n\n3) Chairpersons at all levels of Panchayats shall be reserved for STs\n\n4) Every legislation on the Panchayats in scheduled areas shall be in conformity\nwith the customary law, social and religious practices and traditional management\npractice of the community resources.\n\n&gt;Powers and authority of Gram Sabhas and Panchayats in Scheduled Areas\nGram Sabha has the power to safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of\npeople, their cultural identity, community resources and customary mode of\ndispute resolutions. It also has power to approve plans, programmes and projects\nfor social and economic development, to identify persons as beneficiaries under\npoverty alleviation programmes and to give certificate of utilization of funds for\nvarious plans and programmes.\n\n&gt;The recommendations of Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayats will be mandatory for\ngrant of prospecting license on mining lease for minor minerals in the area.\nGram Sabha has the right to ownership of minor forest produce, to prevent\nalienation of land, to manage village markets, to exercise control over money\nlending, to exercise control over institutions and functionaries in all social sectors\nand to control over local plans and resources for such plans including tribal subplans.\nState legislations may endow Panchayats with such powers and authority as may\nbe necessary to enable them to function as Institutions of Self-governance.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayats_(Extension_to_Scheduled_Areas)_Act_1\n996)\nhttp://www.gktoday.in/blog/panchayats-extension-to-the-scheduled-areas-act1996/\n\nThe Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of\nForests Rights) Act\n\n&gt;In 2006, another NGO-sponsored Bill, called ‘The Scheduled Tribes and Other\nTraditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forests Rights) Act, 2006 was passed\nby the Parliament, which granted the right of ownership of land and control over\nminor forest produce and natural resources to the inhabitants of the tribal areas.\nThis Act, also called the Forest Rights Act, was originally drafted by some NGO\nactivists led by Pradip Prabhu, an NGO leader working among the tribals of Thane\ndistrict in Maharashtra. Pradeep Prabhu had also conducted a nation- wide\ncampaign by holding morchas and demonstrations throughout the country in\nassociation with other like-minded activist groups in other states to mobilize\nsupport for this Bill.\n\n&gt;As per this new Act, Panchayats in tribal areas have now become the controlling\nauthority for forest management at the ground level, replacing the control of the \nForest Department. At a meeting held during the third week of May, 2010 between\nUnion Minister of state for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh and Union\nMinister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, C.P.Joshi, it was decided to\nremove Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) from the control of the\nDistrict Forest Officer and instead bring them under the control of the Gram\nSabhas and forest Panchayats. This is now being implemented in the tribal areas\nthat come under the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas ) Act (PESA), 1996.\nThe JFMCs are the basic units of participatory forest management at local level\nwhich will take into consideration the views of all stakeholders. However the civil\nrights activists have sabotaged this system with their political influence, and\nmanaged to bring them under the Gram Sabhas.\n\n&gt;Thus the Gram Sabhas would now control all the funding that is routed through the\none lakh JFMCs across the country for various forestry-related schemes. The\nmoney will now be routed through the forest panchayats in tribal areas. Forest\nDepartment staff will be made accountable to the Panchayats on all relevant issues.\nPanchayat institutions will have to be consulted before making any decision or\ndeclaration involving the forest land. Thus the staff of the Forest Department,\nwhose primary duty is to protect the forest from forest dwellers and outsiders,\nwould now work under the Gram Sabha or Forest Panchayat formed by the forest\ndwellers, and take orders from them. All the forestry-related funds also would be\ncontrolled by the Gram Sabha. \n\n(http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tpnational/tp-tamilnadu/forest-management-panels-to-come-under-gramsabha/article862402.ece).\n\n&gt;In a federal republic like India, it is the Union government and various state\ngovernments that wield all the powers and perform all the functions of the\ngovernment. With the passage of the 73d and 74th Amendment to the Constitution\nActs, the division of powers and functions of the government have now been\ntrickled down to local self governments i.e. Panchayats and Gram Sabhas in rural\nareas and Ward Committees and Area (Mohalla) Committees in urban areas. **With\nthe passage of Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act and the Forest Rights\nAct, the Schedule-V areas and tribal areas have also been brought under the\npurview of this three-tier system of governance. But, why should the civil society\nactivists, who have been supporting all anti-national movements in India like the\nMaoist movement, Kashmiri separatists, Tamil nationalist organizations and\nagitations against various mega development projects in India, have suddenly\nbecome the champions of a Gandhian concept like Gram Swaraj and empowerment\nof Gram Sabhas, Mohalla Sabhas and Forest Panchayats?**\n\nConspiracy behind hijacking of Gandiji’s Gram Swaraj concept.\n\n&gt;The Panchayat Raj is a system of governance in which the gram panchayats are the\nbasic units of administration. It functions at three levels at gram (village), tehsil\n(block) and zilla (district). Mahatma Gandhi was a strong advocate of the\nPanchayat Raj system, a decentralized form of government where each village will\nbe responsible for its own affairs and had described it as Gram Swaraj (village selfgovernance). \n\n&gt;In January 1957, the Government of India had appointed a special\ncommittee headed by Balwant Rai Mehta to examine the working of the\nCommunity Development Programme (CDP) and National Extension Service\n(NES) and to suggest measures to improve the functioning of the CDP and NES.\nThe report submitted by the Mehta Committee and approved by the government in\n1958 had set the stage for the establishment of Panchayat Raj institutions in India.\nThe committee had recommended for the launch of a scheme for the democratic\ndecentralization of power which subsequently came to be known as Panjayat Raj.\nAs per the 3-tier Panchayat Raj system recommended by the Mehta committee,\nthere will be a gram panchayat at the village level, a panchayat samiti at the block\nlevel and a zilla parishad at the district level.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balwant_Rai_Mehta_Committee\n\n&gt;About thirty years after the implementation of the Mehta Committee report on\nPanchayat Raj, the civil society activists suddenly raked up the issue again in the\n1980s, demanding decentralization of power right up to the lowest level of\nPanchayat institutions so as to allow the people at the grassroots level to participate\nin the decision making process, which alone according to them, will help to realize\nGandhiji’s dream concept of Swaraj.\n\n&gt;Article 243(A) of the Constitution says that the Gram Sabha may exercise such\npowers and perform such functions at village level as the Legislature of a State\nmay, by law, provide. It is under this provision, that the State Legislatures have\nendowed certain powers to the Gram Sabha relating to village development.\n\n&gt;However, the powers given to the Gram Sabha under this provision were confined\nonly to discuss, debate and scrutinize the reports on socio-economic development\nprogrammes implemented by the gram panchayat and the annual statement of\naccounts and audit reports for the previous year. Thus the Gram Sabha did not have\nany real powers to implement any scheme. However, **the provisions of the\nPachayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), has not only\nextended development, planning and audit functions to the Gram Sabhas, but also\nendowed it with powers for management and control of natural resources and \nadjudication of justice in accordance with local traditions and customs.** While the\n73d Amendment to the Constitution passed by the Parliament in 1992 was aimed to\nstrengthen the Panchayat Raj institutions at the lower levels and empower them to\ntake part in the decision making process under the decentralized governance, the\n74th Amendment to the Constitution in 1992 was intended to facilitate\ndecentralization of urban governance. The 74th Amendment required the state\ngovernments to amend their municipal laws in order to empower the urban local\nbodies with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to\nfunction as institutions of self governance. This Amendment in its section 243- S\nprovides for setting up of Ward Committees to ensure citizen participation in\ndecision making. Thus the 73d and 74th Constitution Amendment Acts of 1992\nprovided constitutional mandate for decentralization of governance and creating\nunits of local self government at both the rural and urban settlement levels.\n\nSinister designs.\n\n&gt;**The NGO lobby’s sudden love and interest in empowering the Gram Sabhas and its\nproclaimed aim to strengthen the Panchayat Raj system has some sinister designs.\nTheir aim is not simply to strengthen the Panchayat Raj, but to take control of the\nempowered Panchayat institutions throughout the country. When the provisions of\nthe Panchayat Raj are fully implemented, there would not be much powers left\nwith the state and district administration and those who control the Panchayat\ninstitutions in rural areas and Mohalla Sabhas in urban areas would become the\nreal rulers of the country. Without the consent of the Gram Sabha, no mining\nproject, whether it is coal, bauxite, iron ore or uranium, can be undertaken by the\ngovernment, or any development project can come up under the jurisdiction of the\nGram Sabha and the Mohalla Sabha. In rural areas, where the major industrial and\ndevelopment projects are concentrated and new ones are scheduled to come up, the\nGram Sabhas are almost fully under the control of the NGO activist groups. It is\nwith such sinister designs that the militant NGOs are concentrating on organizing\nthe masses in the remote rural and tribal areas and pressing for full implementation\nof the 73d and 74th amendment of the Constitution.** \n\n&gt;**It is easy for the foreignfunded NGOs, who work in the remote tribal and rural areas to influence the poor\nand illiterate village elders by bribing them with liquor and money and control the\nGram Sabhas. Militant NGOs have already established their control over thousands\nof Gram Sabhas in states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra\nPradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra. The Gram Sabhas are\nnow used by the NGO-sponsored anti-development lobby to stall hundreds of\nmega development projects, including coal, bauxite and other mining projects, in\nthese states in a bid to stall our economic progress at the behest of their funding \nagencies in the west. For instance, all the 12 Gram Gabhas controlled by the NGO\nlobby in Rayagada and Kalahandi districts of Odisha have voted against the\nRs.50000 crore aluminium refinery project of Vedanta Resources in the\nNiyamagiri hills in August, 2013.**\n\n(http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/12th-gram-sabha-too-votes-againstvedanta-mining/article5039304.ece)\n\n&gt;The grand strategy of the NGO lobby to build up militant people’s movements all\nover the country and cultivating/inducting a large network of agents in various\nministries and government departments, including the judiciary and armed forces,\nfinally resulted in the creation of a gigantic octopus- like NGO war machine with\nits tentacles tightening its grip over the entire country with every passing day. This\nwas made possible because of the help and close cooperation extended to the NGO\nlobby by Sonia Gandhi from the seventies onwards. **Subsequently, with the support\nand patronage of Sonia Gandhi, the NGO lobby was able to get some very\nimportant but dangerous legislations, like the 73d and 74th Amendment to the\nConstitution (1992), Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act 1996\n(PESA), and the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers\n(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, passed by the Parliament. These bills\nwere passed in the Parliament with the proclaimed objective of promoting\ndecentralization of power up to the grassroots level for the realization of Gandhiji’s\ndream concept of ‘Swaraj’. However, this so-called dream concept is actually a\ncunning strategy devised by the western intelligence agencies to grant total\nautonomy and self-rule to all the states in India by using the sweet terms like\nempowering the Gram Sabhas and Mohalla Sabhas all across India. With various\nmilitant and separatist movements dominating many border states and interior parts\nof India, what could happen to the idea of India if total autonomy and self-rule is\ngranted to such regions?** Clearly the only aim of crooks like Arvind Kejriwal,\nRahul Gandhi, Jairam Ramesh and Mani Shankar Aiyar, who are the staunchest\nsupporters of this ‘Swaraj’ movement, is to facilitate the process of India’s\nbalkanization as desired by their masters in the west. Arvind Kejriwal, a Ford\nFoundation- trained social activist, who earned fame through his active\nparticipation in the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement of 2011 had even\nwritten a book titled ‘Swaraj’ in 2012, supporting and propagating the concept of\nSwaraj and decentralization of power.\n\nSeparatists demand extension of PESA to Jammu &amp; Kashmir\n\n&gt;**The NGO activists and the separatists in Kashmir valley who are opposed to the\nextension of any new Indian laws to Jammu and Kashmir quoting the provisions\nof the Article 370, however have been pressing for the extension of 73d and 74th\nconstitutional amendments relating to empowerment of Panchayat and Muncipal\ninstitutions to Jammu and Kashmir.** Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi during\nhis visit to Jammu and Kashmir in the first week of November, 2013 had also\nasserted that the situation in the state would change for the better once the 73d and\n74th constitutional amendments were incorporated into the J&amp;K Panchayat Raj\nAct. The 73d amendment deals with empowering Panchayar Raj institutions while\nthe 74th amendment would make the ward committees and Mohalla Sabhas as selfgoverning bodies in the urban areas. **Underlying treachery behind this move is that,\nwhen fully implemented, these amendments would help the Jammu and Kashmir to\nget complete autonomy and self rule which will help the state to legally secede\nfrom India**\n\nGaon Ganrajya or village republic movement in India\n\n&gt;**After the passage of 73d and 74th Constitutional Amendment bills in 1992 and\nPESA in 1996, the NGO activists had started a campaign among the villagers all\nacross the country, especially in Schedule-V areas in states like Rajasthan,\nJharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya\nPradesh and Himachal Pradesh, educating the villagers about the vast powers that\nhave been granted to the Gram Sabhas through these new legislations.** They point\nout to the villagers that they no more will have to go to the forest officials or any\nother government agency for resolving their various problems and grievances as\ntheir own gram sabha (village assembly) has been empowered to attend and\naddress all such problems as per the new legislations meant to promote selfgovernance. \n\n&gt;#However, these activists have also be advocating the villagers to declare their self-governed village as a Gaon Ganrajya (village republic) so as to avail the full powers and benefits of the gram sabha empowerment legislations. In Rajasthan, NGOs like Jan Chetana Sansthan and Astha (affiliated to Action Aid India) have been in the forefront in guiding the villagers in setting up village republics in scheduled-V areas in the state like Dungarpur, Banswara, Chittaurgarh, Sirohi and Udapur. Manathgaon village in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan is one of the first to declare itself as a village republic. Since then, many more such village republics have been established in scheduled-V areas of other states like Jharkhand, Chhttisgarh and Maharashtra under the guidance of different NGOs. Once a village is declared as a Gan Rajya or Village Republic, the villagers erect a stone slab at the entrance of the village declaring itself as a self-ruled  village republic with its constitution inscribed on it. In these villages, the residents control their natural resources like forests, land, minerals and water sources. They have formed necessary institutions to manage the resources. Government officials and programmes can be accepted only if approved by the Gram Sabha. The forest department, police and other officials are restricted to execute only those programmes and decisions chalked out by the Gram Sabha.\n\n\n&gt;#Many Gram Sabhas in the country, empowered by the 73d amendment to the Constitution and the PESA Act of 1996, have already become very powerful and have started asserting its powers under instigation from certain foreign-funded NGOs. A private mining company had started work on a bauxite mining project at Nimalapedu in Visakhapatnam in 1992. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that without the consent of the Gram Sabha, no mining can be permitted. Hence the said Rs.256 crore project had to be abandoned. In February 2002, the Andhra Pradesh High Court had scrapped an irrigation project in East Godavary district, as it was not permitted by the Gram Sabha. In December 2000, when Maharashtra governor P.C.Alexander had to go on an official visit to Mendha village near Gadchiroli, the district collector had to take necessary permission from the Gram Sabha, in virtual acknowledgement of the village’s sovereignty.(Down to Earth, August 31,2002). \n\n&gt;#If this is the power enjoyed by a Gram Sabha under the PESA, then what will happen to the country if all the four\nlegislations, granting self-governance to all Gram Sabhas (under 73d amendment), urban bodies (under 74th Amendment to the Constitution), Scheduled-V areas (under PESA) and Forest Panchayats (under Forest Rights Act) are fully implemented in the entire country? \n\n&gt;**India will become a union of tens of thousands\nof mini sovereign republics. The state and central administration will be paralyzed.\nThe security forces would not be able to even enter the troubled areas. The\njudiciary will have to look on helplessly, and that will be the end of India. Our\nParliamentarians have obviously helped to enact the four controversial legislations\nwithout applying their mind. What the government can do now is to take necessary\nurgent steps to get the four controversial legislations annulled.**\n\nComments\n\n&gt;**Ever since India’s independence in 1947, both the US and UK and the Christian\nmissionaries in India were found involved in promoting separatist movements,\nmainly in the northeastern region and Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Though India was a poor\ncountry, the western agencies knew that India with its vast size and population had\nthe potential to grow and emerge as a powerful country in the world some time in\nthe future, a possibility that they were not very comfortable with. They all wanted \na further division of India so as to put a cap on the growth potential of a giant\ncountry like India. This is the reason for the support of the US and its NATO allies\nfor all the militant and secessionist movements in India for all these years. All\ninsurgency movements in northeast were promoted and funded by the church and\nother western agencies, with the church concentrating more on conversion\nactivities. The NSCN leaders Isac Chisi Swu and Th. Muivah who were camping\nmostly abroad in cities like Bangkok, Paris and Zurich were controlling their\norganizational activities in India with the support of the church and some\ninternational NGOs. Th Muivah and Isac Chisi Swu returned to India only after\nsigning a peace treaty with Indian authorities in 1997.**\n\n&gt;It is under pressure from the US and UK, exerted through Mrs and Mr\nMountbatten, that Prime Minister Nehru, despite being in a winning position in the\nfirst conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir, took the Kashmir issue to the UN in\n1948 where it remained frozen for all these years, allowing the aggressor to enjoy\nthe fruits of its aggression. During the 1971 war with Pakistan over the flow of\nrefugees from East Pakistan, both the US and UK were ready to intervene in the\nwar in support of Pakistan and it was the timely help rendered by the Soviet Union\nthat helped India to liberate East Pakistan and pave the birth of Bangladesh.\nBangladesh president Mujibur Rehman and most of his family members were\neliminated in a military coup in 1975, which was a joint operation by the ISI and\nthe CIA. Pakistan president Gen. Zia ul Haq adopted terror as a state policy to\navenge India, with the full support and approval of the US. The Khalistan\nmovement, LTTE and the Maoist problem in India were also promoted by the US\nand its allies to create chaos and destabilization in India. The US was very upset by\nthe killing of LTTE leader Prabhakaran in the civil war in Sri Lanka only because\nit frustrated the US plan to use Prabhakaran to start a violent Tamil separatist\nmovement in Tamil Nadu. The Khalistani movement is almost dead in Punjab, but\nit is still kept alive in countries like the US, Canada, the UK, Germany and France\nwith the support of the US and its allies. All these events clearly show how deeply\nthe US and its allies are addicted to their evil intention of breaking up India. It also\nshows that Pakistan, despite its close friendship with China, still remains as a close\nally of the US.\n\n&gt;Modi’s emergence as the Prime Minister of India was a big blow to all antinational forces in India. As long as he remains as the prime minister of India,\nIndia’s enemies, both within and outside India, may not try to misuse these\nsubversive laws to threaten the unity and integrity of India. But, **in case of his\nremoval from power by any chance, all enemies of Modi and the idea of India \nwould come together to ensure the balkanization of India. Hence, all these\nsubversive laws must go.**\n\nhttp://vpmthane.org/vpmDDSS/pdf/Article/51-A%20western%20conspiracy%20aimed%20at%20balkanization%20of%20India%20through%20gaon%20ganrajya%20(village%20republic)%20movement.%20.pdf'<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'np63zl'<br />Score:95<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/np63zl/a_western_policy_aimed_at_balkanization_of_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India desperately needs a biowarfare defence policy and strategy in place, especially in the light of recent news that covid could be a lab generated virus.'<br />Body: "In 1975, the USA was conducting a research experiment on mosquitoes in Sonepat, Haryana. The aim of the research was to release a large number of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes into the general population to understand how mosquitoes bite people and how they spread diseases like dengue.\n\n\nThe research team planned to release hundreds of thousands of these mosquitoes until the then PM Indira Gandhi put a stop to it fearing that the Americans might be conducting an experiment of a bioweapon.\n\n\nThe Americans were undaunted and conducted it in their own country but with safety precautions and informed volunteers instead of no safety and unsuspecting population of millions. \n\n\nThe objective of the study was to determine if mosquitoes were a good delivery system for a bioweapon such as a manipulated dengue pathogen.\n\n\nThis was not the first time the USA has tested bioweapon on foreign soil. And nor was it their first time testing it on their own population either.\n\n\n\n##Germ warfare tested on civilians and enemy armed combatants - \n\nIn 1950, the USA government conducted operation seaspray where the US navy sprayed a deadly bacteria named Serratia marcescens into the fog that always hung over the city. They did this 239 times over a span of seven days. Hospitals were stunned to find a bacteria so rare infecting so many of their patients.\n\n\nThis was one of the many biowarfare agents tested on civilians. Soon the Americans used them in field by using bioweapons in Vietnam war, the Korean war and even infecting thousands in Cuba during the cold war.\n\n\nMany tests were disguised as healthcare programs. The most infamous one where they purposely injected Syphilis into the African American population to see the effects of the disease. The blacks were not informed that they were being injected with a disease. Millions were infected, hundreds probably died.\n\n\nThe USA is not the only country to test bioweapons on civilians. The UK conducted over 100 covert experiments in a span of 30 years on British citizens. They flew military planes dropping bacteria that was manipulated to produce the effects of anthrax infection.\n\n\nRussia also has taken part in biowarfare testing but the nature of its authoritarian government means no secret files are declassified.\n\n\n\n##The hilariously simple delivery systems for the bioweapons -\n\nIf you think that most of the bioweapons will be dropped from airplanes like bombs, you couldn't be any farther from the truth.\n\n\nDelivery systems are ridiculously simple. Take the sonepat example. All they have to do is release infected mosquitoes. The bloodsuckers will multiply and fly across the land to do their jobs.\n\n\nIn another experiment, the USA government filled glass bulbs of bioweapons and smashed them on the tracks of a subway system. The air circulation spread the pathogen across the whole subway system and infected millions.\n\n\nIn the Korean war, the USA used ticks as a vector and successfully infected millions of North Korean population.\n\n\n##How India stands vulnerable - \n\n\nIndia's sanitation and cleanliness program is still in a nascent stage.\n\n\nLarge cities with dense population clusters provide a clear vector for contagious diseases.\n\n\nA lack of a dedicated civilian or military disease fighting organisation is absent. The closest it has is the National Institute of Virology in Pune.\n\n\n##Steps India needs to take -\n\nIt is commendable that India does not have a biowarfare program to develop bioweapons.  But a biowarfare defence system is absolutely needed.\n\n\nRecent reports point to the fact that the Coronavirus was a lab generated bioweapon leaked in Wuhan. If this is the case then it caught every country unawares.\n\n\nIt has wrecked havoc in India, despite good government response. \n\n\nThe prime minister and the home minister both have been infected. Keeping politics aside for a moment, even Rahul Gandhi and many Congress leaders in the opposition have been infected. If this was a lethal bioattack, it would have crippled the government.\n\n\nThe government needs to bring in a doctrine to deal with bioweapons akin to the ones they already have in relation to nuclear and chemical warfare.\n\n\nThe government needs to form a organisation, military and civilian that is dedicated to recognize biological threats, isolate it, sequence it and synthesize a vaccine for it. \n\n\nWe already have many of the systems in place. We have premier medical colleges in AIIMS and AFMC, that can train doctors. We have vaccination producers in SII and Bharat Biotech that can produce vaccines in large numbers. Just the organisation in between them is missing.\n\n\nBiowarfare like Covid-19 is the next generation in the field of asymmetric warfare. Our nuclear preparedness has been tested, so has our power grid system, and our economic robustness. But all of them fail if a successful attack takes place in India.\n\n\nWe need a biowarfare defence policy now.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nNamaste.\n\nP.S. -\n\nA bioweapon is not targeted at just people. At the height of the cold war, the USA reared disease spreading pests that included locusts that it planned to release in USSR that would have destroyed the wheat harvest in the Soviet country, effectively causing a man made famine and winning the war.\n\n\n\nSources -\n\nProject Seaspray -\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/military-government-secret-experiments-biological-chemical-weapons-2016-9?IR=T\n\nHistory of germ warfare -\n\nhttps://idsa.in/cbwmagazine/StateActorsandGermWarfare_aroul\n\n\nProject 112 -\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-us-has-a-history-of-testing-biological-weapons-on-the-public-were-infected-ticks-used-too-120638\n\n\nThe Indian experiment -\n\nhttps://idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/DengueAGermwithWeaponPotential_ALele_191006 \n\n\n\nRussian and USA biowarfare programs using CrispR - \n\nhttps://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/synthetic-biology/Synthetic-biology-enable-bioweapons-development/96/i26\n\n\nA prophetic article - \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-biological-weaons-commentary-idUSKBN17L1SZ\n\n\nHeart attack weapon manufactured by the CIA -\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BSEnurBApdM\n\n\n\nGerm tests in the UK -\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience\n\n\n\nBayer drug that increases the chance to transmit AIDS -\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html\n\n\nInjecting syphillis into African Americans -\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study\n\n\nChina weaponises virus -\n\nhttps://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/leaked-chinese-document-reveals-a-sinister-plan-to-unleash-coronaviruses/news-story/53674e8108ad5a655e07e990daa85465"<br />Author: 'AsliIndianErotica'  id: 'noutr3'<br />Score:390<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/noutr3/india_desperately_needs_a_biowarfare_defence/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Death Rattle'<br />Body: 'HR: 114\nBP: 80 systolic \nOxygen saturation: 2% (yes, TWO) \n\nThe man is sprawled out on an ambulance gurney. He is 33 years old, and about to die. \nHe is rushed to the resuscitation bay. IV access is secured. The ER team feverishly prepares to intubate. A procedure that is all about getting control, threatens to spiral into chaos. Functioning in PPE suits is not easy- it’s hot, and restrictive. Sweat pours down your face and into your eyes. Vision is blurred. Nothing that you have ever trained for prepares you for this. Meanwhile the patient is rapidly entering his final moments. \nWatching a person die is nothing like they show you in the movies. There is no meaningful glance, no poignant last words, no symbolic tear. Once the drive to live is overwhelmed, a dying man settles into a sort of rhythmic gasping which becomes increasingly feeble. You may even hear the secretions pool in their throat, over the beeping monitors. This is a sight we instantly recognise and dread. It’s difficult to tell at which point exactly they’ve crossed the proverbial veil. Some we allow to pass in peace, having exhausted all options. Others, we hold open the jaws of death for, to try and reach in and pull them back out. Sometimes it works. More often, we fail. \n\nCut back to the resus-bay, where things have gotten increasingly frantic. One doctor wrestles with the laryngoscope with partial visibility (that fucking sweat!) - against all odds, he manages to place the endotracheal tube. The other calls out instructions to the nurse and EMT assisting, when a sick feeling hits him in the pit of his stomach - they’ve lost the pulse! Now the call that no one wanted to hear - ‘CPR!!!’\nThey start chest compressions - an exhausting exertion on the best of days. In PPE, you feel like you’re about to arrest by compression 20. No matter, only another 180 left. \nThey bring the patient back after 2 cycles. The ventilator is adjusted. Infusions are titrated. Miraculously, the man actually starts moving, so they have to sedate and paralyse him. Not brain-dead. Not bad for a guy who was clinically dead for 4 minutes, and mind bogglingly hypoxic for God-knows how long before. \nEven more miraculously, they actually have an ICU bed to admit him to. And this, brings me to my point. \nCOVID-19 has hit home. And it has hit with the kind of ferocity that collapsed the healthcare systems of world leaders. Our fragile (you would not be wrong in saying nonexistent) system folded in under a month. Lockdown was a chance to prepare - test aggressively, trace contacts, screen travellers, shore up hospitals (doctors, nurses, equipment). Our Governments did precisely none of these. 3 months and a litany of humanitarian crises later, we are right where we started - with our heads in the sand. Those migrant labourers starved and endured unending horror, for nothing. \nThe keyword being pandered about is ‘Unlock’. People seem to think the pandemic is over, and things can return to ‘normal’. Some seem to think the day they reopened the bars, the virus just up and left. \nAbsolutely fucking not.\nShit has well and truly hit the fan. These few months have been an absolute nightmare. A nightmare that has laid bare every little deficiency in this country’s healthcare infrastructure. A system that could not even cope with regular numbers in peacetime. \nI don’t care how robust you think your immune system is. And neither does COVID. It can very easily fuck you up, if you’re unlucky enough. You’re most welcome to play the odds. God knows, no one will stop you from doing your best to rid us of your stupidity. But your family and loved ones will have to cart you around the city, begging one hospital after another to take you in. Nearly all will turn you away - either for a genuine lack of beds, a fear of taking in a COVID patient, or by quoting prices that sound suspiciously like profiteering. WE ARE OVERWHELMED. Each time we stand at the entrance and tell a desperate family that we have no beds to take in their sick loved one, rips away a piece of our soul. Each time we have to turn away a begging family, a little part of us dies inside. None of us can escape being tainted by this. \nNot even death is a release - mortuaries are full of bodies awaiting a swab report before they can be interred. Things are coming to a head. \nAnd this is why we are begging. Pleading on our goddamn knees. STAY AT HOME. Lockdown or not, curfew or not - keep yourselves safe. Wear a mask. Stay at home. \nWith the second wave receding, the third wave is almost ready to knock at the door. The worst is yet to come, and we are hilariously under-equipped to deal with it.'<br />Author: 'Lanky-Cod2224'  id: 'noqxxt'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/noqxxt/death_rattle/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Should India just purchase Chinese vaccines for the short-term?'<br />Body: "The reason why I'm suggesting this is because Chinese companies were the first to come out with vaccines, almost 7 months after the break of the pandemic. Till date, they have vaccinated up to 620 million of their population. Even if you are skeptical of the data, half that number is still higher than what's achieved in India. \n\nIf Indians can put their emotions on geopolitical disputes aside, then they'd find that it makes logical sense to purchase Chinese vaccines than anywhere else outside India because 1) They are used to producing large numbers, hence then 620 million vaccinated figure, 2) Their efficacy is similar to Covaxin, because they also use dead viruses to activate human antibody and 3) They're much much cheaper than those made in US or UK. \n\nThe reality, of course, is that there's 0% chance of this happening. Which is unfortunate because Indians are only shooting their own foot by not keeping all options on the table."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'noijjv'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/noijjv/should_india_just_purchase_chinese_vaccines_for/</li>

However, my friends are advising me to take a counsellor, as it is apparently really helpful. So I did a bit of reading about counselling and learned they a) Help you pick colleges, which I don't really need since I've already completed my search B) Tutor you for SAT which again I don't need c) Help your application stand out. This is the part I'm worried about, i've got solid amount of extraculcs, marks and ability to write essays is there, but I'm worried that I'll miss out on the intricacies of the application process and not be able to make my application shine in the way a counsellor would. Now the caveat is most of the articles I found are by counselling organisations themselves so they obviously have a vested interest in making themselves look good. Now expense is another factor as well, college counsellors are expensive and my family doesn't a mountain of cash lying around.

Though its a very minor incident and very few people paid attention, it reflects a deep seated psyche and the clash of two conflicting and emerging ideologies in our country these days.\n\nThe show was about to end and the song being sung was [East or West, "Yo", India is the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqKMQeTNLT0) from an old Salman Khan starrer named "Judwa" and originally sung by Anu Malik himself. The first two lines of this song are:\n\n    East or West.\n    Yo, India is the best.\n\nBut as soon he sang the first line and the audience was about to complete the second, he abruptly stopped them and changed the jingle to *"Girls are the best"*.\n\nAnd here comes that uncomfortable and political clash of civilization going on these days! This reflects the deep seated mindset of all liberals like Anu Malik, they are ashamed to call India great these days just because there is a Saffron govt. in the center. To a sane or rational mind, this sounds utterly idiotic, but here we are. Why did Anu Malik and liberals like him never felt proud of our country when there was a Green (Congress) government at the time the movie had come?

Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share and discuss stories that you found in the chat. Here are some top stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top stories\n\n1. [Belarus dramatically hijacks plane to arrest journalist](https://apnews.com/article/belarus-europe-arrests-business-government-and-politics-45902c1cb40fd177461016b47824967f)\n\nIn one of the most dramatic events in civil aviation, a Ryanair flight flying from Athens to Vilnius, essentially a domestic flight within the EU\'s open domestic borders, was forced to land in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is not a member of the EU. The plane carrying opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich was initially warned of a bomb threat by Belarusian air traffic officials, but quickly found itself \'escorted\' by a pair of MiG-29\'s. Once landed, the journalist, his girlfriend, and a pair of people assumed to be Belarusian spies were removed and the flight allowed to continue. EU officials have blamed Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko (the country\'s first and only post-Soviet leader) and called it a state-sponsored hijack. European flights now avoid Belarusian airspace, while many Belarusian flights have been banned from using European airspace.\n\n2. [DRC volcanic eruption creates earthquakes](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/29/africa/drc-earthquakes-volcano-eruption-intl/index.html)\n\nIn yet more misery for the world, the Mt. Nyiragongo volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa erupted, spewing lava and ash and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, in addition to killing at least 31 people. Since the eruption, the volcanic crater has been experiencing collapse, causing several earthquakes, including 61 in a single day. Magma continues to move through fissures, emitting dangerous gases and contaminating water sources. Further eruptions are possible.\n\n3. [Mass grave of native children discovered in Canada](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/05/29/mass-grave-215-bodies-found-indigenous-school-canada/5262768001/)\n\nIn a discovery that harks back to Canada\'s dark past, a mass grave consisting of the remains of over 200 children was discovered underneath the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, Canada. The school was established in the late 1800s as part of Canada\'s genocidal policy of forcefully taking native children away from their parents into boarding schools, where they were converted to Christianity, forced to give up their mother tongues, and sexually abused. The policy only ended in 1970, by when over 1.5 lakh children has been subjected to it. Canada\'s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established after the country officially apologized for the policy, records 51 deaths in this school alone, so the new discovery adds quadruple that number.\n\n4. [Lab leak theory of COVID-19 back into limelight](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/biden-orders-us-intelligence-to-intensify-investigation-into-covid-19-origins.html)\n\nAfter a thoroughly botched up WHO-led investigation into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, many scientists and US intelligence officials are revisiting the formerly discredited theory that the virus leaked out from a lab in Wuhan, China. Many journalists have also been criticized for their knee-jerk reaction of dismissing the possibility just because it was floated by former US President Donald Trump. Now, current US President Joe Biden has ordered his intelligence agencies to investigate the possibility, a move that was condemned by China, which simultaneously insists that the virus was natural *and* came out of a US Army lab.\n\n5. [COVID-19 cases rise in Japan ahead of Olympic games](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/05/29/national/japan-coronavirus-may-29/)\n\nCases of COVID-19 continued to rise in Japan, with Tokyo, Osaka, and Hokkaido reporting hundreds of new cases in a single day. Media reports have indicated that hospital beds are becoming scarce in Osaka, although that\'s in part to the extremely conservative culture resisting the idea of using field hospitals or general physicians for COVID-19 treatment. However, this increase comes barely two months before the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics, where tourists have already been banned. The Games now require participants to waive the organizers\' liability for COVID-19. Polls have shown that a majority of Japanese citizens want the games to be cancelled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The maverick Nicolae Ceaușescu\n\n*This post is the first of a new three-post series on the three \'independent\' Communist Eastern European countries: Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia*\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was in the news this week for ordering the hijacking of a plane to arrest a dissident journalist. Lukashenko is one of the last leftover products of Eastern European Communist dictators, a breed that once tightly controlled the lives of millions in the name of a deadly ideology. While we tend to think of all of Eastern Europe as being part of the Soviet empire, there were actually some notable exceptions -  Romania being one of them, a small Eastern European country that initially allied itself to Nazi Germany, only to be overrun by the Red Army and become a Communist country. Ceaușescu (pronounced ko-ches-kyu) came up through this system, but he had ideas of his own.\n\nBorn in 1918 to a poor Romanian family, young Nicolae soon left an abusive home to earn a living as a teenager. Working in odd jobs, he came into contact with the Communist Party, a banned organization at the time (after the Russian Revolution, many European countries moved to ban Communist parties for fear of similar revolutions at home). He participated in several banned activities - although they were mostly organizing workers - and faced several rounds of arrest all the way through the inter-war period. During WW2, as Romania joined the Axis powers, political prisoners including Ceaușescu were transferred to detention camps, where he met Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and formed an alliance that would determine the country\'s history for the rest of the century. Gheorghiu-Dej was a Communist ideologue with a personality cult: he insisted that everyone at the camp learn his interpretation of Marx, Lenin, and Engels, and Ceaușescu was his enforcer. Such is the politics of prison.\n\nAfter WW2, the Soviet Union occupied Romania and held sham elections where the Communist Party won 85% of the vote and then banned all other parties. Gheorghiu-Dej became the General Secretary and the de facto head of the country, and promoted his ally Ceaușescu to several prominent positions in government. This period was a struggle between Communists that were based in Romania (including the two men) and those that lived in Moscow but wanted to control the country. In most Eastern Bloc countries, the latter prevailed - in Romania, the former prevailed, thus giving the country a measure of autonomy.\n\nIn 1965, Gheorghiu-Dej died and was succeeded by Ceaușescu. He was initially popular, openly defying the Soviets by establishing relations with West Germany (which the USSR did not recognize), refusing to participate in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, entering into various US-led trade agreements, establishing relations with Israel, and even joining the IMF. But eventually, Ceaușescu\'s arbitrary ideas began to take hold. He believed that a high population was the key to economic growth, and thus banned all abortions and contraceptives as well as penalized divorce, leading to a huge spike in the number of abandoned babies. Women who had at least 10 children were declared "Heroine mothers" by the state, but few chose that dubious honour. In 1971, he visited fellow Communist states China, North Korea, and Vietnam, and found great inspiration in the personality cults of Mao and Kim Il-Sung. Indeed, he was so inspired by Mao that he proceeded to launch his own cultural revolution at home, punishing those deemed ideologically impure and replacing professionals with agitators.\n\nAnd thus the cult of Ceaușescu began. He replaced the Communist system wherein the State Council ruled, with a personal dictatorship where he and only he made all decisions. He created a "presidential scepter" - a symbol reminiscent of monarchies, ordered the state media to only use his picture at age 40, and never disclose his true height (5\'6"). In the 1980s, oil prices surged and Romania, as a major oil producer, saw windfall profits. However, instead of investing them in the country, Ceaușescu largely donated them to third world countries to raise his own image. But he did intend to use oil profits to bolster the country - he proceeded to take out huge loans from Western banks to build new refineries, betting that oil prices would stay high forever and would enable the country to repay those loans. This proved to be his downfall - oil prices collapsed, and his country was left with huge debts. In an attempt to pay them off without going with a begging bowl to Moscow, he established extreme austerity measures that further shrunk the economy, although it was successful in repaying all the debt. Widespread anger was quashed by the military and the secret police, although most Western countries did not condemn it for fearing of turning away one of their few friends in the Eastern Bloc.\n\nSeeing a danger to his rule, Ceaușescu held a rally in Bucharest where he announced new welfare measures, but in a rare revolt in a Communist state, the crowd began to boo and jeer at him, even pelting stones, forcing him to flee the rally. He had hoped that the Army would restore order, but he had become so unpopular that the Army was also in open revolt, although loyal factions killed about 64,000 protesters in a few days. Nonetheless, Ceaușescu and his family were forced to flee, leading to a collapse of the Communist Party itself. He was captured by the army, subject to a quick show-trial, and was executed by a bullet through the back of his head. Ironically, he and his family were the last Romanians to be executed before the new, democratic government banned the practice in 1990.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?

      <li>Title::: 'If the Indian govt spent heavily on vaccines and the new wave did not happen, will Indians approve of it?'<br />Body: "It's always easy to blame after a certain bad event has happened, like how people always do in India. This doesn't work, because you are always reactive instead of proactive, you try to solve a problem after it has happened. Sure, you prevent the problem from getting bigger, but by then there's too much loss.\n\nThink about the alternative to what has just happened. In our alternative world, the new wave did not happen. The government of India spent excessively on vaccination efforts and raked up so much debt in the process (you need to understand that vaccinating even 600 million people quickly is extremely expensive, US only managed 120 million so far). This debt comes back to haunt India in the form of an economic crisis years after the pandemic, like what happened in 2013. \n\nGovernment also allowed states/private firms to purchase their own vaccines with very relaxed regulations. After that, there were numerous reports in media about dangerous side-effects in some individuals who got specific vaccines. The whole thing gets blown out of proportion where government and the Indian regulatory agency receives a lot of flak from people for not regulating properly. There will also be many who criticize govt for going against their 'Make In India' motto. \n\nLet's also not be naive into thinking that there is any leader in this world who puts people above politics. All politicians say this but all of them think about their political survival. The good politician is the one who won't survive because his policy prevented a terrible event from happening, but no one knows about it, everyone focuses on how foolish he was to spend so much money to stop something from happening."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'no7ewn'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/no7ewn/if_the_indian_govt_spent_heavily_on_vaccines_and/</li>

      <li>Title::: "The cruel hand fate dealt Shivaji, how he struggled to establish Swarajya and how it mirrors the difficulties we face in today's politics."<br />Body: 'Shiva was born to Jijabai Bhonsale at the beginning of the 17th century. His father abandoned his mother before Shiva was born. He abandoned Shiva\'s mother for a younger and more beautiful woman and appointed a person named Dadaji Kondke as a caretaker for his wife and son.\n\n\nShiva grew up without a father, but that only stoked the fire to prove himself even more. He, along with his friends of his age, roamed the Western ghats. For people unacquainted with the terrain, please come to the ghats for a trek. The terrain is unforgiving even today. Back in Shiva\'s time the land had no roads and was full of treacherous ground and thick evergreen jungles. Shiva and his friends honed their physical and military prowess by ranging these lands for months at a go. This made them intimate with the bhumi and will pay handsome dividends in the future.\n\n\nJijabai, abandoned by her husband, took to a different kind of study. She became deeply religious and took to the holy books. She made sure to impart this education to Shiva. And by the time he was a teenager, Shiva\'s favourite books were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Taking lessons from yesterage kings Shivaji dreamed of a perfect kingdom for himself.\n\n\nBeing a free soul at heart and steeped into dharma, he wanted to carve out a kingdom for himself and his own people. The seeds of swarajya were sown.\n\n\n\n##Shivaji discouraged from thinking about swarajya-\n\n\n\nShiva\'s caretaker Dadaji discouraged him from taking a stand and capturing enemy territory. Shiva\'s father and ancestors were all vassals - subservient to a master, usually a Bijapuri king. Most Marathas carved out a living like this. Back in the day Maharashtra was not the prosperous land we know today. The land was harsh and the monsoons unforgiving in the west. The east was a dry land where few crops grew. Hence it was convinient for most Marathas to enter Bijapuri or Mughal service.\n\n\nShiva was also recommended the same. But he rejected the advice and stayed truthful to his vision of uniting his land under a ruler who was not born of a foreign invader.\n\n\nThe advice was not ill by all means. The Mughals were a formidable force and so were the Bijapuris. They could rout the Marathas if they wanted. They had the strength of hundreds of thousands of men and the wealth to support them anywhere in India. \n\n\nThe only advantages Shivaji had were the terrain of Deccan plateau and the rift between Adil Shah and the Mughals in Agra. And using this advantages, he started building forts and capturing Mughal forts.\n\n\n\n##Shivaji meets his first challenge in Afzal Khan -\n\n\n\nAdil Shah of Bijapur sent Afzal Khan to deal with Shiva.\n\n\nThe day before Afzal Khan was supposed to leave Bijapur he had a divine premonition that his campaign would fail and he would die for it.\n\n\nBecause he could not even entertain the thought that his 63 wives would continue to live without his stead, he did what was expected of an Islamic ruler. He put them to the sword personally.\n\n\n**He butchered all of his 63 wives in a pile of bodies and then started on his campaign.**\n\n\nHis host was a large one. Shivaji was shrewd enough to know that he could not face them head on. So he retreated and waited for the right moment to strike. Afzal khan grew impatient, and used the classic tactic used by Islamic invaders to draw Shivaji out.\n\n\n**At Tuljapur, Afzal khan destroyed the murti of the goddess Bhavani**, the goddess of all Marathas. After he broke the murti, he ground up the pieces into fine powder in the nearby stone mill. Shivaji waited and Afzal desecrated and destroyed every temple and its deity until he reached pratapgarh.\n\n\nShivaji was smart and he sued for peace ( a feign). Afzal invited him over to his camp but Shiva refused and asked Afzal to meet at Pratapgarh. Afzal agreed and the two met at the summit with just their bodyguards. Afzal\'s host, numbering 10,000 camped under the fort while Shivaji\'s host half the number was hidden in the forest around the camp waiting for orders.\n\n\nThe rest is a legend where Afzal Khan held Shiva in a bear hug to kill him, but failed when his dagger was stopped by the chainmail Shiva wore under his robes. Shiva took out his bichwa and his Bagh nakh and slew Afzal who was a foot taller than him and spilled his guts.\n\n\nHis smaller army then slew the entire host of Afzal even though they were at a numerical disadvantage. \n\n\n\n##Shaista Khan embarrassed by Shivaji -\n\n\n\nShaista khan was sent by Aurangzeb to deal with Shiva. Shiva was now learned in guerilla warfare and did not meet him in the field. Instead he kept Shaista Khan thinking that Shivaji was shrinking from a fight.\n\n\nThen one fine night he infiltrated the very camp of Shaista and his own personal tent where he lay with his whores. Shivaji stood on his bed ready to chop Shaista\'s head off when one of the whores put out the diyas in the tent. \n\n\nShaista Khan lost a thumb but also his will to live and ran off to Agra to the anger of Aurangzeb.\n\n\n\n##The defeat of Shivaji at the hands of Jai Singh -\n\n\n\nJai Singh was a Hindu Rajput general who served under Aurangzeb and was considered to be his finest. Aurangzeb sent him to Deccan to do away with Shivaji.\n\n\nJai Singh wasted no time. He took 27 of Shivaji\'s forts one by one using all his military acumen and commanding sieges personally.\n\n\nShivaji knew he was at a tremendous disadvantage. If he continued to resist he will be wiped out. And so he sued for peace again. Jai Singh agreed and the two drew out terms of peace.\n\n\nJai Singh then somehow convinced Shiva to visit Aurangzeb in Agra. At first Shivaji was hesitant, not trusting Aurangzeb\'s intentions. But then he relented, realising his position.\n\n\nAt Agra, in Aurangzeb\'s court, Shivaji was humiliated by the king. And later when he protested his treatment he was imprisoned for 3 months.\n\n\nBut using all his mental capacities, he escaped the capital under the emperor\'s nose and reached his home taking a Hindu pilgrimage through Banaras, Mathura, Puri and then finally home. \n\n\nJai Singh\'s position was compromised after Shivaji\'s escape as he was the one who brokered it. He tried to even use deceit by offering to marry his son to Shivaji\'s daughter. It was deceit because he considered Shivaji\'s caste to be untouchable, and considered Shiva\'s daughter to be lower than the whores in his harem. Unsuccessful at last, after Shivaji did not bite the bait, he died on his way back to Rajasthan.\n\n\n\n##Shivaji decides to coronate himself as king but even here he faces debacles -\n\nShiva was born a Bhonsale. Bhonsales are land tillers, not warriors and hence shudras. Shivaji was a laughing stock of Marathas who were above his caste. So he reached out to the brahmins to coronate him in the appropriate rites and rituals.\n\n\nRecognizing the need for a Hindu Chhatrapati, they complied and made him a king. \n\n\nShivaji\'s life after the coronation was struggle until death. He captured many forts and even expanded his rule to the south until Karnataka. \n\n\nHe fought the Bijapuris and the Mughals and the English and built a formidable army and navy.\n\n\nBut in the end he was thwarted by his own people. How many enemies could he fight at the same time?\n\n\n\n##Not much has changed today -\n\n\n\nInstead of sieging forts, the separatists send their people to [siege the capital](https://www.opindia.com/2020/02/shaheen-bagh-protests-truth-opindia-ground-report/) by blocking arterial highways and roads. These sieges under the [garb of protests](https://www.opindia.com/2020/12/farmers-protest-gym-langar-pizza-making-massage-parlour-khalistanis/) last for years and cost crores of rupees in financial losses.\n\n\nInstead of capturing forts and butchering the nearby villagers the separatists now win elections capturing the state and [butcher BJP workers](https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/bengal-violence-1-lakh-people-fled-suvendu-adhikari/) after their win.\n\n\nInstead of Jai Singh, there are a number of [leaders](https://m.republicworld.com/india-news/politics/rahul-gandhi-fearmongers-over-covid-vaccine-price-slams-centre-on-grant-to-bharat-biotech.html) who pretend to be Indian and conspire with foreign forces to break India. Just like Jai Singh they are capable and cunning and won\'t hesitate to break India for the imperialists.\n\n\nInstead of breaking murtis of our deities they [defend ](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-mosque-against-waqf-act-illegal-under-shariyat-law-aimplb/story-0QrFb4aJkLrQA8HwjzkceJ.html#:~:text=All%20India%20Muslim%20Personal%20Law,illegal%E2%80%9D%20under%20the%20Shariat%20laws.&amp;text=The%20proposed%20mosque%20in%20Ayodhya%20violates%20the%20Act.,-It%20violates%20the) the religious structures that they built over destroyed temples.\n\n\nInstead of jizya, they [control our temples](https://www.firstpost.com/india/why-indias-temples-must-be-freed-from-government-control-9460381.html) and loot them how they want to. No tax is levied or control pressed on other religions places of worship. Dhimmis still exist.\n\n\nIt took us 700 years to take ONE place of worship back. 7 bloody centuries to right ONE wrong. How many razed temples lay buried under? How many wrongs are yet to be righted?\n\n\nIt took 70 years to start giving the rural areas a true right to water, electricity, houses and sanitation. The policy of sanitation and cleanliness was laughed at by the imperialist prince for being a national policy.\n\n\nFor the first time we have a leader who is Bharatiya, who thinks of swarajya in the true sense. For the first time we have a leader who will unite us in the true sense and take us into the future. And with him stand people who want to achieve that dream with him.\n\n\nJust like Shivaji, he also is a deeply religious Hindu. And despite being deeply religious, he is not bigoted. He believes in progress for all people. Like Shivaji, he also had to prove his worth, being of a "lower caste". But in the end, how the Marathis accepted the "shudra" Shivaji, the Sangh put aside caste differences for the good of the people and let him lead India.\n\n\nThe Jana Sangh will always stand for swarajya. Win or lose, it does not matter. Like Jijamata\'s teaching the Sangh stands grounded in dharma, to fight for the well being of its people. No number of separatists and imperialists can break Bharat as long as the Sangh stands.\n\n\nThe age of looting our people, breaking Bharat, our murtis and our temples is over. Swarajya will be established.\n\n\nJaya Bhavani!'<br />Author: 'AsliIndianErotica'  id: 'no5v1r'<br />Score:74<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/no5v1r/the_cruel_hand_fate_dealt_shivaji_how_he/</li>

And I get that. She said life is not treating her well right now.\n\nI do believe postive days will help, but I think I realised something and here it goes-\nImagine life is like a [Newton's disk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_disc). Now as Newton's disk has seven colors of rainbow, similarly life has various kinds of days, some good and some bad. Though these days are not rigid as the seven colors of rainbow, and the types of days may vary at different times of your life. Now, as the life goes on we can think of it to be analogous to when Newton's disk is moving. So as Newton's disk appears white when it's moving, even though it has 7 different colors, similarly, as life goes on we see life usually as a single color, i.e., say sad, happy, neutral, etc. Even though your life would consist of various events, happy, sad, etc, but when you look at life as a whole (mostly short term) it would appear as a single color than as individual constituents or as individual events that may have happened. This color is also not rigid as Newton's disk is always white, but at different times of your life, the color of your life would be different. \n\nWhat I mean is, life always has different things to offer, but we usually look at life a bit generally and say as a culmination of what's been happening recently rather than analysing life event by event. Hence life may appear too sad sometimes but it's not always so. ( I in no means am trying to say that there's always something good).\n\nI think we see life as a single color when it's actually multiple colors representing multiple things.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"<br />Author: '____-p-c-____'  id: 'no50r7'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/no50r7/newtons_disk_analogy_of_life/</li>

Why leave out the Jains/Buddhists or even the Muslims who might want to adopt a Dharmic way of life? The aim of an ecosystem must be having maximum number of decent people in its fold, a larger and inclusive ecosystem thrives better.\n\nSecondly, it may appear contrarian or even unpopular to some, but is it right to tie a cultural ecosystem to politics in such a direct manner? Though they are based on Hindutva ideology, BJP is a political party and has its own interests (one of them being staying in power or strengthening the establishment). I don\'t think a BJP MP like Kapil Mishra should lead a Hindu Ecosystem, it should be someone non-political who cares for the Hindu civilization first.

      <li>Title::: 'The Story of Indian Edible Oil'<br />Body: '**Highlights**\n\n*  *India imports edible oil worth nearly Rs 65,000-70,000 crore annually* \n*  *If farmers get the* *Minimum Support Price* *(MSP) for oilseeds and high yield seeds are available then their interest in cultivating these crops would increase.*  \n*  *Deliberate sabotage to discredit indigenous and loose oils and promote  imports was done in 1990s*\n\n# How much have edible oil prices risen?\n\nThe prices of six edible oils — groundnut oil, mustard oil, vanaspati, soya oil, sunflower oil and palm oil — have risen between 20% and 56% at all-India levels in the last one year, data on the Department of Consumer Affairs website show. The retail price of mustard oil (packed) has increased by 44% to Rs 171 per kg on May 28 this year, from Rs 118 per kg on the same date last year. The prices of soya oil and sunflower oil, too, have increased more than 50% since last year. (See graphic)\n\nIn fact, the monthly average retail prices of all six edible oils soared to an 11-year high in May 2021. \n\n# How much edible oil does India consume?\n\n*According to the latest data, each Indian consumed 19.5 kg of edible  oil every year on an average during 2015-16, up from 15.8 kg in 2012-13.  This amounts to an aggregate demand of around 26 million tons of edible  oils per year.*\n\nMustard oil is consumed mostly in rural areas, the share of refined oils —sunflower oil and soyabean oil — is higher in urban areas.\n\nBetween 1993-94 and 2004-05, monthly per capita consumption of edible oils increased from 0.37 kg to 0.48 kg in rural areas, and from 0.56 kg to 0.66 kg in urban areas. By 2011-12, it had risen further to 0.67 kg in rural areas and 0.85 kg in urban areas.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, the per capita availability of vegetable oils in the country has been in the range of 19.10 kg to 19.80 kg per annum during the last five years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyhi9qyl91271.png?width=1078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=847de42fda29eb73ead08b5939d14d8ae86d1c41\n\n# How much is produced domestically and how much is imported?\n\nAccording to the Agriculture Ministry, the demand for vegetable oils has been in the range of 23.48–25.92 million tonnes between 2015-16 and 2019-20. However, domestic supply in this period has been much lower, in the range of 8.63–10.65 million tonnes.\n\nIn 2019-20, domestic availability of edible oils from both primary sources (oilseeds like mustard, groundnut etc.) and secondary sources (such as coconut, oil palm, rice bran oil, cotton seed) was only 10.65 million tonnes against the total domestic demand of 24 million tonnes — a gap of over 13 million tonnes.\n\nThus, India depends on imports to meet its demand. In 2019-20, the country imported about 13.35 million tonnes of edible oils worth Rs 61,559 crore, or about 56% of the demand. This mainly comprised palm (7 million tonnes), soyabean (3.5 millon tonnes) and sunflower (2.5 million tonnes). The major sources of these imports are Argentina and Brazil for soyabeen oil; Indonesia and Malaysia palm oil; and Ukraine and Argentina again for sunflower oil.\n\nThis self-sufficiency continued till the Narsimha Rao government  signed the WTO agreement in 1994 and edible oil was put under OGL (Open  General License) with 65% duty. By 1998 we were again importing around [30% of our edible oil](http://www.taas.in/documents/pub-sp-06.pdf). We could never foresee then, what was in store in the near future.\n\n#  Cultivation domesitcally\n\nIndia cultivated oilseeds on 25 million hectare of land, producing 32  million tons of oilseeds in 2018-19, with soybean, rapeseed and mustard  and groundnut accounting for almost 90 per cent share in the area.\n\nAssuming a country-wide average of 28 per cent oil recovery, 32  million tons of oilseeds will yield around 8.4 million tons of edible  oil. The domestic production can only meet a little over 30 per cent of  the total demand for edible oils, necessitating its import.\n\n#  Role of Dhara Oil, remember the old ad \n\nIn 1977, the then finance minister, H.M. Patel\xa0 suggested to Dr  Verghese Kurien an “Operation Flood” like project for edible oils via a  farmers cooperative network based on the Amul model. The objective was  self-reliance in edible oils through increased productivity\n\nThe project was named Operation Golden Flow. Central to the operation  was the brand ‘Dhara’, which was created to build a market for the  Indian oilseed grower. It was inspired by the wordmark of Dalda in green  on a yellow background, the leader in vanaspati. This was a part of the  market intervention operation. Dhara was launched in Delhi on August  23, 1988. Dhara pricing was kept low due to economies of scale and  blending with the donated oil from CLUSA (Cooperative League of the  USA), a strategy taken from the ‘pump priming’ of donated SMP and  butter-oil during Operation Flood.\n\nThus, Dhara brought prices of domestic oil at par with cheaper imported edible oil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yymlimt1c1271.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=627c6e8d6e980f28f45394b002dffdd82e2df952\n\n#  Deliberate sabotage to discredit indigenous and loose oils and promote  imports. \n\nUnder the Vajpayee government, the import duty on edible oil was  further reduced to 15% in July 1998 and coincidentally the Argemone  adulteration Dropsy case took place in August 1998. Sixty people died  and around [3,000 got sick in Delhi](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/oils-not-well-9084)  and caught the nation’s attention. All of a sudden, all domestic brands  selling mustard oil became outcasts and even loose mustard oil was  banned. NDDB had to release advertisements to inform consumers not to  buy its trusted Dhara Mustard Oil. Out of fear consumers shifted to  ‘purer’ aromaless, colourless, tasteless oils or solvent extracted  refined oils, as we know them. Over the next few years, that black swan  event, led to a shift in the socio-cultural cooking and consumption  patterns of edible oil in the country.\n\nIndustry followers [consider it](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/indias-colourless-revolution-replacement-of-traditional-oils-by-soy-and-palm-oils/)  deliberate sabotage to discredit indigenous and loose oils and promote  imports. Mustard oil contaminated with argemone (essentially weed seed  contamination) is an ancient occurrence, but adulteration is never more  than 1%. In these cases, adulteration was up to 30%, with argemone,  diesel and waste oil as contaminants. The adulteration was therefore  done in such a way that it would kill, and do so conspicuously and  rapidly. Thus, the tragedy was seemingly not a result of the normal  business of adulteration.\n\nAs the then Delhi health minister Harsh Vardhan stated, this is not possible without an organised [conspiracy](http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/09/development-india-officials-helpless-as-spurious-oil-kills-50/).\n\n# Why are prices rising?\n\nThe increase in domestic prices is basically a reflection of international prices, because India meets 56% of its domestic demand through imports. In the international market, prices of edible oils have jumped sharply in recent months due to various factors.\n\nAnother reason is the thrust on making biofuel from vegetable oil. There is a shifting of edible oils from food basket to fuel basket.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82388746d1271.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=011e6e76d58422e4fa3814b7979d0c5e9e6dc36e\n\n# How can government help farmers improve the yield per hectare \n\nIndia increase the area under oilseeds in India from 9 million tons  in 1986 to 32 million tons in 2018-19, though not sufficient to meet the  domestic demand.\n\n* Increase MSP minimum support prices of oilseed  crops\n* Improve quality of seeds\n* Optimum use of  agro-chemicals and better management.\n\n# Move away from rice cultivation, less water is needed too\n\nIndia has 11.7 mha of rice fallow, which can be  used for the cultivation of safflower and mustard crops, which don’t  need much water.\n\nAlternatives such as rice bran oil is gaining popularity amongst the  urban consumers, as it is known to reduce the risk of heart diseases and  type 2 diabetes. Rice bran constitutes about 8.5 per cent of the total  production of rice and has around 15 per cent content. Around 2 million  tons of edible oil can be produced using the available rice bran.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n[***https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/how-india-can-be-atmanirbhar-for-edible-oil-production-75517***](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/how-india-can-be-atmanirbhar-for-edible-oil-production-75517)\n\n[***https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms***](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/modi-govt-to-reduce-dependence-on-edible-oil-imports/articleshow/81135902.cms)\n\n[***https://theprint.in/features/dharas-jalebi-ad-from-the-1990s-still-means-home-and-family/421624/***](https://theprint.in/features/dharas-jalebi-ad-from-the-1990s-still-means-home-and-family/421624/)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'nnklcz'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nnklcz/the_story_of_indian_edible_oil/</li>

I'm trying to figure out a way to keep India united without oppressing anyone and this seems like the best way to do it. Essentially make all states in British India independent countries--and possibly restructure them along linguistic or religio-linguistic lines--while having all or at least most of them form an EU-like confederation. This confederation wouldn't actually have to be limited to British India--it could also extend to Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Indochina, the Philippines, Afghanistan (it can be won over by giving it the Pashtun-majority parts of British India in exchange for it agreeing to join this EU-like South Asian confederation), Iran, et cetera. In other words, have it be a giant South Asian + Southeast Asian equivalent of the European Union. Punjab and/or Bengal might or might not still get partitioned in this scenario, but either way, they will form their own separate countries--either one country or several countries--in this scenario.\n\nAnyway, what do you think about this idea?

      <li>Title::: 'Regarding the WhatsApp traceability'<br />Body: "Many people have been wondering if the government's going to be able to read our messages now that Whatsapp would have to agree to tracing messages of concern. I wanted to add my own opinion towards this issue as to why I think this should be a cause of concern for us. \n\nFirst, lemme talk a bit about the e2e encryption in WhatsApp. It's the same rsa algorithm which banks use to send otp's and by organizations to send encoded messages. The messages are encoded using 2 huge prime numbers (one secret key from each device and one public key) (100's of digits in each), so to decrypt one would need to know the secret key for the recipient which is theoretically impossible. One would have an easier time guessing the secret key. \n\nNow the I adress the issue at hand. According to the encryption system, no one except the sender and reciever can view the message. Only other exception is the parent app: WhatsApp, which can employ a spying system in place. So if the government did try to spy on our messages, then they'd have to take control over whatsapp and if they do get our messages then that'd mean that WhatsApp is actually keeping in place a spying system because there's no other way WhatsApp could keep a record of the actual messages that we sent. I believe this issue which WhatsApp raised actually shows how WhatsApp is keeping a record of our messages.\n\nSo as I've stated that no one can actually see our messages, now we wonder as to how whatsapp can provide the original location of a text sender. Simple, I believe that it can be done by locating the area from where a server request came for sending the concerned message. This system has actually been in place in Facebook and Twitter for a long time wherein people have been located through their posts/tweets. \n\nOne more flaw I'd like to address is that the gov will only be tracing messages which come under it's highlight. So a message would actually have to be mass forwarded and that message would have to be a part of a criminal plan. So it's not the case that our daily messages between peers is something that the government would trace and even if it did, they would have to go through the judiciary (which acts as an independent body).\n\nNow, I'll highly appreciate whatever you guys have to say and I'd like to have a proper discussion regarding this issue."<br />Author: 'absman00700'  id: 'nn5ruq'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nn5ruq/regarding_the_whatsapp_traceability/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Twitter Freedom of Speech controversy'<br />Body: 'The Indian government is said to have sent police officers to Twitter’s office to intimidate the staff of Twitter. The police claim that they simply came there to verify the facts behind the Sambhit Patra fake news tweet.\n\nTwitter is saying that the Indian government is trying to suppress freedom of speech by making Twitter liable by making it appoint a grievance officer. The Indian government says that this is a requirement according to the new IT laws to resolve controversies faster and to stop spreading misinformation.\n\nNow, I think that the government should have no right to dictate what tweets are to be censored (which has been complied before by Twitter) and which ones are to be left open. They should also be subject to fact checking, just like Sambhit Patra’s tweet was.\n\nBut here is where the problem arises. Twitter claims to be a platform that promotes freedom of speech. They claim that everyone has the fundamental rights, parroting our own constitution to us. Telling us what they think is right. If they are promoting free speech, why did they deplatform certain people, why did they delete certain tweets? It is not just pressure by the government, they also sometimes act according to their own political biases. Either don’t suppress/fact check anyone, or appoint a grievance officer if you’re doing so.\n\nTwitter cannot claim to be a proponent of free speech, and a platform who fact checks people without providing evidence or proof for the fact checking.\n\nThe solution according to the Indian government is to have a resident grievance officer. This person is supposed to resolve any conflicting information/fact checking. Twitter is alleging, that such a grievance officer might come under pressure from the government in case Twitter doesn’t comply with censorship. To this, I say that it is an act of cowardice from them. They are making money from the Indian populace, they should give back by fighting for our freedom of speech.\n\nThe solution is simple. Place multiple grievance officers in India, with one of them being the head. All of them will be responsible for fact checking. If they come under pressure from the police, they have CCTVs in the office. They can release it to the all the media houses in India. I’m sure these houses will more than oblige to talk about the censorship our government is enforcing. They can also add transparency to the fact checking by providing the sources for the fact checking.\n\nWhat I am saying is that Twitter is trying to play both sides according to whatever is convenient for them. They comply with the ruling party when it suits them, and then fact checks them when it suits them. They are a multibillion dollar global enterprise and are acting in their self interest. We shouldn’t give them the easy way out. We should find a middle ground so that the ruling parties won’t be able to take advantage of the grievance officers, and Twitter doesn’t get to censor whomever they see fit. Censorship works both ways, and we have a responsibility to fight for the freedom of speech, even if we don’t agree with that speech.'<br />Author: 'private_unlimited'  id: 'nmrte8'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nmrte8/twitter_freedom_of_speech_controversy/</li>

The recent studies on the genetics of R1a1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) in the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA studies have helped understand the migration pattern of Humans during the late Holocene (i.e. end of ice age) period better. Y chromosome is found only among males and so it is inherited only by the sons of the group and hence it gives valuable insight into the patrilineal gene flow and migrations. On the other hand mitochondrial DNA is exclusively derived from the mother of the child (as opposed to the DNA/Chromosomes in the nucleus, which is derived from both father and mother) and so it helps understand the pattern of matrilineal gene flow and migration better. In layman term, by tracing the Y chromosomes, one can trace the fathers and grand fathers of the individual/group while tracing the mitochondrial DNA would help trace the DNA of the mother and grand mothers of the group.\n\n[Lucotte G.](http://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-major-ychromosome-haplotype-xi--haplogroup-r1a-in-eurasia-2161-1041-1000150.pdf)\n\nis one such major study on genetics which studies the distribution pattern of R1a1 haplotype in detail among the Europeans, Central Asians and Indians. Since R1a1 is common between the above three groups of population, it is used by most studies to study migration patterns in Eurasia. The study looks for prevalence of R1a1 and the frequency of variation in the R1a1 haplotype. The principle behind this study is that, newer groups of people would have far lower variations among them while older population groups would have higher frequency of variations. In other words, older populations would be lot less homogeneous than the newer populations. This is how modern humans’ ancestry is traced back to Africans, because Africans have the highest amount of genetic variations among the different groups of people today.\n\n&gt;In the present study we have extended the field of detection of haplotype XI/haplogroup R1a subject to other countries previously uncovered in our preceding articles \\[9,10\\]: these countries are mainly Northern Europe, Georgia and Armenia, Near/Middle East, NorthAfrica, Iran and Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. We found high haplotype XI frequencies values in Afghanistan (18.4%), in Iran (26.5%), in Pakistan (28% and 30.4%) and in India; in this last subcontinent, the maximal value of 61.3% was found in Punjab. We have refound in our samples the clear distinction initially established by Pamjav et al. \\[21\\] between Indian Z93 populations and European Z280 populations: all our South Asian populations are Z93, while almost all our European populations are Z280. Datations show that the Z93 Pakistano-Indian group is the most ancient (about 15.5K years); in Europe, the Eastern populations are the most ancient (about 12.5K years) and the Northern ones the most recent (about 6.9K years).\n\nSo, the data from the study gives evidence that the R1a1 found in Punjab is the oldest while the central European haplotype is in the middle and Northern European R1a haplotype is the youngest. This pretty much buries the Aryan invasion/migration theories to the ground because if AIT/AMT was true, we would have seen from the genetic results that the Eastern European haplotype being the oldest and Indian haplotype being the youngest since AIT claims that Europeans (the parent population) came as invaders/migrants to North India as Aryans. It is also important to note the age of different population groups in the study. The study states that Central/Eastern European population is 12.5k years old while Northern Population is 6.9K years old. And the Punjabi/North Indian population is at least 15.5k years old.\n\nThe age component in these studies is the most important because as per Aryan Invasion/Migration theory, IVC was Dravidian and it ended because of Migration/Invasion by the Aryans around 1500 BC i.e. 4000 years ago. In the light of above mentioned and similar other genetic studies, the Aryan Invasion theory/Migration theory is off the mark by at least 10000 years. The significance of this fact is that it demolishes the argument of AIT peddlers who push the narrative that Hinduism is not native to India and came with the Aryan invaders. Since North Indian population is at least 15,000 years old, this claim falls flat on its face and make Hinduism indigenous to India and India alone.\n\n**The actual population composition of India**\n\nAs per the latest genetic studies, population of India is derived from two separate population groups ANI (ancestral North indians) and ASI (Ancestral South Indians). The data suggests that ANI came to India at around 60000 BC and ASI came to India at around 45000 BC. But without falling for the labels, the ANI and ASI are not synonymous with Aryans and Dravidians as some the AMT/AIT enthusiasts try to make it up. North Indians on average have about 60% ANI genes and 40% ASI genes while South Indians on average have 40% ANI genes and 60% ASI genes. The South and North Indian names for ASI and ANI are given out respectively to denote that they contributed to South Indians and North Indians respectively more and not as a distinct North Indian Aryan or South Indian Dravidian entity. This is also the reason why the South Indians also share genetic similarity with the Europeans. Since North Indians share 40% genetic material with South Indians, and Europeans share 60-70% genetic similarity with North Indians, we find that Europeans have 20-30% genetic commonality with the South Indians. This could also mean that this mixture of North and South Indian ancestors must have happened before 5000 years. This also puts rest to the theories that Aryan invaders became upper castes and the Dravidians became lower castes as Hinduism originated 5000 years back, years after the ANI and ASI had already mixed and because the upper castes of North India have 30-40% ASI genes and lower castes of south India have 30-40% North Indian genes, meaning the birth of castes happened only after near thorough mixing of the two parent populations of India – ASI and ANI\n\n**Technical Summary on using Genetics for dating migration patterns**\n\nThe first part is sample selection. Like in case of any other study, random samples are taken from a selected population group. Then, a particular gene loci is selected to study. Gene loci have multiple expressions of genes. For example- tall and short beans plants. So the place where the gene sits is the gene loci- in this case the place where the tall and short genes sits is the gene loci. And the tall and short genes are the different kind of genes.\n\nOnce you understand the gene loci and different genes, we can move on to next topic i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)!\n\nSNP is nothing but changes in a gene in a single nucleotide, but it does not change the behaviour of the gene significantly and so no discernible phenotype difference can be seen (appearance differences). So SNPs , because they don’t confer any genetic advantages, can be used as a tools for study of distribution and migration of populations. For example, if a tallness gene is identified and its distribution is studied, you will find variations in its distribution because of the different kinds of survival advantages being tall gives. So tallness gene cannot be used for studying migrations, as any undue selection pressures (like better survival advantages, mate selections etc) can confound the study. But SNPs , which don’t affect the survival significantly, are of great help in studying migrations as the pattern of its distribution can only be a result of migrations. But how does one apply SNPs to interpret the data here?\n\nLet’s say that there is a parent population A. It has a gene with SNP- R1a1. Also let’s say, it is present in a place called X. Now, any mutation in R1a1 will be transferred within that group to their progenies. Also, the frequency distribution of any new mutation will be similar in the population A.\n\nLet’s say after a few centuries, a sub group of population A move from place X to a new place Y. Since X is far from Y, any new mutations in pop A in X won’t be found in the pop in Y. So while new mutations might occur in Y, the new mutations will occur in X as well, but since X is the parent population, it will have more variety of variations. So the higher the degree of variations in the genetics, the older the population must be.\n\nSo when the scientists study X and Y populations and their SNPs, the population which has a higher density of variations will be the older among the two. This is how scientists concluded that the modern humans came out of Africa because of the highest density of variations there.\n\nNow, when the sub part of population A moves into Y, there might me some natives to the land Y too. So when the natives mix with the sub group of population A, those who migrated from X to Y, the frequency/density of the R1a1 will decrease among them due to mixing with natives from Y. So higher the density of the R1a1, the older the population group. That’s how the above mentioned study by Lucotte claims that the Punjab with the highest density of R1a is the oldest population group.\n\n**Other References:**\n\n1.

      <li>Title::: 'Primitive mechanism of traceability of WhatsApp messages without compromising encryption or contents. Digital security experts your opinions &amp; constructive criticisms are welcome'<br />Body: "In light of recent WhatsApp vs Govt. of India case, the government wants to trace back origin of a message that breaks laws of India. While I am a privacy advocate, I have to accept the fact that messaging platforms are used for certain illegal cases such as\n\n1) Terrorists &amp; anarchists threatening security and integrity of India.\n\n2) Videos are shared that ruin lives of women who have been r*ped and non-consented videos shared as revenge.\n\n3) Illegal categories of pornography which need to be traced back sick degenerates to bring them to justice.\n\nWhatsApp says that they cannot provide a traceability mechanism without breaking end to end encryption. I think this is not entirely true and a primitive tracing mechanism is possible without breaking encryption and without breaking contents of message. Here is how -\n\n1) WhatsApp doesn't encrypt metadata anyway so there is no concern about privacy of metadata.\n\n2) When a message is reported to law enforcement authorities, its contents are revealed to authorities so talking about its confidentiality is meaningless.\n\n3) For each message a unique hash can be generated AFTER it's encrypted and stored in its metadata. Since hash doesn't contain contents of messages contents are protected for normal messages. (Hash is how well secured websites/softwares/apps store your passwords so your password is never revealed)\n\n4) This hash from metadata (which isn't encrypted can be traced back for messages that deserve legal consequences for breaking laws.\n\nThis won't be as guaranteed to trace as compared to unencrypted messages but nevertheless it will provide some traceability without compromising encryption/contents of messages."<br />Author: 'sdatar_59'  id: 'nm2y06'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nm2y06/primitive_mechanism_of_traceability_of_whatsapp/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Do Indians love gatekeeping?'<br />Body: 'The definition of gatekeeping in the context of this post is "to allow some individuals and block others". Sometimes its necessary to do so in certain jobs but the problem is, the people who\'s access get blocked feel discriminated against and they lose faith in the system. \n\nIn India, this trait has been existent possibly since the birth of the caste system. Allowing/blocking access to temples, water wells is literally the job of a gatekeeper. In my opinion, some Indians seem to absolutely love to do this job, perhaps because it gives them authority in society. \n\nWe see gatekeeping in many aspects of life in the present day. For example, the toll manager controls access to certain roads, the HR executive filters resumes, university staff filter applications. All of these seem to be fairly decent jobs, the problem is that its very easy to misuse their role and indulge in corrupt and discriminative practices. \n\nI believe that the goal in any society should be to eliminate as many gatekeeping roles as possible and let the process become automated. Unfortunately in India, more and more of these roles seem to get created. In the last election, a certain leader promised to implement universal basic income, but with a non-universal plan of only giving it to the poorest. Now imagine the level of gatekeeping that goes into deciding who is poorest and who is not.'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'nm1gq0'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nm1gq0/do_indians_love_gatekeeping/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What will it take for Indians to develop a culture of abiding by the law?'<br />Body: "I hope everyone accepts that in India (and most of the developing world), people generally don't follow rules. The most obvious examples are beating the red light or throwing trash on the streets, but there are more serious examples of flouting that hurt the country like not paying taxes or not reporting a crime when you are obligated to. \n\nTo my question, I believe there are two ways to become law-abiding. The first way, which is the best way in my opinion, is to have faith in the system. So for example, you pay your due taxes because you have faith that it goes to the greater good, like hospitals or policing. When the majority of citizens are like this, the society becomes a Scandinavian paradise. Just kidding, but its obvious that a lot of good things will happen. \n\nThe second method is to fear the law. In the example above, you pay your taxes simply because you fear that the income tax officers will come after you. So basically you are law-abiding just so you don't get caught. In order to enforce this, obviously the enforcers, in this case the income tax officers need to be empowered. Most of the world focuses on this, some countries like China have success in making the majority of their people fear the law. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'nkwrtv'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nkwrtv/what_will_it_take_for_indians_to_develop_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I am saying this again so that the message spreads!'<br />Body: 'I am watching(again) new videos of the situation outside Indian hospitals. Few years ago my Father died of ILD(Interstitial Lung Disease). The symptoms are similar to that of COVID-19, i.e. the lungs fail and the patient starts suffocating due to lack of oxygen. At that time there was no pandemic. Even then I was running pillar to post for my father\'s treatment. I use to curse every day why the country does not have a national health service. Does it make sense to talk about becoming "super power" when the citizens of the country cannot even have a dignified death?!? It is high time that India learns from this collapse of its "healthcare system"(if at all it has one!). We desperately need a healthcare system on the lines of the UK NHS. Lives matter more than money! No one has to face the black marketeers when their loved ones are dying! We should not repeat this system collapse again! That is the demand everyone of us should make living aside politics. Young housewives who have never worked, when the food earner of the house is lost to the virus, where are they going to go! I have seen heart breaking images of young women crying, who have no where to go. Think about that! A country which talks about dignity/"ijjat" of women has failed to look after them! We should, for heaven\'s sake, start thinking of providing at least the basic necessacities to the country. Is this the sign of the "super power" where we become a laughing stock of the world because we are incapable of even providing the basics?\n\nCertain things, such as healthcare and education, should not be left to private sector alone! A robust public sector in these areas make a difference to the growth of the country. If citizens are not healthy and well educated then that country is doomed whatever it may try to do somewhere else!\n\nAnd for heaven\'s sake stop this left-vs-right nonsense and start thinking of who is the one that can provide the basic necessacities to the citizens, irrespective of who that person is. We are too eager to get swayed by this divide-and-rule tactics so much so that we have switched off our brains when it comes to even thinking of what is beneficial to us.\n\nI dream of a day when the country during election period discusses issues such as healthcare, education, farming, climate change, research, infrastructure etc instead of caste, religion, region and language! It is sad to see during election period TV channels discussing caste, religion, region and language statistics with respect to seat sharing rather than the development agends(and its viabilities) of political parties.'<br />Author: 'meekaa_saangoo'  id: 'nju2n5'<br />Score:61<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nju2n5/i_am_saying_this_again_so_that_the_message_spreads/</li>

It epitomises wealth without development.  Socially, it is probably one of the most backward places on Earth.\n\nAfrica is a new black hole- nobody know what the heck is going on in there, barring some really big international news story. Rest assured, the problems people ascribe to India are ten times worse there (just look at the crime/ rape statistics for South Africa, supposedly the best of the bunch)\n\nMost of the countries of Latin America have exactly the same developing economy problems that we do. They have struggled with massive corruption and crime. But because they tend to stick towards social media content in Spanish, they also slide under the international radar. I would also like to add that the democracy has not flowered to the same extent here, as many of these countries have experiences with dictatorships in the recent past, and once again, free flow of information about the ground scenario is not readily available.\n\nIndia differs from all these places through having wide internet access, a large English speaking userbase AND a large diaspora, all while being a developing economy. This gives news at national, state and local level an overexposure that the rest of the developing world does not have.\n\nYes, it is true- our problems are our own, and we absolutely do not need anyone's validation.

      <li>Title::: 'The problem with NCERT textbooks... (is it just me?)'<br />Body: 'Addressing History and SPL first:\n\nIt’s illogical how the usual emphasis is only about modern history (British Raj period) and the Mughal empire.\n\nLike this content spans the entirety of 7th grade, 8th grade, and parts of 9th and 10th grades.\n\nThere is haaardly anything about the Maratha Kings, the 3-4 major South Indian empires and how influential they were in maritime geopolitics of the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (even today there’s Hindu architecture and culture in SEA countries, something that I was oblivious to all throughout my school years). \n\nAlso, the fact that Nazism, Russian Revolution, and Nationalism in Europe (9th and 10th syllabi) are all taught without building a prior base in the two World Wars. And absolutely no mention of the Cold War and how WW3 almost happened.\n\n(No Cold War but there was a chapter on Vietnam War!? RIPLogic)\n\nThese topics are some of the most important parts of recent History. And hardly any direct discussions on them???\n\nSpeaking of SPL now...\nHow do they not give a thorough explanation about leftist, rightist, and centrist ideologies? Like something similar to the political compass needs to be addressed. How do they teach  case-studies about radicalism, nationalism, capitalism, communism, aristocracies, and dictatorships without that basic understanding of the political spectrum?\n\nIn modern Indian history, there is hardly anything about how the Indian Left (INC) was heavily influential in driving the British out, rather than the Right. We end up believing that there is no such bifurcation as left-wing secularism and right-wing nationalism, and that all freedom fighters had the same ideologies to construct the New India with.\n\nHardly anything about how Marxism and Maoism have influenced certain parts of India. Nothing about some Indian leaders who were well established with the Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. \n\nNo clarity on why Gandhiji was assassinated. No clarity about Indo-Pakistani communal violence, post-Independence. No clarity on one of the largest mass-migrations in History, between India and Pakistan, post-colonialism.\n\nLooking back, I feel that the British rule and the Mughal conquerors were heavily glorified... \n\nIs it just me, or do y’all feel it too? That the current Social Sciences textbooks need to be purged into oblivion and replaced with a new syllabus, carefully revised and updated to meet the modern standards without much biases?\n\nMy cousins from the USA were being taught about the World Wars in 7th grade while we were still sucking up to “the Genocidal Adventures of Mohammad Bin Thuglaq” 🙄 oh wait, there was nothing about “sEcULaR” Mughal rulers genociding millions of Indian people... was there?\n\nThe historical biases are so extreme, it hurts to even acknowledge it.\n\n—————————————————\n\nAddressing Biology and Physics:\n\nI might as well slip in the problem with Biology and Physics textbooks... there’s wayyyyyy too less numerical problems in physics and it’s difficult to adjust to the 11th grade problem-oriented physics suddenly after 10th. Also I feel like astronomy and cosmology should be introduced from the beginning of high-school, because were advancing into an inter-planetary civilisation in the near future and why keep the youngins out of touch with the pace of modern space-races? Astronomy and cosmology are mind-belong subjects... it would be an amazing thing to create interest in the marvels of the Cosmos, among young kids!\n\nAnd biology sucks big time. Nothing is really up to date with all the scientific developments as of late—I’m talking about emphasis on genetic engineering, CRISPR tech, etc. I’d call for an obligatory chapter on Pandemic management as well, seeing how disastrous it can be in a country THIS populous and run by a government that has mismanaged the situation.\nAnd the statistical date is largely outdated.\n\n(Speaking as a med-student, even the medical textbooks need some revisionist ideas, I feel.

US media focus a lot on race issues. Middle East media focuses a lot on sectarian issues. Indian media focuses a lot on gender issues.\n\nIt would be faulty to not recognize the themes and blindly use media as a barometer. Crimes get a disproportionate share of India's media reporting. **Top news sources in the US, don't report rapes in the way India does. For instance, ~12 women in the US were raped/assaulted in the time I took to write this comment (about 15 mins).

      <li>Title::: 'Conspiracy Series l: Teletubbies'<br />Body: 'I used to watch Teletubbies when it began airing on DD Metro and I absolutely loved it. But do you know the ultra-liberal West which lectures India on smallest of issues regarding Freedom of Expression managed to find even this innocent show affecting their children in frightening ways. Some of the arguments are quite...well read the following and decide for yourself:\n\n1. Tinky Winky was a gay icon: According to parents, the tallest purple tubby Tinky Winky was influencing their children to become gay because he carried a purse and had a triangle shaped antenna on his head and was of purple color.\n\n2. Teletubbies was about forced domination of a planet and the Sun Baby was some sort of a Big Boss who controlled the slaves which were the tubbies\n\n3. Teletubbies never spoke meaningful words and engaged in baby talk which hampered toddlers to learn human speech.\n\nI\'m now excerpting an article from CBC Radio:\n\n1. The baby sun is actually a demon\n\nAt the beginning of each episode, a sun rises and the centre of that sun is a baby\'s face. Some claim to see a demonic visage take over the baby\'s face as it expands, just for a second, right before it explodes, thus sending subliminal horrific images to children everywhere. Once you see it, you can\'t unsee it.\n\n2. The\xa0Teletubbies\xa0are\xa0biogenetically\xa0engineered slaves\n\nDefinitely one of the more out-there theories. What\'s the proof? There is no official\xa0backstory\xa0on the creation of\xa0Teletubbies, but it\'s clear to some that the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0are not in control of their own destiny. A mysterious "voice" tells them when to do everything, from eating to sleeping. There is also a vacuum-like character, the Noo Noo, who is constantly keeping the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0in check, making sure they follow orders. Then there\'s the Pinwheel, a godlike structure at the top of a hill that causes the\xa0Teletubbies\xa0to drop whatever they are doing and\xa0fall to their knees and worship whenever it spins. The Pinwheel then picks its favourite character and turns on it\'s tummy TV. Carrot and stick. It\'s all very Big Brother.\n\n3. The Teletubbies are hypnotizing your children\n\nNever mind what follows next: microphones pop out of the ground and chant, "time for Teletubbies" about a dozen times, which led many parents to boycott the shows because they believed it was attempting to brainwash their children.\n\n4. The strange Teletubbies and Harry Potter connection\n\nTeletubbies\xa0and\xa0Harry Potter, both released in 1997, are linked. The\xa0proof? Look no further than the strange antenna on the heads of Tinky Winky, Dipsy, and Po. Their three symbols, when combined, form the symbol for the Deathly Hallows, a key element in JK Rowling\'s\xa0Harry Potter\xa0universe. Still not convinced? Laa-Laa, the yellow Teletubby, has a lightning bolt as their\xa0antenna, strangely similar to the lightning bolt scar on Harry Potter\'s forehead.\n\n5. They\'re giants in real life!\n\nThey look cute and tiny onscreen but in real life they are actually 10-foot-tall giants! Actually, this part is\xa0true.\n\nIf you think these are the musings of just a fringe group,. Teletubbies show was actually banned on these complaints.\n\nNow, just two videos to make your dreams sweeter:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/98lOJGTe1M0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kxWR87llQW0\n\nPlease let me know in the comments if you\'d like this Conspiracy series to continue'<br />Author: 'dreamerimagine1'  id: 'nin5o3'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nin5o3/conspiracy_series_l_teletubbies/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Blast from the past by u/rajarajac] The De Idustrialisation of India by the British and the myth of a stagnant pre Industrial society'<br />Body: ' \n\nNote - This is purely about history and understanding history better, do not attribute political motives to this post.\n\nI have oft seen observations (both on Reddit and on other forms of social media)  that the Industrial revolution flowed thusly,\n\n* There was this sudden period of enlightenment and scientific progress\n* The above resulted in spectacular advances in automation and mechanisation\n* This  then enabled the colonial powers to produce products of outstanding  quality, and most importantly volumes and thus overwhelmed the colonies  in manufacturing.\n\nThis  theory, while logical, is simplistic in the extreme and precludes a lot  of factors, some of which I will touch upon in brief.\n\n* Technological  Advancements - Despite what the narrative states, for nearly 2,000  years, the cotton producing countries, chief amongst these being India,  were at the cutting edge of innovating and refining cotton growing,  refining and production techniques. This tech from India flowed both  East &amp; West (China and the Islamic countries) from whence on it  flowed to Europe by the 16th century. Venice took a lot of the  techniques from the Islamic Empires, and set up the first Cotton  manufacturing units sometime in the 16th century. Yet, the demand for  European cottons paled in front of the vastly more refined, superior  quality Indian cottons and this was to be the case till the early  1800\'s. Quite a few key innovations, right from domesticating wild  cotton to the Cotton Gin (discovered as early as 500 AD), though we  attribute this almost entirely to Eli Whitney (he did mechanise the Gin)  to horizontal looms which vastly increased the output of the loom all  were invented in India and over time diffused around the world. It is  important to note that you had centres of production in South America,  West Africa and India running parallely (but isolated from one another),  but the quality and quantity of Indian cotton exports was far ahead of  the smaller production outputs of South American and African cotton.\n* What  this meant was, for 2,000 years, Indian cotton exports dominated the  global cotton trade, right from the Romans to Egyptians down to the 18th  century European colonial powers (nascent colonial powers), they  purchased Indian cotton at a great cost to their balance of payments.\n\nThings all started to change in the 17th century. What changed?\n\n* The  colonial powers had by now gained access to cotton growing regions in  the Americas. This enabled them to start procuring raw cotton and  setting up their own nascent manufacturing industries.\n* The  quality AND quantity of these industries paled in comparison to Indian  cotton exports, and this new material, which was flooding European  shores, also angered the Wool industry and this powerful force started  to lobby to prevent the growing encroachment of Indian cotton.\n* This  lead to some early protectionist barriers which range from the  ludicrous (mandating by law that corpses needed to be wrapped in wool if  being buried in the Church of England) to the funny (Scottish Kilts had  to be made out of 13 yards of wool) to the outright ban on Indian  Calico Imports by [1721](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Acts).  The outright ban was first preceeded by a softer ban which mandated  that white cotton (unprinted) could be imported, but when the British  Cotton industry still failed to match up to the volumes and quality of  Indian imports, it lead to a full ban. The British were also by then  able to open up markets (for both raw material and finished goods) in  the Americas, and hence started the policy of Import and Export  substitution.\n* Which  brings us to the topic of Indian Imports into Europe and Britain- This  is absolutely stark and belies the whole myth surrounding the benign and  science driven "Industrial Revolution". In 1725, India exported 821,000  pieces of textiles to Britain and another 400,000 to Europe (mostly  France). That is 1.2 Mn pieces of textile Imports. By 1820, the 1.2 Mn  pieces of exports had fallen to 304 pieces. A decline of some 99.08%.\n* This  is made even starker when you compare the raw cotton consumed in  Britain in the same time period. In 1730 Britain consumed 1.7 Million  pounds of raw cotton, yet by 1840 it was consuming 540 Million pounds.\n\nThe  policy of Import and Export substitution (reversing the process of  importing finished goods to importing raw material at cheap rates thanks  to controlling the sources of production and exporting finished  products to a captive market - chiefly India) was now paying off.\n\nHow did the Colonial Powers, chiefly the British pull this off?\n\nSimple,  through a process called War Capitalism, starting the 15th century and  ending in the mid 17th century, these powers gained access to the three  levers of production - Labour, Land and Credit.\n\nNow  interestingly, the great "enlightenment" which was basically a society  based on laws which is held as a cornerstone of the development of the  modern European states was only for the "inside" - that is, only for the  mother countries. Those on the "outside"- that is, the occupied powers,  there was no rule of law and this is exemplified by how the slave trade  worked.\n\nOne of the three pillars  as I have mentioned was labour. Now, labour was exceedingly expensive in  the Colonial countries, and hence they turned to slave labour to  produce the raw cotton needed to churn the giant factories. The payment  for the slaves was made in...Indian cotton, and at the height of the  slave trade (when an estimated 3-4 million of slaves were being traded),  it was not money, but Indian cotton exports into Europe that was acting  as the global currency to procure said slaves, who were then shipped  across to the Americas where they were then worked, quite literally to  the death to increase cotton output to feed the factories back in the  mother countries, who then used this competitive advantage (and the  tariffs and regulatory system to choke Indian Cotton) to slowly  overwhelm the native Indian system of manufacturing.\n\n* This  also brought in great socio economic changes. The Indian producer, for  millenia held great control on the levers of production (a Marxian  dream), he decided who to sell to, at what rates and the volumes he  sold. By 1800 though, British East India Company agents were  overwhelming this system with brute force, including setting up of  monitors in production centres (a loose slave labour type system) and  took away the power of the Indian producer. By 1820, the Indian cotton  centres, and consequently the earning potential of the labour had  collapsed entirely.\n\nAs  you can see above, the root of the "industrial revolution" and the great  divergence lay not in some scientific superiority and human  enlightenment, but on sheer repression - tariffs, gunboat diplomacy ,  cutting access to markets and creating artificial scarcity, slave labour  that powered the giant cotton farms and finally outright colonial  exploitation. Sure, great advances were made in the mid 1800\'s in  manufacturing tech, but even till 1800 (when the "revolution" was  supposedly well underway) the European nations could not even compete,  nay even touch Indian Cotton production in any aspect and needed huge  state intervention and slavery to even begin to compete.\n\nI  would also wish to touch upon the hoary old "what about the railways"  argument and prove that the railways were built at a prohibitive cost  and were seen as a solid moneyspinner for investors from Britain.\n\nThis  worked almost like a protection racket - the British Imperial Govt  attracted capital by offering a fixed return of 5% (sometimes more) on  the funds invested. Now, when the Govt fell short of funds to pay back  the investors (as they often did), the money was still paid back, but  from Indian taxes, not from the Railway companies. By 1870, a good 20%  of the British bourses came from railway infra shares.\n\nIt  is also interesting to note that the cost of the railway construction  was twice that of what it cost to build them in Canada or Australia  (given the same terrain).\n\n[It is interesting to note some of the observations](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=LxKUSZkEyoIC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=a+mile+of+indian+railway+constructed+by+the+british+cost+more+than+in+australia+or+canada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l2lI54B1fq&amp;sig=gFcpGFCDjG8Y-2YLIygfqxbbq6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiv83ov6bLAhVDuxQKHa4ZBPgQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20mile%20of%20indian%20railway%20constructed%20by%20the%20british%20cost%20more%20than%20in%20australia%20or%20canada&amp;f=false) from that period,\n\n&gt;The  guarantee system has not served any purpose whatsoever, the undertakers  of the railway are deprived of one of the greatest inducements of to  economy, **they know that whatever blunders they make, those blunders will not prevent their getting full interest on their expenditure**.\n\n* William Thornton.\n\n&gt;All  the money came from British Capitalists and so long as he was  guaranteed five percent of the revenues it was immaterial to him if the  funds he lent were thrown into the Hoogly or converted into brick and  mortar.\n\n* William  Masey, Finance Minister of the Raj. He also was the one who felt that  the costs were exorbitant and twice that of what it would cost to make  elsewhere.\n\nA commission report submitted to the House of Commons in 1872 established the following costs per mile,\n\n* India 18,000 pounds per mile,\n* Australia 12,000 pounds per mile,\n* Canada 8,000 pounds per mile.\n\nNow  throw in the fact that all the equipment was imported from Britain (at a  ruinous cost) and really, one begins to wonder, was the one supposed  benefit of British rule even a benefit or was it just outright robbery  under the guise of legitimate investments.\n\nSome of my key sources are,\n\n* Steven Beckert\'s Empire of Cotton.\n* Eric Hobsbam\'s \'Age of" trilogy,\n* [http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf](http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf) for the data,\n* Traditional Industry in Colonial India by Tirthankar Roy,\n* Foreign Trade and Commerce in Ancient India by P C Prasad,\n\nOld Thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aclayv/the\\_deindustrialisation\\_of\\_india\\_by\\_the\\_british/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/aclayv/the_deindustrialisation_of_india_by_the_british/)'<br />Author: 'IndiaSpeaksbotty'  id: 'nhwhza'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nhwhza/blast_from_the_past_by_urajarajac_the_de/</li>

They are the Mediterranean, Middle East and South Asia. A lot of the major religions of the world were either born here or became prominent here. \n\nOther regions of the world don't care as much about religion. They either adopt religions from these 3 regions, like Buddhism in East Asia, Islam and Christianity in Africa or have a history of rebelling against religion, like the Protestant movement in Northern Europe. \n\nThis brings me to believe that it has something to do with the climate of the 3 regions mentioned above, which then influences the people to become very religious and go on to create such a rich culture about the interactions of man with God. \n\nSo why is religion important in India?

Other unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquinine have continued in India even as the FDA was warning against its common use.\n\nIndia was the first to widely use dexamethasone before it gained popularity worldwide as a COVID treatment, so all this is not to deny the many good doctors in India. However this is the time to clean up the dark side of the Indian medical establishment.\n\nEveryone who has even a mild cough is being asked to get a CT scan for COVID by Indian doctors.\n\nThe attempt to somehow link black fungus to cow dung smells of political opportunism, to paint Hindus as idiots, and therefore the BJP as idiots.\n\n\n\n[Doctors hint at cow dung-black fungus link as people turn to gobar for Covid ‘cure’](https://theprint.in/health/doctors-hint-at-cow-dung-black-fungus-link-as-people-turn-to-gobar-for-covid-cure/657781/)"<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'ngodug'<br />Score:45<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ngodug/black_fungus_cow_dung_and_bs/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'COVID-19 is endgame for BJP rule, but not Hindu Nationalism'<br />Body: "As for BJP dominated current NDA government has faced numerous crisis and protests, like previous government. It must be appreciated that it managed protests fairly well, if not past crisis fairly well. Like we've seen \n\n* CAB/NRC protest\n* Farmers protest, due to Agri Reform\n* Unemployed / Student protest\n* And, dissent among traders, due to GST and DeMo\n\nThe dissent was among particular group for specific demand related to them. Therefore, government was able to sideline these interest groups. Sometimes by calling them disillusioned, to outright anti-national.\n\nEven opposition was cautious in criticizing government as to labelled 'minority appeaser' or 'anti-national'. So, there wasn't a consensus among leaders of same political party on issues, let go of a common front between different parties across different regions addressing to different sections of society. That played out well for BJP, so they crushed protest with counter protest and news channel propaganda.\n\nCommon people who may have voted BJP for good governance and economic development, might not have agreed with some issue still kept quite, due to overwhelming fear of being called out 'black sheep', in society even though they weren't.\n\nBut, COVID-19 changed all of that. It hit really hard to every section of society. It's not possible for BJP to single out any specific group or section, to be called-out 'anti-national'. It's been overwhelmed by the outrage due to failure of health infrastructure. Everyone has lost someone, or faced problems in their acquaintance, if not themselves or near family.\n\nPeople from patriotic organizations like Sangh, are becoming outspoken critic of BJP. As they can't imagine as weak India begging for help from western countries. BJP has shattered image of 'Superpower India' from last year, when western countries were in trouble and cases in India were controlled. Since, a catastrophe like this after 1 year is not acceptable for staunch supporters as well.\n\nFor the first time BJP's core support since it's inception, the 'urban middle class' has been hit hard, if not hardest. It has since BJP over years have changed from ground-up organization, collecting funds from local shop to big crony party like Rajiv Gandhi's 1980s congress. They've realized a running small business is a uphill task, thanks to over regulations, and on the other hand, government is favoring big foreign corporation in name of 'Make in India' program.\n\nBJP must've learnt from INC mistake that it's not possible to maintain public mandate, if you give them a uniting crisis which affects every section of society. For INC it was, record high-inflation, not corruption that knock it out of the game. Though, it can be argued that corruption charges and nepotism faded it's public image. As, inflation is felt by every individual, while corruption is seen as somewhat acceptable vice.\n\nWith two of the most strongest support base dwindling. And increasing dissent among general public due to failure of health infrastructure. This time it's not easy for BJP to claim back their previous electoral success. Though, agendas like NRC would surely not go away once crisis are over.\n\nIt might be a new style of politics BJP must employ, and that too rapidly. As their news channel propaganda, inducting corrupt politician from other parties, and big rally style promotion are turning nothing but self-inflicting arrow. As seen in Bengal, were without taking ground cadre in confidence, it was a shame.\n\nMaybe answer lies in building more stronger ground organization than, money power from cronies!"<br />Author: 'InsufferableGod'  id: 'nfwo3b'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nfwo3b/covid19_is_endgame_for_bjp_rule_but_not_hindu/</li>

Actors like Mark Ruffalo , Susan Sarandon , Lena Headley all actively sympathize with terrorist's. The gall of Mark Ruffalo to want sanctions imposed on Israel for defending itself is sickening to see. Hollywood should blacklist him from the industry completely\n\nI know it is not an issue of India and not an issue for me to write about however lets' say in 5 - 10 years time if Indian Army has to defend itself from rogue states (Pakistan and China) and defend Kashmir from terrorists. These people would condemn the Indian Army and support terrorists and call them freedom fighters or non state actors\n\nThe next generation of US Leaders in the Democratic Party are openly emphasizing with terrorists. Leaders like (Illhan Omar , Rashida Tlaib , Alexandria Ocasio Cortez , Cori Bush) are asking Joe Biden to enforce sanctions on Israel . I feel Indian American should vote Republican so that such leaders don't every get elected and hold positions of power.\n\nWhat is the issue with with actors like Swara Bhaskar trying to sympathize with Hamas and attack Israel for defending itself from them. It is an issue which should not concern her . It is an issue between Israel and Hamas Leadership. **Is she opposing Israel because people who support the BJP are supporting Israel on social media or is she that jobless because nobody is hiring her in Bollywood** ? She is not a good actress at least Kangana Ranaut despite how unhinged she was on social media was a good actress\n\nUK Politician Jeremy Corbyn is openly supporting the terrorists.  Its like Labor does not do its homework and the Conservatives will win again in the next UK Elections\n\nMore and more when you observe, these apologists for terror can easily mingle with the liberals and use language which is more appeasable to liberals. It is making the choice of voting for more right wing parties far more easier because they do not support terror\n\nSpokesperson of the Congress Salman Nizami is openly supporting Hamas against Israel. It is people like him which are making it far easier for people to vote for BJP so that such a person never comes to power. The BJP for all its faults never supported terrorists\n\nWhat I am getting that is Liberals are going so far left that they end up shooting themselves in the foot of ever coming to power or holding important positions in the governments"<br />Author: 'adiman93'  id: 'nffxqk'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nffxqk/the_liberals_are_openly_empathizing_with/</li>

It cannot get more despicable than this. In the middle of a pandemic, blatantly playing politics of death. Instead of uniting to save lives, shamelessly trying to profit off the disaster. This is something I’d expect from the ISI or CIA to create as much confusion and chaos in India (regime change), not of the main Opposition that holds immense power and sway in the country.

      <li>Title::: 'The business of begging'<br />Body: "\nEver gave 10 rupees to a handicapped begger and felt good about it?\n\nWhile you wanted to help him, you have actually supported something illegal and made the situation worse. Let me explain how :\n\n1. It is a crime in India to beg. It is because it results in kidnaping, human trafficking, child abuse, rapes and many other crimes.\n2. There are criminals in India who manage these beggers in big cities, they are called begging mafias. They are around us, hidden.\n3. They kidnap kids and make them beg and submit their earning to them in the evening. They beat them if earning is less. Most of these mafia are lead by criminals on bail or charge sheeters who have no fear of law.\n4. Since people feel more pity on handicapped kids, mafia break their legs and hands, sometimes make them blind using hot roads. This is becuase we produce more demand of handicapped beggers in market.\nBetter is the earning, more is their business flourishing and more child abuse.\n\nIn short, while you tried to help a child, you actually helped his mafia who would kidnap more kids and break their legs.\n\nIf the statistics are to be believed, an average beggar gets up to 24,000 INR per month. If we were to compute the total revenue generated out of these 4,00,000 beggars it becomes $400 x 0.3 Million beggars x 12 months= $1.25 billion or even higher.\n\nThat beats the revenue for some of the biggest companies in the world including Flipkart!\n\nI am sure you would be wondering, what does police do and not arrest those handlers. However the reality is that no crime happens without involvement of police in it.\n\nWhat can we do to make this non sense stop :\n\n1. Never give them cash. If you want to help, give them enough cooked food. Don't give them something that can be sold in market.\n2. Find a work for them which they can do based on their ability. If they don't want to work inspite of being fitted, they don't deserve help.\n3. Educate your fellow colleagues, family and friends to do the same.\n4. Help them with shelter.\n5. Help them with used clothes, only somehing that they can wear and don't give 10 new sarees that they can sell.\n6. Whenever you see a friend posting a picture on social media donating large amount of cash to a begger, confront him / her and explain.\n7. If we stop helping them with cash, demand for beggers would decrease and these mafias would be out of market and less kids will be kidnapped. This can be a sudden change.\n8. Most important is, we can make it an online campaign and raise awareness. Post this on your socail media account and spread awareness.\n\nNext time you see a kid on the road begging and you give him a cash, consider that your money will be incentive for mafia to kidnap your child next.\n\nSource : https://www.marketingmind.in/begging-in-india-complete-case-study-of-1-5-billion-industry/#%3A~%3Atext%3DBeggars%20In%20India%26text%3DIf%20we%20were%20to%20compute%2C%241.25%20billion%20or%20even%20higher."<br />Author: '_lameboy_'  id: 'neijh8'<br />Score:60<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/neijh8/the_business_of_begging/</li>

Hindus and Jews.\n\nThis thread is about the history of the mutual interaction and relation between two of the oldest extent civilizations of the world.  We will also look at how appeasement politics alienated our ally and affected our own international position.\n\nThe earliest trade contact between Hebrews and Hindus could have dated back to the era of David and Solomon. \n\n*"The king had trading ships at sea along with ships of Hiram. Every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons"*  \\- Bible( Kings 10.22) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osezxweujoz61.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5409dee391fd4473c7e790a4c83af58f5bbcc5b3\n\nAccording to the Old Testament, Ophir was the name of the place famous for its wealth. Solomon traded  gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes, and peacocks  Modern scholars have identified Ophir with Abhira kingdom of western India  [https://bibleatlas.org/ophir.htm](https://t.co/5En1aZrViM?amp=1) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kozdmv3wjoz61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98845f89af12c6c6e776df9c7a368c9c4834702a\n\nBut the first large scale migration of Jewish refugees  to India was after Roman destruction of Jerusalem.  Indian Jewish tradition says first wave of Jewish refugees landed on Kerala coast at  Kodungallur in 70 CE.  \n\nPainting from Paradesi Synagogue (Mattanchery) depicts the scene\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzpdi0pxjoz61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc32ad1199fd90c7aaa71bedf4d10647bdfc19a8\n\nThe Hindu Maharaja of Kodungallur cordially received the Jewish refugees. He granted them land, freedom of life &amp; freedom to practice religion. \n\nPainting from Paradesi Synagogue depicts the king welcoming Jewish refugees.  The king is with full entourage bearing colored parasols \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1t91bxyyjoz61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea3ed85884aa69500af0a2cc5ee5d178d207597)\n\nThis cordial sanctuary offered by the Hindu Maharajas encouraged other Jews to migrate to Kerala for centuries when they faced persecution in the west.  \n\nJewish tradition says their leader Joseph Rabban received many privileges from Hindu Maharaja including tax free land &amp; guild.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o93i830koz61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19571f60c8a5c8a1994199e505bd762654cbd600\n\nThere is also an inscription which substantiates this tradition.   \n\nCochin plates of Bhaskara Ravi Varman record a grant to Jewish merchant Joseph Rabban.  He was exempted from tax payment  &amp; granted hereditary succession.\n\nInscription\'s dated by historians from 8th to 11th century \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tc15ff51koz61.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b1042bc57aff48d1bb66f52ef90a2c6be3518a2\n\nWhat was special about the inscription?  It granted Jews rights that were the preserve of the royal family alone, including firing three salutes at daybreak and on the day of a marriage.  \n\nIt virtually gave Rabban status of a king, and Kerala Jewish  songs call him "King of Jews" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c3rl6hr2koz61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c074de42e865632b76638eeeed9313de10f665\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, the Jews were not only accepted by Hindus with open arms, they were also granted special privileges and they happily thrived. \n\nSoon, they began dominating trade on western coast. **This is the only instance in Jewish history where the Jews were not religiously persecuted**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3g6g7r34koz61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef1d11449e472e52af017a59be0857e95a514159\n\nHindu India became such a welcoming home for Jews  that thousands of Sephardic Jews of Spain fled to Kerala in 15th/16th century during inquisition  Today their descendants are known as "Paradesi Jews" (whites).  \n\nThey have a song which reads - "Hindus are our true brothers" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40igfne5koz61.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bc3547c168654c0c391409a3a67aa708b334273\n\nUnfortunately, Antisemitism also followed Jews to India.  In 1524, the Jewish settlement of Kodungallur was destroyed  by a Mμslim army over a pepper feud. The Jewish houses and Synagogues were burnt.   The last Jewish prince swam to Kochi. Kochi then became the town of Jews.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyd70ov6koz61.png?width=432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=397d51caa897c2db16aca0d40a84a7c68c644293\n\nThe Hindu Raja of Kochi not only welcomed the Jewish refugees, but he also allowed them to build a Synagogue next to the Royal Palace and Royal temple.  The painting depicts construction of Synagogue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1hogo38koz61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d51c912fa21ea4446fbd86bdceb7d43d926e8f6\n\nThe Indian Jews were also persecuted by Portuguese during Vatican Inquisition.  \n\n* This led to migration of Jews to Kochi.    \n* The Maharaja allowed them to construct many Synagogues.   \n* The Paradesi Synagogue of Kochi was constructed in 1568 under the auspices of the Maharaja. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzmfhs49koz61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9131db88a5b867983a6e0047a37fa2410878b63\n\nEven today, the Paradesi Synagogue and the Royal fort temple of Kochi stand next to each other\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dic11xaakoz61.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e5f7b328a9fcaf6761a61bd411cb565c59cabf\n\nFurther, it was a tradition among the Maharajas of Kochi to gift golden crowns to the Paradesi Synagogue.  These are still preserved and put in display at the Synagogue \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tvb79xmbkoz61.png?width=578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58eb58ba907f2b1e0651b41102f1338ecf8eade1\n\nAfter the Balfour Declaration of 1917 confirmed British intention to create a Jewish homeland, many Kerala Jews expressed desire to go to British Palestine.  \n\n* Maharaja Rama Varma XVII of Kochi helped  8000 Jews migrate to the Jewish Holy land. \n* He personally bore their expenses \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img cn1pbvw4loz61...*\n\n This "Tolerance" shown by Maharaja was striking.  According to scholar Nathan Hatz, he would not fight battles on  Sabbath considering  sentiments of his Jewish subjects.  He would also not offer prayer to family goddess on Sabbath because of Jewish reservations on "idolatry!" \n\n The Hindus and Jews have a history of long cultural and intellectual exchange.  The Jewish astronomer Sanad Ibn Al Yahudi ( 9th century CE) translated Surya Siddhanta into Arabic and wrote a treatise on it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omo6794lkoz61.png?width=216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500a0a82744b7f6bc76feb282bfc87fcb2ce9928\n\n Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra (12th Century) was a Jewish scholar of Astronomy and Astrology.  He was very much influenced by Indian sciences.  \n\nIn his book Sefer ha-mispar, he gives credit to Hindus for the origin of Numerals.

      <li>Title::: '[r/IndiaSpeaks - Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Israel uses media to attack Gaza terrorists, COVID spike in Seychelles, and the fascinating life of Annie Besant'<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics thread. Even as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, many major events are happening around the world. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Share and discuss stories in the comments. Here are some stories to get the discussion started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Israel tricks media into fishing out terrorists](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-military-tricks-hamas-with-vague-media-statement-on-gaza-offensive-101621067264735.html)\n\nAfter a property dispute in East Jerusalem exploded into rioting and rocket attacks by Hamas terrorists from the Gaza strip, Israel launched a series of air strikes as well as an unconventional technique to flush out terrorists. Last week, even as air strikes continued, a cryptic tweet was sent out by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), stating that a ground-based invasion was underway. This was swiftly reported by all major news outlets, and a large group of terrorists moved into an underground series of tunnels in Gaza for safety. The air force then struck those tunnels, killing many terrorists - there was no ground invasion, it was an elaborate ruse that nonetheless worked. The US govt has called for peace and condemned Hamas, while leftists US politicians have condemned Israel. Arab countries have also called for peace.\n\n2. [Cyberattack stops major US oil pipeline](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/colonial-pipeline-halts-operations-after-cyberattack/QCIEVMVKDJGGHC2BFF5AFKWLGY/)\n\nA ransomware attack on the company that runs the Colonial Pipeline, an 8,000 km long pipeline network that supplies about half the fuel needed on the populous eastern coast of the US, led to emergency declarations, hoarding, and shutdowns of several pumps, affecting millions of consumers. The attack was by DarkSide, an alleged Russian cyber group that has a history of such attacks but has so far proven elusive to law enforcement agencies in the West. The attack shut down the pipeline until the company paid a ransom of $5 million in Bitcoin, but even then supplies remained tight as the system takes time to get back to full capacity.\n\n3. [Scottish nationalists win elections in UK](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-56927358)\n\nThe Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), which advocates for Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, won a narrow victory in elections to the devolved Scottish parliament. Aside from managing the COVID-19 pandemic, which is on the wane in the country, the SNP has promised to hold another referendum to leave the UK. The last such referendum was defeated, and PM Boris Johnson has opposed another for for at least a generation. The SNP claims that Brexit changed the equation, with a majority in Scotland having voted to remain even as a majority in England voted to leave. Meanwhile, the mayor of London Sadiq Khan won a second term with a turnout of about 45%.\n\n4. [Seychelles sees COVID-19 spikes despite world\'s highest vaccination rate](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/seychelles-most-vaccinated-nation-on-earth-but-covid-19-has-surged.html)\n\nIn a development that has left epidemiologists baffled, the island country of Seychelles, which has a large Indian-origin population, saw an alarming surge of patients that tested positive for COVID-19. This is peculiar because nearly 80% of the country\'s 97,000 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, and 60% have received a full two doses. About 60% of the vaccines used in the country were made by China-based Sinopharm, although 40% are Covishield from SII in India. Most of the severe new cases are in people who received just one dose or were unvaccinated, but in general high vaccination is expected to decrease transmission, which has not been the case here. The WHO is investigating.\n\n5. [US forces begin Afghan withdrawal](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/u-s-forces-leave-key-afghanistan-military-base-n1266974)\n\nIn keeping with US President Joe Biden\'s order to withdraw all US troops in Afghanistan by September 11 this year, soldiers have begun to hand over bases to the Afghan military. This week, the Kandahar Air Force base - a key installation for the former Taliban regime that international forces have controlled since 2001 - was handed over to the Afghans as all US personnel left. However, just last month, the Taliban launched an unsuccessful rocket attack on this very base. Meanwhile, a girl\'s school was also attacked this week in Afghanistan, although the Taliban has denied responsibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Legacy of Annie Besant\n\nThis week, I thought I\'d stay closer to home to explore an interesting character in Indian history, who is remembered only in passing in our history textbooks but who had a profound effect on Indian and Irish nationalism. If you live in Mumbai or Chennai, you would have heard of Annie Besant, either from Annie Besant Road in the former or Besant Nagar in the latter. If you happen to have studied in BHU, you may know her as one of its founders. For the Indian-Americans in California, you may have heard of the private Besant Hill School of Happy Valley in Ojai. Who was this woman, with a clearly European name, who seems to be regarded so highly in India today?\n\nAnnie Wood was born in 1847 in London to an aristocratic family on her father\'s side but a poor Irish one on her mother\'s side. However, tragedy struck the family early: when Annie turned five, her father died, leaving her mother to make ends meet in a society where women were excluded from most political and economic activities. Nonetheless, through help from friends, she received a good education while also becoming sympathetic to the plight of the British working class as well as the cause of Irish nationalism (Ireland by then had been a British colony for hundreds of years). She married Frank Besant at age 20, a Anglican priest: it was a disaster. She wanted to earn money as a writer and became hostile to the Church for its shabby treatment of women: stands that her husband vehemently opposed. They eventually separated.\n\nAs a single woman in England, she perhaps had little choice but to be a radical. She pushed for causes such as secularism, women\'s right, and freedom of thought, all of which were quite alien to societal norms at the time, through her writings as well as public lectures. Eventually, the Church (which, in Britain, is state-sponsored to this day) got wind of her for publishing a book advocating birth control and small families, and she was arrested. Although the charges were eventually dropped, she became a household name, growing as a speaker about socialism and Marxism at a time when workers\' rights were non-existent. She also continued to push two causes that were close to her heart: Irish home rule, as well as a new religious movement that was born in San Diego but established itself in Adyar, Madras (now Tamil Nadu) - this was the Theosophical Movement. In this sort-of-religion, Besant found many of the spiritual answers that she was looking for. She went on to represent Theosophy at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where she also met Swami Vivekanand.\n\nHer work on the Theosophical Movement finally brought her to India, then under British rule, where she eventually rose to be the president of the Theosophical Society. To spread the message of Theosophy and cultivate Indian leadership, she founded the Central Hindu College through donations from Indian princes, and then joined hands with Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya to form the Benares Hindu University, both of which exist to this day. At the same time, she adopted a boy, J Krishnamurthi, whom she declared a "messiah" who would spread enlightenment as a modern day Buddha, in keeping with Theosophical teachings. Krishnamurthi, as an adult, rejected these claims, but helped establish a school in his adopted mother\'s name in California. \n\nBut Besant bloomed into her most charismatic form when she joined the movement for Indian nationalism, seeing in it parallels with her own Irish nationalism and the same brutality of British rule. She joined the Indian National Congress (then mostly a debating society with no political base) and edited the newspaper *New India* to promote Indian home rule. In 1916, she joined hands with Tilak to create the Indian Home Rule League, on the lines of a similar Irish organization, thus finally making the plunge into active politics. Naturally, she was arrested by the colonial government. This created a storm of protests, with the British Indian government receiving two particularly forceful letters in her favour: one from a lawyer who had recently returned from South Africa, MK Gandhi, and the other from a man who had been educated by a Theosophist tutor, Jawaharlal Nehru. She was freed in 1917 and duly elected President of the Congress. But most importantly, the activism around her arrest transformed the organization into a political one - the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nOver time, Besant became disenchanted with Gandhi, who had become the undisputed mass leader of the Congress, although they both shared the cause of Indian freedom through non-violent means. Besant was opposed to Gandhi\'s law-breaking (albeit peaceful) means, opposing his 1920 Satyagraha, and highly suspicious of his socialist philosophy, despite her early work on British workers\' rights. She felt that freedom must be established simultaneously with the rule of law, and even drafted a "Commonwealth of India Bill" to present to the British Parliament, although it went nowhere. On socialism, while she favoured workers\' rights, she also supported property rights and the importance of large-scale industry as opposed to Gandhi\'s views on village-level micro-industry. Her views did not gain favour with the masses, and she eventually fell to the wayside, though remained committed to Indian freedom.\n\nAnnie Besant died in 1933 in Adyar, where, as per her wishes, she was cremated. She remains an enigma to this day: a British woman who did not adhere to the norms of her time, either as British or as a woman. Her religious ideals, though iconoclastic through modern eyes, played a significant role in her philosophy towards Indian and Irish freedom. And of course, she was instrumental in turning the INC from a debating club into a vehicle for activism, and eventually independence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories caught your attention?

Everyday I use to remember these words of his when I was trying to get him medical help. The symptoms that you see today due to COVID-19 are the same symptoms for ILD i.e. the lungs fail and the patient suffer and die due to lack of oxygen. There was no pandemic when my father died few years ago. And yet I faced so much looting from the health industry that I always remembered his words: "Kafan bechney waaley!"\n\nToday, when I see the similar situation played out in the country and at such a mass scale, that his words have started resonating again!\n\nCorruption and black marketing of everything, from oxygen to crematorium is what we have accepted as a way of life. I wonder if every citizen of the country should take a long hard look at themselves, do some soul searching, introspect and try to find out the answer why we have reached this stage. And the answer will not be "they are responsible"...but the answer will be "WE are responsible". Once the pandemic is over, we will go back to life the same old way giving priorities to religion, caste, region, language, under-table-dealings etc. Who cares about the basic dignity of life! What a sorry state of affairs!

      <li>Title::: 'Real World Talk, Part 1 (Hindutva and Nationalism)'<br />Body: " I have not been on here much, but from what I have seen so far, I have the urge to present my points as well. I am probably going to hurt a lot of feelings, but I recommend you at least give it a read and we can have a healthy debate as no one is absolutely right. I also plan to continue this format as I find more topics to talk about.  \nBefore I start, I will tell people not to stop their resistances just because my arguments are logical, as you never truly know what the future will be like so never stop doing what is better for yourself and your community. Logic does not equal to being correct, this is a common pitfall RW people usually fall into when debating with LW. Leftist ideologies like Marxism, Communism, and Socialism usually make perfect logical sense but they have proven to be complete failures in practice. Another darker example would be incest, “incest is wrong because the offspring will be genetically twisted and will live a painful life, but if you use contraceptives, then there is no such problem.” Although this entire statement makes perfect logical sense, we all know it is morally wrong and probably cringed a little inside.\n\nAlso I am not some prediction engine or some sort of prophet. I may turn out to be incredibly wrong, but history has a tendency to repeat itself and humans have a tendency to be very emotional so I am pretty confident in my predictions.\n\nToday’s topic is about Hindutva and/or Hinduism, whatever you may prefer to call it, being on the verge of extinction, and that the only way to save it is via Hindu nationalism. This holds some truth, but not in the way people think right now and even then something must go horrendously wrong for Hindutva to go extinct. People see the surface and immediately assume it’s Islam that is going to be the end of Santana Dharma, this just isn’t feasible, even if, God forbid, India as a nation ends up breaking. Human psychology is the reason. I will borrow an example to explain. You know how some colonies have a single street food vendor who only sells one item, but people have to go there, because if you go to the other colony, you are a traitor; this is Islam. Whereas Hindutva is like an all you can eat buffet, where once you look at the menu you start to wonder how can the restaurant even have this many dishes. Point being, Hindutva can fit any kind of person with any kind of ideology into itself and still be cohesive with itself. While other religions need coercion or force to convert people, Hindutva is a self driving force, especially as there is an ideological vacuum forming in South East Asia. It is also the least repressive of the religions. People may talk about caste based discrimination, but they ignore the fact that it is in fact not supported by any sacred texts and even Ramayana tells the inspiring tale of not dwelling in caste and treating everyone equally. Now the caste system has been largely ignored in the modern India and is only surviving because of reservations, this isn’t just an irony bomb, it’s an entire nuke.\n\nPeople might say, what happened in Kashmir, Kerala and now in WB is proof that I am wrong. But you have to understand, this just isn’t sustainable in the long run. Either we will go through riots or worse a civil war if Muslims really start testing Hindus, and no amount of media whitewashing will stop this from coming down. The other more likely scenario is that India will see an economic boom before that period of brutal civil unrest begins and the whole of Indian Subcontinent, that being India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma will just get sucked into India’s mammoth political and economical orbit. The situation will most likely turn into how USA and Canada were bitter enemies but now have the biggest unguarded border between them. This won’t be the ever elusive ‘Akhand Bharat’ that some people hope for, but it will be a close second. This point is largely ignored by both the defenders of Islam and people who are angry at them. People don’t realize that most Muslim pushback against India and Hindus in the world is just information warfare from Pakistan’s side and they’ve been at it since 47, they have always painted Hindus as some sort of fascistic religion hell bent on killing Muslims. This mainly stems from the Army having control over their economy and not wanting to let go. If they have no ‘bad guy’ they can’t justify siphoning state funds for Army and also militant groups. This is why they fund separatists of India, export their ‘intellectuals’ to the developed world to gain influence. This however is also not sustainable. Indian growth would mean less and less people would want to separate. Imagine a Khalistan completely land locked, with all its rivers flowing in from India, it would be an economical suicide. And as big daddy China’s growth is halting and Pakistan has distanced itself more and more from USA, there really isn’t anyone that can bolster it against India which has all the moral and legal high-ground, as recent surveys have shown that perception of India is only becoming better in the developed world. India has seen democratic rule since independence while Pakistan is often taken over by Army. I expect Pakistan to just off itself like the collapse of the USSR in the next few decades, or reform heavily in favor of democracy. Then there will be a significant portion of Indian haters inside India suddenly left with a hard choice; accept the truth as a guest in your house, or ignore its existence and watch it burn the whole place down. There is a darker ending to this, which I may talk about at a later date.  \nHowever there is another side to this, corrupting Hindutva from inside to the point it can't be recognized anymore where even if people identify themselves as Hindu, they really aren’t. It is not the external threat, it is the rats that we ourselves let in.  \nCults like Radha Soami, these are in essence, people that have managed to convince a handful of people that they are messengers of God or something. This group claims that Ganga is not a holy river, it is just any river. There is no backlash against it as they do not allow recordings of any kind as such only brainwashed individuals have heard most of it, their preachers can just keep making up whatever they want. This cult only came into existence in the 19th century.\n\nAnother cult is Brahma Kumaris, this one is even more outrageous as it’s founder only founded this in 1936, and there are pictures of him in western style suit, far from any spiritual person. This cult claims that Ramayana is fake and Ram is fictional.\n\nIn fact this is essentially how Sai was forced into Hindu Religion. This is basically guerilla warfare on an entire religion.  \nThis argument however does disservice to people asking and working for strengthened nationalism on the back of a common ideology, in this case Hindu Nationalism. Depending on how you think, you might or might not like my take. Hindu Nationalism will slowly die down, whereas Indian nationalism will rise, again, similar to how pre civil war era USA was very divided in ideologies but later assumed a common patriotism to USA even if they disagreed on ideologies. I just hope our economic stability comes early and we do not require a civil war for the Indian nationalism to manifest.\n\nI want to end it by saying it again, no predictions are correct, people far more qualified than me have made predictions that have gone horribly wrong. All of European powers prior to World War 1 thought they would win the war in a matter of months. As such I will still encourage people to keep doing what they are doing, everyone has the right to fight for their ideology, all India needs is self sufficiency and a little bit of time to become the undisputed hegemon of this part of the continent."<br />Author: 'IISCP4999II'  id: 'ndmcpm'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ndmcpm/real_world_talk_part_1_hindutva_and_nationalism/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I just got vaccinated with my 1st dose today!'<br />Body: "After trying regularly for 8 days to book a slot for vaccine and failing to do so every time. The process was really testing my patience, but I knew that there are millions of other people like me who are having the same problem. I was finally able to get a slot booked through Aarogya Setu yesterday evening. I chose 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m, and the vaccine booked was Covishield. I went there with my father, and wore a double mask consisting of a surgical mask and an N95 mask. My father too wore an N95 mask. Intitially, when I reached the center, which was a government school, there was a crowd waiting in 2 lines because the vaccination staff hadn't reached by that time, and social distancing was not being followed. The police officers on duty were trying to move the crowd in line far away from each other and asked people to maintain a single line, and the line became quite long after it and reached outside the school. After that, someone called in everyone inside and distributed, only to be sent back once again by the police. One girl got agitated and raised this issue with the officer, who said that he didn't call in in the line. Around 9:30 a.m., the vaccination staff arrived, and people were called in and distributed a paper slip with site number on it. There were 4 sites made in 4 different classrooms, and an observation area with chairs outside with a pink covering providing shade. My site was site number 2. When it was my turn to get vaccinated, the female police officer asked for my Aadhar Card, and I told her that I had booked my slot using my Voted ID Card. My father told her about my Voter ID, and she let me in. Then the person at the computer again asked for my Aadhar Card, but we told him the same thing, and then he asked for the 4 digit secret code which I had received on booking the slot. Then he checked my name, and the lady sitting besides him asked for my Voter ID number. Then I went to the vaccination booth besides the lady, and she told me that it was Covishield and the next dose would be applied after 12-16 weels, and then vaccinated me. Then I sat in the observation area for 30 minutes and didn't have adverse reactions, and then we headed back home. Then I downloaded my vaccination certificate from Cowin after reaching my home.\n\nI was able to book it thanks to u/only_mann, who in his post around 3 days back, gave a link to a Telegram group (Link -&gt;[http://under45.in/](http://under45.in/)), which gives real time updates on the availability of the slot. He also advised to use Aarogya Setu as it doesn't require a captcha. I was already logged into Aarogya Setu, and as soon as Telegram sent the notification, I immediately entered the PIN Code, Time Slot and tried to confirm my booking, but it showed that the vaccine center is completely booked. I kept pressing the confirm repeatedly, and finally, I got an appointment scheduled for today. I was very happy because earlier, trying to book a slot on Cowin always ended up in vain, even after I entered the captcha and my booking details. \n\nI am feeling very happy that I got my 1st dose of vaccine after so many tries and wanted to share my experience with you people. Once again, thanks to u/only_mann for his help.\n\nAlso, have anyone of you got your 1st dose of vaccine yet? If yes, how was your experience? If no, how is your experience of trying to book a slot?"<br />Author: 'RandomCitizenOfEarth'  id: 'ndjtd5'<br />Score:56<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ndjtd5/i_just_got_vaccinated_with_my_1st_dose_today/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Behavioural Paradox on the part of many Atheists'<br />Body: 'At the start of it, this opinion is not because atheists is not because of their disbelief in religion or God. \n\nThat being said, as Hindus (Non Muslims in case of other countries), when atheists post cartoons on say Krishna, Rama or Sita (or Jesus in case of the West) , the first question that Hindus ask is as to why they target Hinduism while staying silent towards Islam, and the general reply goes line this -\n\n"We criticise the religion which has a majority of the adherents in the state which we live in, since Hinduism has the maximum amount of followers, Hinduism gets its share of criticism".\n\nOn hearing this, Hindus console themselves by saying that the atheists are critical towards all faiths, and it just happens so that India is a Hindu majority state and therefore Hinduism gets panned because of it. \n\nHowever, has anyone thought over this airy assertion of the majority religion being criticised by atheists of a particular country as to how true it is  ? Most take this assertion at face value without considering the obvious riders that come with it. If a Hindu asks an atheist as to why atheists are not visible in Muslim majority countries, the atheists are taken off guard and then reply back by saying that Muslim majority states persecute atheists,and therein lies the lies. \n\nLet us take the classical example of Pakistan. An Islamic State. The moment when Hindus ask as to why do atheists do not identify themselves, the atheists give two major reasons -\n\nReasons \n\n1. The Pakistani state persecutes atheists. \n2. Pakistanis kill atheists. \n\nNow, while this reasoning sounds tempting, let me be the devil\'s advocate for a minute. Where is the evidence  ? \n\nIn the first case, Pakistan does not outlaw apostasy. There are no laws which outlaw apostasy. No federal law, no state law, nothing. So the assertion of the Pakistani state persecuting atheists is a lie. Secondly, even if we assume that the Pakistani state has a bias towards atheists, the same holds true for non Muslims as well. Yet, Hindus identify openly as Hindus, stage protests and highlight biases. That is not only it. Even Ahmedis identify themselves as Muslims when asked (at the risk of Death and Imprisonment). So why can the atheists not  ? \n\nSecondly, in the case of Pakistanis killing atheists, there exists no such data either. There has been no murders because the a certain person identified as an atheist, at least no such reasoning. However, ahmedis have been targeted for classing themselves as Muslims, and yet they recite the Shahadah in Pakistan. However, atheists do not identify themselves in Pakistan despite there clearly being no hate against Atheists. Secondly, even if Pakistanis somehow hate atheists and therefore murder them, how is it any different than Narayan Dabholkar being murdered, Pansare being murdered and Lankesh being murdered  ? Atheists are murdered in India for being atheists, and the data is out there, and yet they criticise Hinduism, without fear openly. However, atheists are facing violence in Pakistan nor is anyone talking about them per se, and yet they seem to be silent. \n\nSo what exactly explains the silence of atheists in public forums in Pakistan and the vociferous condemnation of Hinduism publicly in India  ?'<br />Author: 'atheistnahi'  id: 'nd0r69'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nd0r69/behavioural_paradox_on_the_part_of_many_atheists/</li>

It contained stately edifices decorated with flags and **hundreds of sataghnis (missiles)**.\n\nThe city with suburban towns on all sides had several female dancers and actors. It was filled with gardens and mango groves. And girdled by sal trees.\n\nIt was enclosed by strong fortifications and a deep moat. No enemy can ever enter and occupy that city. It abounded with several elephants and horses, cattle, camels and mules.\n\nIt was embellished with a host of tributary kings who used to pay tributes and with merchants from different countries.\n\nLike Indra's Amaravati, it was adorned by mountains and mansions with precious stones.\n\nWith groups of men and women and adorned with **seven-storied palaces**, it looked wonderful like a board where the game of ashtapada, is played. It was rich in all kinds of gems.\n\nIts dwellings were **constructed on levelled ground with no space left unutilised**. It was abundantly stocked with fine-grained rice and water which tasted sweet like sugarcane juice.\n\nThe city echoed with the sounds of trumpets, mrudangas, vinas and panavas. There was no city on earth superior to Ayodhya.\n\nLike an aerial car acquired by the siddhas in heaven through their austerities, the palaces were perfectly constructed in rows and inhabited by the noblest of men.\n\nThe city was inhabited by thousands of warriors known as **maharathas**. They were skilled archers and sharp-handed. They **would not** pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound. With sharp arrows or with the strength of their arms, they would kill roaring and inebriated lions, tigers, boars etc. in the forest. It was in that city (of Ayodhya) that king Dasaratha lived."<br />Author: 'godfatherezio'  id: 'nctklx'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nctklx/our_cities_which_rivalled_even_athens_at_its_peak/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India has poor governance because it is from the South. Change my mind.'<br />Body: "If you look at countries from North America, Northern Europe and Northeast Asia, they are better governed than neighboring countries to their South. The exception, of course, is Russia, for which I've not yet have an explanation as to why its different.\n\nWhat I mean by good governance is institutions that work properly, so much so that the public has a lot of faith in the system. This is not the case in countries of Central and South America, Southern Europe (relative to North), South and Southeast Asia where people don't pay their taxes properly, in part because they have no faith that the money goes back to society. People don't file a complaint when threatened by local mafia, because the police may be under their wings, the same with the justice system.\n\nBesides that, the healthcare and public transportation are usually in shambles with overcrowding, long waiting time, poor quality and poor maintenance. It is the same set of problems from India all the way to Mexico. The reason seem to be cultural but I haven't done a deep analysis on this. \n\nFeel free to comment on what you think about this."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ncskmg'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ncskmg/india_has_poor_governance_because_it_is_from_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'I want to post on the saints of India. Basavanna . My first.'<br />Body: "During my initial years in  Bangalore I met  a teenager in  the BMTC bus I had been  commuting in . With a  dark red polyester shirt sticking to his sides, kempt hair that oozed oil he also had different  rings on his fingers.  Then the boy was kissing the ring off and  on.  Believing him to be a film crazed teen who was kissing his film icon’s picture on his ring I had a closer look at him. He had a dollar on the chain on his neck too. One more ring on the left hand finger too. But the rings and dollars had no film icon. It was a picture of the Shiva linga. My chennai mind accustomed to Vij ay’ s pictures on teens fingers was in for a rude shock. \n\nSeriously, my mind took a topsy turvy.\n\nKarnataka is the land of Basavanna. Basavanna was a 12th century saint cum reformist who united people through his far sighted reforms. He was the chief minister of the Kalachuri king. Basavanna though a bra h  min wanted every human being to have the knowledge of Divinity or God. His empathy felt the pain of a social outcast of his times for whom  he brought in the concept of universal brotherhood.\n\nImagine this kind of a thought process 900 years ago in the interiors of India. That is why he is considered as a great Mah - aan. \n\nThis Maha - atma with his power as  the chief minister  used the state treasury in various ways to uplift his people . He formed many economic and social reforms. \n\nMaha -tma Basaveshwara launched the *Anubhava Mantapa*, a public assembly and gathering. A la discussion forum  , of the 12th century. Men and women from across various walks of life, from distant lands openly  discussed spiritual, economic and social issues of life in these mantapas. A genuine mode of Sa tsan ga. \n\nBasavanna composed poetry in the local language, and spread his message to the masses. The essence of the Upa nis hads was packed in his Vac ha nas. He made even a common man understand the import of our sacred scriptures. Very much like the Bi - ble that is easily understood by all . Even the illiterate lowest caste human of days could understand great pithy sayings from the Vedas through these Vach an as or Words of Poetry.  He made difficult concepts very simple and matter of fact. For this he used simple understandable Language. I, who was new to Kannada, was able to follow the meaning of these enchanting and soulful poetry..\n\n“His philosophy revolves around treating one's own body and soul as a temple; instead of making a temple, he suggests being the temple. His trinity consisted of *guru* (teacher), *linga* (personal symbol of Shiva) and *jan g a ma* (constantly moving and learning).” - Wiki \n\nThe best part of Bassavanna’s accomplishments were his social reforms. Using his capacity as the chief minister he formulated a casteless society. Mahatma Basaveshwara advocated that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste and that all forms of manual labor was equally important. He advocated that it wasn't birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva b ha kta .\n\nMahatma Basaveshwara advocated the wearing of *Isht aling a*, a necklace with a pendant that contains a small Shiva linga. He was driven by his realization; in one of his Vachanas he says *Arive G ur u*, which means one's own awareness is his/her teacher. Not only this , he advocated the ritual of wearing Janeewar/ upanayanam for all castes and all genders. Today you will find men and women of the Lingayath community wearing the janiwar. \n\nHe was a true empath , a true feminist and a visionary beyond his times. He brought about many a marriage  as   between the so-called high br ah mins and the “lowly” cobbler . Unfortunately all this was not taken well in those days. He was soon killed in a political rebellion.\n\nSome claim that the highly erudite and polyglot Basavanna was a mystic too. He was able to decipher a rare manuscript and thus discover enormous treasury that hidden hidden inside the walls of the palace. He used the same later for his different reforms for his people. Also when a small child wanted his toy bull to be included in a bull race Basava is said to have allowed this participation. Basvaa lovingly rubbed the toy and the toy was said to have transformed into a real bull which eventually competed in the race, winning the first place.\n\nBasavanna spent most of his income feeding people , saints and also the everyday labourer. All his family members took part in this service.\n\nBasavanna’s social reforms and poetry still sit in hearts of the people of Karnataka and guide them. His teachings that there is only one God ( Shiva) and that Shiva is for all irrespective of caste creed , money or gender  is the real concept of Vedanta. It motivates and inspires people even today. I wish new Basavannas are born. We need him today. I worship him and his ideals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday was his Jayanthi"<br />Author: 'SquareBobcat6'  id: 'ncr3ca'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ncr3ca/i_want_to_post_on_the_saints_of_india_basavanna/</li>

I am not a regular OP or commenter in this sub but I religiously go through this sub and receive news and opinions. Recently I've noticed a change here, in Chodi and in a few other specific subs. To my surprise I am not alone and other members across these subs are noticing a change and alerting each other by posts, comments and messages. I believe this sub aims to be a self respecting Indian subreddit (unlike r//India) which isn't so mangled in loathing India's own culture and it's conservative citizens. But lately, there seems to be an attempt at altering this sub's characteristics, whether targeted or self propelled. More and more vehement anti conservatives are showing up as OPs and commentators. Why is that a problem? Because one fish spoils the pond. Just one such lurker can ruin the comment section of any serious post. Members of this and other subs engage with the intruders, trying to explain or elaborate but end up frustrated, disappointed as the troll shows no intention of genuine dialogue. I think every sub must protect it's character against these lurkers. To do that what we can do is visit the profile of any suspicious commentator or OP and see who they really are. If you are sure that they are here to cause trouble, downvote and make a comment alerting other members. Obviously, we wouldn't want the mods to become literal Reddit Nazis like r//india mods who ban people left and right, but if some troll is being extra aggressive and legit members can't shoo him away, the mods should take action. My whole point is, we are here to learn more and to round up our ideologies which we can't do in self loathing Indian subs. This sub shouldn't become one such sad sub. Dhanyawad for reading.

      <li>Title::: 'India has a lot in common with Middle East and Southern Europe when it comes to religion and spirituality.'<br />Body: "No other part of the world has produced intricate and influential belief systems outside this area from the Indian Subcontinent to Southern Europe. Other parts of the world have their own native beliefs but its not as deep and intense as the ones practiced by the people of this region. \n\nFor example, the Vikings of Northern Europe just left their native beliefs and adopted Christianity of the Romans without much resistance. We see a similar trend in Russia with Greek Orthodoxy, East Asia with Buddhism. **I think the reason is because they simply don't think its that important in day-to-day life.** There's something with the culture of these relatively hot and dry climate regions that make us become very religious and/or spiritual and something outside, especially in colder climates that makes them lack the feeling and intensity of a higher being. \n\nIndia is slightly different to Middle East and Southern Europe, whereby there were not so many interfaith holy wars. However, we hear all the time of stories of Hindu saints who become so immersed in their God of choice that every moment, they think of God. We hear similar stories from saints in Abrahamic religions. \n\nThis observation also tells us why secularism and rationality is not so popular in India. These were values that were created in Northern Europe as a counter to South's Catholicism. It was in France, which is half North and South that religiosity vs non-religiosity clash was intense.

      <li>Title::: 'Why Communist Party of India (Marxist) has had no Dalits in its politburo and central committee in the last 50 years'<br />Body: '# Since 1925, not a single Dalit leader could become general secretary of either the CPI or CPM. \n\n&gt; In a way, the Indian communist leaders believed more in Lenin who said  that the intellectual leadership comes from outside the working class.  For example, the Brahmins were never supporters of the communist  movement but the communist intellectual leaders came from among the  Brahmins.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;These people were always with the RSS-BJP, as these formations  were close to their socio-spiritual heart and mind. On the contrary,  the Dalit/OBC masses were with communist parties but not many  intellectual leaders have emerged from them. \n\n The CPI first split in 1964. The breakaway group, the CPM, split again  with Maoist factions leaving the party. These Left parties could not  become a national alternative in the settled constitutional-democratic  set up of India. \n\n A Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, Raja now  becomes the first Dalit leader to be the general Secretary of a  mainstream party in India , 2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# So don\'t they have a dalit ?\n\nAre they against Identity politics , which is what their Centralised decision-making thinks ?\n\n Manik Sarkar, a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s politburo , answer when asked about the same\n\n&gt; “We do not believe in picking up leaders,” he said. “They should emerge  with a merit of their own. We do not believe in caste-based identity  leadership.”  \n\nThough the communists are considered to be "Pro Poor", but they all carry tags of higher caste like,\n\n Sarkar (Manik), Bhattacharya (Buddhadeb), Basu (Jyothi), Mitra (Ashok) indicate caste background. \n\n \n\nIndian communists, who took the theory of class struggle from the  writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ to fight for for  socio-economic change and transformation , but still carry the propriety caste tags in their surname\n\nSo should the communists first start with  de-classing themselves ?\n\n# Communist has been ruled West Bengal , Tripura and Kerala for decades but  why has the educated middle class in these states have not thrown up even one  communist leader worthy of being a member of the politburo ?\n\n \n\nIn 2015 too, a journalist had asked Prakash Karat why CPI(M)’s  politburo always consisted of people majorly from upper-caste Brahmin,  Nair, Kayastha communities (and some people from OBC communities) but  not Dalits. Karat came up with an [evasive reply](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/CPM-talks-of-equality-but-denies-dalits-top-posts/articleshow/46940061.cms): \n\n&gt;*“You ask me this question on April 19 when the new politburo and central committee is in place.”*  Karat said that he would check the records to see if there had been a  Dalit member in the party’s central committee, but he couldn’t remember a  single name.\n\n According to [records](http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2018/apr/08/atrocities-against-dalits-on-the-rise-in-kerala-shows-crime-data-1798522.html)  available with the state government, from the time LDF government came  to power till February 2018, 1,776 cases were registered for atrocities  against SCs and 335 cases for atrocities against STs. \n\n As per the data, the cases have a 92.6% pendency rate, while the conviction rate is only 7.9%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nSo is it because there is no democracy within the party\'s high decision making committee, only the rich ,powerful and influential can get into the core committee ? Most are holding onto the positions for over 10-15 years, they have had just 5 general secretaries so far and all were from influential and higher castes\n\nOne can only know maybe in another 50 years there might be a chance for a dalit to lead the party...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\n[*https://scroll.in/article/904775/continuing-indifference-of-communist-leaders-towards-caste-discrimination-in-india-is-worrisome*](https://scroll.in/article/904775/continuing-indifference-of-communist-leaders-towards-caste-discrimination-in-india-is-worrisome)\n\n[*https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2018/05/no-land-for-dalits-in-cpms-kingdom/*](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2018/05/no-land-for-dalits-in-cpms-kingdom/)\n\n[*https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-talks-of-equality-but-denies-dalits-top-posts/articleshow/46940061.cms*](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cpm-talks-of-equality-but-denies-dalits-top-posts/articleshow/46940061.cms)\n\n[*https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/d-raja-communist-party-of-indiageneral-secretary-general-secretary-cpi-5846100/*](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/d-raja-communist-party-of-indiageneral-secretary-general-secretary-cpi-5846100/)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'nbcmqd'<br />Score:79<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nbcmqd/why_communist_party_of_india_marxist_has_had_no/</li>

Join - [http://under45.in](http://under45.in) \\- This Telegram group is giving real-time updates about vaccine availability and slots. This group sends message immediately whenever a vaccine slot is opened\n2. Vaccine slots open after 4 pm so keep your laptop/desktop open along with Arogya setu app. Keep yourself logged in to Arogya Setu\n3. Search by District, travel for vaccine if required\n4. Check the availability on computer and then book on Arogya\n5. Do not book on Cowin, you need to enter captcha and by the time you do that the slots are all booked. Arogya Setu does not need Captcha \n6. When you go to confirm the booking, if Arogya setu says all slots are booked still keep pressing confirm button repeatedly. Chances are you  will get the slot within sometime. I have tried it for few of us and we have got it\n\nHope this helps. Please go ahead and get vaccinated. Break the Corona chain..

You are nothing to take advantage of. \n\nAs seasons come and go, sometimes people do too, and that is okay. It doesn’t mean having them in your life was a mistake. It doesn’t mean you messed up too much to be loved the way you know you deserve. It doesn’t mean you cannot forgive yourself for allowing them to stay after they hurt you. It doesn’t mean you can’t forgive them for leaving you if you thought they would stay forever. \n\nWith every painful season comes a purposeful lesson. Allow the lesson to teach you. Allow the heartbreak to help you love yourself deeper. You have been through so much and your strength runs deep. I hope you don’t let the people who leave you or deeply hurt you define you. I hope you don’t let what happens to you define you. \n\nYour worth is whole and pure. You are wholesome and wonderful in your own way. The brokenness of someone else doesn’t need to leave cracks within you. Let it hurt, let yourself heal, but don’t leave yourself empty for too long. You are always more ready to heal than you feel. \n\nFill yourself with love and experiences that remind you why being alive is a blessing.

      <li>Title::: '[Hindupost] Shocking details emerge of horrific post-poll violence and sexual assaults in West Bengal.'<br />Body: '\\&gt;Yesterday, HinduPost reached out to Smt. Rakhi Mitra, Secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha in WB, to understand the situation on the ground. What we learnt left us shattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Firstly, the violence is still going on. Despite all the communiques issued by the Governor and MHA to state police and administration, despite visits of NHRC and NCW teams, the violence has still not ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*As per Rakhi ji, as of 9 May 2021, 18 BJP supporters or their family members have been murdered, 170 women have been raped, 6126 women molested, 2942 villages have been affected, 4105 people are severely affected (houses burnt/vandalised etc) while 33,840 have been rendered homeless (fled in fear) out of which 14,245 are from SC/ST communities. 300 villages are severely affected. 1800 people have fled to neighbouring states of Assam, Odisha, Jharkhand.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe highlighted a few incidents:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Gosaba and Basanti, South 24 parganas district: JCB (bulldozers) are being used to demolish houses, with full knowledge of local administration. In parts of the district where women are being raped and molested or houses burnt, no ambulances are being allowed due to which there is no official record in hospitals. This is how they are ensuring that officially, these crimes simply don’t exist.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Haroa, Basirhat, North 24 Parganas district: A BJP Mahila Morcha worker was stripped naked publicly, TMC goons then urinated on her palms and made her lick it.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Bowali, South 24 Parganas: 6 girls, relatives of BJP workers, were forced to strip naked and dance to the ‘Khela Hobe’ (TMC’s election campaign song, which means ‘Game On’) song.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Canning West AC (Assembly Constituency), South 24 Parganas district: A 14 year-old girl standing outside her house was attacked. Her nightie was torn with a blade, and once nude she was molested and a video shot. The goons said they are saving the video for ‘future use’.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Sandeshkhali, Hingalganj, Minakha blocks, Basirhat subdivision, North 24 Parganas district: 20-23 women have left their homes because they were threatened with rape.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Nabagram village, Jamalpur AC, Purba Bardhaman district – on the evening of 2 May, TMC MLA Alok Kumar Majhi’s men came and destroyed 17 houses. Late at night, they returned and warned everyone ‘Khela Hobe’, which sent waves of panic through the village. On 3 May, around 11.45 AM they returned with weapons, including firearms. They started asking for BJP worker Ashish Kshetrapal’s house. First, his father came out and they chopped his hand. When the mother, Kakali, came to save her husband, she was chopped from behind on the neck and died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Her body was lying unclaimed in the government morgue for 4 days, and it was only when Rakhi ji did a video on this gory crime did the administration do her cremation. Ashish had to go underground and couldn’t even perform his mother’s last rites. His father’s hand was operated on, but is as good as useless now. On the night of 3 May, the TMC goons again attacked Nabagram village – this time in front of a large police contingent which was just 400 feet away but which just stood watching. 150 people have been rendered homeless in that village. In total, in Nabagram and nearby areas of Bauripara, Sashtitala, 85 houses are totally empty – entire families have fled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;On 9 May, a BJP worker Bappa Chakraborty’s house in Jagatdal, North 24 Parganas was ransacked by TMC goons. This is the area of Barrackpore BJP MP Arjun Singh. When Bappa approached some central forces stationed there, he was told to approach police. The family somehow managed to file an FIR. At night, the TMC goons returned, they switched off the electricity in the entire area and announced “Today you have filed an FIR, now we will return tomorrow and ‘Khela Hobe’.” No police protection has been given to the family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Rakhi ji added, “There are no FIRs for any of these cases due to the atmosphere of terror. WB Police and CID will say what Mamata wants them to say” The Nanoor, Birbhum gang-rapes of two BJP polling agents are also being hushed up, she said. WB Police has termed them ‘fake’, and one of the alleged victims was made to attend a press conference alongside murder-accused TMC strongman Anubrata Mondal, where she denied she was raped. HinduPost has learnt from other sources that such ‘political’ sexual assaults are usually hushed up in West Bengal with the victim’s family forced to ‘compromise’ in exchange of money.\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;\\*\\*Rakhi ji and her daughter have also been threatened. On 2 May, when her daughter was returning home, 15 TMC goons accosted her and told “Now you have also joined your mother. We will do ‘Khela Hobe’ with both of you.” On 3rd evening, 30 TMC goons destroyed the BJP flag she had put up near her apartment building in Kolkata and menacingly shouted, “This is the house of Rakhi Mitra.”\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.hindupost.in/politics/shocking-details-of-post-poll-violence-in-west-bengal/](https://www.hindupost.in/politics/shocking-details-of-post-poll-violence-in-west-bengal/)'<br />Author: 'littichoka'  id: 'naj57o'<br />Score:144<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/naj57o/hindupost_shocking_details_emerge_of_horrific/</li>

[In  1990, India\'s GDP per capita was $367.56 then in 2018 it was $2009.98.  China\'s GDP per capita was $317.88 in 1990 and then rose to $9770.85 in  2018.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)\n\nWhat no one takes into  consideration was when India and China did economic reforms. China did  this in 1978, India started their process in 1991. When the economic  processes started, we will call this **Year 0**. So China has experienced **42** years of economic reforms and then India has experienced **29** years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||China|India|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Year 0|$156.40|$303.06|\n|Year 27|$1753.42|$2009.98|\n\n**ChinaIndiaYear 0**$156.40$303.06**Year 27**$1753.42$2009.98\n\nTable: [GDP Per capita](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:IND:GBR:CAN&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:IND:CHN&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)\n\nSo as shown, in 27 years China has increased by $1597.02 while India has improved by $1706.92 as shown by the above table.\n\nChina  also started like us, starting with assembling and slowly moving up the  value chains. Look at them now. They do many things better than India currently but in time, it should improve.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAgainst the Brain Drain Narrative\n\nIndia has [about 32 million NRIs and PIOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin). There are those that emigrate or were born in these countries due to  British moving Indian labourers to work during the shitty colonial  times. Such as Fiji.\n\nNow from my  observations, not everyone who leaves India is necessarily a brain  drain. Many of those who go to Arab countries for labour work. Im sure  Indians know about the labour camps they have there. These people remit  money back to India. [India has the largest remittance in the world with $69 billion USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance).\n\nAlso,  it can kind of benefit India in a way of these people leaving. For example, spreading cuisines, people taking interest in Bollywood,  Diwali, Holi and more. Except those that are those NRIs who think  they\'re superior and loathing. The NRIs I know of like India but are  just here to have a simpler lifestyle and to remit money back. My  parents plan to move back to India and my parents left cause my dad  isn\'t fond of his parents.\n\nMore points against Brain Drain:\n\n* [India ranked 9th in TOTAL scientific papers](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php)\n   * Ranked 13th in 1996\n   * Ranked 11th in 2006\n   * Ranked 4th in 2019\n* [With 50,000 startups registered, India aims for as many more by 2024](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/with-50000-startups-registered-india-aims-for-as-many-more-by-2024/articleshow/71440117.cms)\n* [Labour force is about 500 million people.

Again, barely scraped the surface when it  comes to science. Then we have many companies investing into India,  providing jobs and benefiting the country as well.\n\nAlso,  I know that the number of NRIs and PIOs are 32 million. India labour  force is 500 million. So that means 6.4% of the labour force left India.  According to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/k2kskg/indians_top_the_list_of_educated_migrants_in_rich/), there are 3.12 million highly educated migrants. So thats 0.624% of India\'s labour force.\n\nAnd again **If India is improving, does brain drain heavily impact the country? Isn\'t it still improving?**\n\nIm  probs gonna get bashed for this section but idc. This is truth. Those  who leave don\'t necessarily cause brain drain. Me for example (I plan to  move back cause I hate australia). I also remember a  comment going  against the narrative of brain drain so I am defs gonna get bashed cause  people hate the truth. Ima say "typical redditor" if you criticise me  on this lol\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Views and Experiences\n\nBelow  is some of my opinions. I just wanna say I am technically an NRI and I  was raised in America, living in  Australia. Though I consider myself [ABCD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/iu8m3q/indians_born_in_india_vs_abcds/)\n\n**My personal experience in seeing manufacturing**: I live in Australia. In Sydney the metro trains that were made were made in Chennai. Here is a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/cnt9he/a_while_ago_i_saw_a_post_about_how_india_made_the/)  for that of which I posted. Very nice trains. When I went to India, I  got a OnePlus phone (gonna say that this was before the boycotting. Im  not getting rid of my phone that i paid for) that was assembled in   India. Then here in Australia, theres heaps of medicines that are made  in India. I buy my clothes in India and they were all made there except  for a small amount of shirts.\n\n**What needs to be done**:   Need to build roads, roads and more roads. Roads that are paved that   too. Roads are the underlying foundation of a country. This needs more  work.\n\nInvestment in ports,  airports and more. I will say however airports are now heaps good in  India. I remember Mumbai airport being utterly trash before the new  terminal came. This is both domestic and international. I also went to  Delhi airport and saw how massive and nice it was. Even the outside   area was impressive.\n\n**THE COUNTRY IS NOT DOOMED.** To the doomers, [OK DOOMER](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1411973-doomer)\n\nHope  you enjoyed this post. Please feel free to comment more links of  investment that I might have missed. I posted this due to my desire to  share information. Many people are doomers or full on loathing due to  the media nowadays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# India companies investing into india: dataset and dashboard\n\nSo  I made a data visualisation  dashboard so that people can interact with  it and explore it. I made the  dataset based on the news articles I  have seen and recorded them and  filled in the dataset where necessary.  This includes company name,  company country, investment state, category  and the amount.\n\nThe dataset  requires further exploring, such as you can explore "state  investments"  category as it contains investments that are not mentioned  in other  articles. These includes how much a state has attracted in  investments.  Such as Uttar Pradesh attracting 1.88 trillion rupees in  the last 3.5  years.\n\nThe dataset is  linked to  the Google Sheets. So it will be updated automatically after I  add a  new record. Feel free to notify me of any investments you might  find. I  will add it if appropriate. Special thanks to [u/itisverynice](https://www.reddit.com/u/itisverynice/) for notifying me of investments.\n\nNote:   A lot of the news articles don\'t list how much a company is investing in the dataset. If you want, you can check the source and notify me if   you know how much that company is investing. The source to the dataset is added in this comment.\n\nLink to the dashboard: [https://public.tableau.com/profile/plebman1125#!/vizhome/IndiaInvestments2020-Present/Dashboard1?publish=yes](https://public.tableau.com/profile/plebman1125#!/vizhome/IndiaInvestments2020-Present/Dashboard1?publish=yes)\n\nLink to the dataset: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ye7HR8jo0ML\\_d8wkHQF8bYAPJViLaHjeypwA\\_dxpKec/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ye7HR8jo0ML_d8wkHQF8bYAPJViLaHjeypwA_dxpKec/edit?usp=sharing)'<br />Author: 'stupidperson117'  id: 'naij5a'<br />Score:107<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/naij5a/a_fellow_reddit_user_deleted_their_account_and/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Story of my life. Was bored'<br />Body: "\n\n\n\nThis is a long and arduous passage with full of grammatical errors that to be honest, I don’t advise you to read. The 10 minutes you spend reading this can be used somewhere else.I’ve only written this as I didn’t  have anything else to do for an hour and no one to ask for help.\n\n\nNarcissist-A disorder in which a person has an inflated sense of self-importance.\nNarcissistic personality disorder is found more commonly in men. \nSymptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism and a sense of entitlement.\n\nThis is what my mother calls my father on a daily basis. To be honest I didn’t know what it meant so I had to google it online and saw the description mentioned above.my father,being a doctor is regarded pretty high in the society. Ever since I could remember I’ve seen my father get respect from passers by and this made  me think that being a doctor isn’t that bad. There are  people who tell themselves that if they had gone back to the past at a certain point,they would have still made the same decisions.I’m not from this group of people.after seeing all the things I’ve witnessed in this house for the last 4 years, if I ever had a chance to go back,I’d gladly take it and get out of here. This family for the last 4years is basically what I can describe as a coin that is rusted on one side and shiny on the other. The shiny part is what the community thinks of this family.how we are perceived outside.the rusty part is the life inside the house .let’s start with the self proclaimed God of the house,my father. Being the elder son in his family,he always had a deep attachment to his parents. So deep that the bond between my grandmother and him are so close that whatever happens in this house regardless of whether it being a personal matter or not,whether privacy is needed or not,she will get to know anything and everything that happens in this house.there is a positive reinforcement that exists between them, in such a way that whatever he tells,she believes and follows and vice versa. There is no third person ever involved.He is someone who puts his mother and his brother’s family on a pedestal but treats her wife’s family like garbage. Countless times he has addressed my maternal grandparents with words that no should ever hear,in front of me and the rest of us.he uses similar words on the other members in that household as well. Even though on the outside he might seem as the ideal son in law,on the inside his intentions are different.\n\nMy father isn’t the same person today that I remember from my childhood. Granted even though his father paid for his education, he had worked initially in his career. He didn’t have to pay for the house he’s living in , and the fact that he didn’t have to pay for my education, were even though considered as ‘wins’ in his life, in reality these were basically seeds that would develop his narcissistic qualities. Having numerous pleasures such as going on countless trips abroad alone, his craving for alcohol,audio,cars,cameras and whatever new tech he catches his eyes on, has infact left him as barely the man he was before.what started out as a family trip 4 years back,I would’ve never thought it will end with the family’s reckoning.if one line was my fathers spending money on his so called hobbies ,another line was my mother’s need to know how the money was being spent,these 2 lines crossed 4 years back. What led was countless fights involving numerous name calling by both parties,fights that led to even physical abuse by by father toward my mother on a number of occasions . This is done in front of their children,as they need an audience for their fights at all times. But outside the house, we’re this fake “happy” family that was living a fake “happy” life. The time I’ve spent with them to try and solve their fights, the amount of times , me a grown adult had to cry so that they would just stop fighting are better not said. He displays his anger by smashing my mother’s appliances and the devices that she uses. And the worst part is , there is no one to control him. For anything. He has told me a number of times that he will do whatever he wants , whenever he wants and that no one can or will control him. In my opinion ,in his mind he thinks of himself as someone who will only live in luxury but in reality I think he has forgotten what life really is. He tries to spend money on whatever he can find to achieve happiness, but he can’t. What he gets every single time is temporary satisfaction. The fact that he gloats about the amount he’s spent on the premium wires he uses to connect his cables, and the experiences he’s had on his numerous trips he’s gone alone doesn’t help anyone. Has he provided for all of us, definitely yes.have we asked much,no. If the fact that he puts cameras all over the house to see if we are going somewhere, installing a tracker in the car to see where we take it, having direct access to me and my mother’s bank account to know how we spend each and every rupee, and eavesdrops on our conversations doesn’t show that he wants to control everything in the palm of his hands,I don’t know what else will. And if you think that we have access to his total expenditure on himself, wherever  he’s going abroad or how he’s generating money,sorry. Only he himself has access to that. His mother is always in support of him and thinks he is doing nothing wrong. \n\nSo who can bring justice to this family?who can right the wrongs done here?\nAnd what’s the point of even hanging on?.I’ve told him a bunch of times,if he wants to live a life of a bachelor,none of us will stop him. Just let the outside world know it too.\n\n\nSchizoid personality disorder -A condition in which people avoid social activities and interacting with others.Schizoid personality disorder typically begins in early adulthood.People with this condition don't desire or enjoy close relationships, even with family, and are often seen as loners. They may be emotionally cold and detached.\n\n\nThis is the term used by my father to describe my mother’s present “condition”. According to him it has been like this since the beginning of their marriage. I struggle to believe that as I’ve seen them happy together. Granted that it is more or less a miracle if i can ever see them happy now,there was a time when I didn’t worry about them.  My mother was someone who started her life with dreams. But after her marriage , she was pretty much forced to give up on that and look after the family as you do in Indian households. She had looked after my well being and had done more than what was needed so that both her children could have a good childhood. Even after this, once her children were somewhat grown up , she started pursuing an endeavour on her own. Without much support from the family including us, she was able to make herself a name in our community as one of the top in her field of art. Unlike me father ,  she  gave most of the money she received either to a charity or whatever would help her in pursuing her art. Looking back now , 4 years ago, we were a good family. With my father,mother and myself in respectable positions. But as fate would have it, the 2 lines that I had mentioned earlier just had to intersect and life in this house was never the same in this family.  My mother was having constant fights with her mother in law and my father , even though married and spends more of his time with his wife, listens to his mother’s advice regarding everything. Just as I had stated before, my grandmother is the more prominent figure in my father’s life than my mother can or ever will be. What started out as daily fights , this soon progressed to cussing of my mother’s parents and her family and finally led to certain episodes of physical abuse. My father,  as a doctor gave the same description of her countless times and that she needed medication. And me being a medical student at the time, blindly agreed. \n\nWas this true?. To be honest ,I can never be sure.  Do I think my mother has a problem, definitely yes. What else do you call someone who locks herself in a separate room, uses a cocktail of her phone,a power bank, the WiFi, the a.c and the bed for the majority of the day. This has happening for almost a year.Everyday she googles articles on narcissism and sends them to me along with long and very poorly written hate speeches about my father. I don’t read them all. In my phone ,the only person on mute is my mother . Not because I don’t want to help her, but I can’t. Even I myself had called my mother names similar to what my father calls her . The situation I’m in is a little tricky to say the least and umpteen messages and calls daily from my mother with complaints about me and my father will never allow me to keep their matter aside and focus on my career. She is very religious but I think at the moment she is relying too much on religion.So much so that she is close to religious fanaticism. Going behind religion and leaving your whole life in disarray is never the answer. She also has a lot of mood swings. My mother who shouts at me and who throws vocal abuse on me and my father in the morning and afternoon may change into a different person in the evening. As in more calm and composed.She might even sit for dinner with my father at night as if the whole fight was an act of some sort. And the fact is there is no reason for this . She can go from laughter to rage to crying in a matter of 10 minutes or so based on what she hears. Lately she has seemed a bit delusional at times, by telling me that her husband and his mother are plotting against her and associating certain animals to certain people. She has also relied on pseudoscientific practices so  as to find some meaning in her life. \n\nI don’t blame her for any of this. The fact that she gets very little respect as well as financial support from her husband,lack of support from her in laws and lack of a proper friends circle not including family members might be the reason . Even though she can call a certain member of the family as a friend, I don’t find it beneficial for her as she still remains locked up inside her room for most of the time.\n\nShe always tells me that she is staying together for the kids. Even though I had supported her a lot initially, right now I don’t think this relationship can survive.it’s like a dead animal inside the house or a leg that’s pretty much decayed and needs to get amputated. There is no point in keeping it any longer. Regarding support, I’ve told her that I will always be there for her. She has gone through a lot In this house. I can’t say the same for my father as he’s not been in the receiving end of the suffering as much as my mother.\n\n\n\n\nUseless -not fulfilling or not expected to achieve the intended purpose or desired outcome.\n\n\nOther than calling my name, I think this has to be the word I’ve been called the majority of the time by both my parents. It’s such a staple word in this household that to be honest I don’t mind it anymore. Granted they do speak much harsher words, but I think I recall this word the most to describe me. After a pretty much uneventful childhood, I had a bit of luck towards the end of school, and was able to enroll in a medical college. After putting in 2 years of hard work for my exam, and sacrificing a lot in the process I was not the same as before. I’d lost a lot of friends because of my pride and I was never able to adjust to the place that I had joined for my medical education. This was maybe because my father had decided where I should study rather than giving me a choice. Even though I was able to study , the fact had always remained in my head that I thought I deserved better . This led to me missing out on a lot of classes due to lack of will and my father had to solve the problems that I had created. You could say the fights between my parents  that started in the middle of my higher education could be one of the factors ,but I can’t say for sure if I would’ve changed even if those never took place. The fact that even after becoming a doctor , I still didn’t know what I wanted to become and again lack of will, led me to lose some time. The comforts of my home didn’t help one bit in sharpening my vision for the future. The consistent questions and mockery from both my parents regarding my future was the icing on the cake. I don’t blame them for this though, as I’m a master at procrastination and often take a long time to do simple tasks. On rare instances I do attain a glimmer of inspiration and achieve a goal. The numerous fights between my parents that I had to intervene,the time that I had lost, the tears I’ve shed, the abuse that I was yelled at, has affected me a lot to say the least. I think my sibling did make a better decision in life by not associating with them during their fights. Guess the mental trauma will stick with me. And the fact that I couldn’t share whatever was happening inside the house to anyone of the outside world, since our family has “a good name” was not something easy to live with. Maybe this trauma was what has led me to become what I am now. The feeling of worthlessness is pretty strongly nailed on me by my parents. And I’m at a point where I don’t know when I will be worth something.\n\nAll this had led me to believe that I don’t have a place in this house. There is a limit to how much you can fake to the outside world. Even though I lack intent while performing most of my tasks, the task that is at hand in front of me , is looming large. At least once should my actions have some importance. Doing most of the grunt work in the house, made fun of for my incompetence , and striving a lot for a happy family has taken its toll on me. For most homes, an understanding family with interwoven values is a given. For me , I consider this a miracle to say the least. With my father asserting complete dominance over my life,even when I’m an adult had often confused me. I thought it was the same for other households but I was wrong. And my mother’s daily tantrums about my father didn’t help one bit. All of this  had led me to take this decision.\n\nAccording to my mother , I had done something what she considers as the worst thing to ever happen to this family. Something she says that will never be forgiven and she will not allow it under any circumstance. According to my father we belong in a certain “section of the society “ and we cannot stoop low to another level  but we must look for associations that are either at the same level or above. These levels, sections has always puzzled me but my grandmother is pretty much a scholar in this field. She can categorically place each family in a locality as per a system that was baffling to me. I thought it was something that existed only in pre independent India but as far as I know it’s still at large. Basically a revamped caste system. There are many that I know of who instead of disregarding this system, use it to form associations and receive financial incentives for the said association. They take these financial incentives because they think they deserve it for being born in the right family. Going back to what my mother said, what she meant was that I had not followed this system and chose a path for my self. Even 1 year back,I’d never thought of doing something like this. I had geared up to be another member of this system. But I had met someone last year that made me change my line of thought . The grievous sin that I had committed was that I had asked my mother if I could have an association with a girl of another religion. I’m sure I need not worry about this in probably any other country . I think most of you will stop reading this here as I know the majority of readers follow the same system. Someone who was in the same profession I’m in, someone who I connected with a lot and was my pillar of support for a year , someone who was from a good family as well. “The worst thing that a son could ever do”. “We will disown you “. Quotes such as these should have made me recalibrate my decision, but I’m fed up of this fake life. I’m sick of looking at a person  at the level their family is at or the amount of financial incentive received rather than the person itself. This financial incentive that my maternal grandfather gave my father cause of this system is now what’s ruining this family. I know  whatever relationship I had planned won’t work out, but I’m damn well sure I don’t want to be part of this pathetic system.\n\nSo my plan right now is first and foremost get out of this house. If you’ve read until here, I’m pretty sure I’m already out of this place. Until I find worth in my life or some sort of redemption for what I’ve faced in there, I won’t be coming back. I’ll promise to be a support for my parents at all times but they should find a solution for their situation. Never fight in front of your children. Never touch alcohol. Never think you’ll achieve happiness by buying everything you set your eyes on. Never choose someone on the basis of their level in the society. Never demean your children. Life in this house has taught me all these ideals.But in the wrong way. I hop e and pray that I can make it right one day."<br />Author: 'manofculture585'  id: 'nagkml'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/nagkml/story_of_my_life_was_bored/</li>

I know what's happening in the country but I don't read up further to form a stance/opinion on the subject matter. Having said that, I can't help but wonder this: \n\nHow can any central government (be it BJP or Congress or any other party) not know what public sentiment a certain activity cause? Recently [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/new-prime-minister-residence-a-part-of-central-vista-project-before-december-2022-2427173%3famp=1&amp;akamai-rum=off) news made headlines. Now I really can't believe that no one in the government suspected that doing such a thing in such a demanding time would generate a negative response from the public. I understand that many ministers are semi-educated or uneducated (even idiotic sometimes), but don't they have highly educated staff in the form of advisors etc.? Whenever the central government does something (like making laws, giving out a national level decision, making an announcement etc.), don't the advisors/intelligence already know what the public's reaction to it will be? And the fact that the govt. still decides to go through with this action; what does this imply? Are there other social/economic/tactical/diplomatic undercurrents that the common man doesn't understand? \n\nWhat I'm trying to understand is: Does the common man actually understand what's happening with the government? Do we actually understand what their actions aim to do? The power to vote definitely resides with the public, but do we also have the required insight to form our decisions?"<br />Author: 'YOU_TUBE_PERSON'  id: 'na86a9'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/na86a9/power_of_the_common_man/</li>

Now everyone I know there are well meaning, genuine folks and always have been my well wishers but the stuff that they believe in is just religious fundamentalism. They're everywhere, even here in NZ (our PM visited their temple before the elections last November). Sometimes I wonder how exactly western folks believe in that stuff. Their philosophy itself is not bad and they take a lot from Christianity, they do have very good ways of attracting followers but they treat the *itihasas* as literal histories. They agree on the Earth's age and that the fossils are real, but they think that humans existed since the beginning and were walking between the legs of a brontosaur but although modern devotees do accept Darwinism and treat the Dashavatara as a sort of foreshadowing. Nevertheless... taking the Ramayana and Mahabharata literally... they're more fantastical than Ragnar Lodbrok and completely in the realm of Norse/Greek/Egyptian mythology. Me, being the slow poke, went along with the anti-science stuff all the way through high school (at the time, I asked myself exactly which religion was true) and only after university did I actually start questioning the entire concept of God (I still consider myself Hindu, but I'm not one bit religious).\n\nLol Idk it was fun but looking back, wacky as hell. I can understand worshipping these deities for the qualities that they represent which we ourselves could adopt in different aspects of life (which is what I do now), but I really don't kid myself.

Every media house in the world has its political ideology or serving its political paymasters. CNN is a mouthpiece for the Democratic party in the US and Fox News is a mouthpiece for the Republican Party. Similarly in India NDTV leans towards the Congress and Republic leans towards the BJP.\n\nFrom all the media houses (online , television and print) in India is centrist or Centre right Country .

      <li>Title::: 'Unravelling the Liberal-Islamist Nexus. How do Islamists manage to effectively hide under the ‘liberal’ umbrella not only in India, but around the world?'<br />Body: 'Motivated by a post on this sub yesterday. \n\nLogically, any liberal worth their salt should be ideologically opposed to Islamism. Liberalism stands for Freedom; fundamental Islam is intolerant, oppressive, and restricts freedom at every level. Just look at any Sharia state. Yet, time and again we see Islamists hiding under the liberal umbrella. In India especially, one of the biggest grievances from the right is that Liberalism has gotten corrupted/perverted to the extent that it is now inseparable from Islamism. So, how exactly did that happen?\n\n\n\nIn my experience, there is a conscious effort by Islamists to initially create sophisticated ‘liberal’ images (for example Rana Ayyub). They use the liberal platform to first build up credibility and earn the trust of like-minded people. Then, once they have a large platform, they begin subtly pushing their Islamist ideology. For example, they will only talk about selective events (like crimes against Muslims) to paint a picture of Muslims being oppressed victims, and then establish the idea that any criticism of Islam only contributes to that oppression, hence anyone who criticised Islam = evil fascist bigot. \n\nOf course, they won’t talk about cases where Islam is the perpetrator, responding to those with childish whataboutery. In India for example, every crime against a Muslim will be portrayed as communally motivated, while those by Muslims will suppressed or separated from Islam. Their young, impressionable audience, who at this point trusts this person because of their past views, unassumingly believes the narrative and propagates it. Suddenly, you’ve converted a young Liberal mind into a pseudo Islamist. It’s a way of subtle brainwashing and influencing, which has gotten very easy with platforms like Twitter.\n\nIslamists caught onto this very early a decade ago, and built up a great playbook to control the narrative. Basically: \n1. Act liberal and modern to create a solid leftist/liberal platform. \n2. Use that platform to subtly push Islamist views. Your base subconsciously begins equating islamism with liberalism (thus accepting it). \n3. Suffocate all criticism of Islam by abusing charged words like racist, bigot, islamophobic, fascist, that already fit within the liberal culture. So anyone who opposes your Islamist agenda becomes a right wing fascist in the eyes of your liberal following. \n4) slowly Islamize society. At this point you have already destroyed all the mechanisms that could stop Islam through cancel culture, and you have a large audience that has been conditioned to accept Islamic ideas. \n\nBoom. You have the perfect propaganda machine.\n\nThis is why even in places like the US, Islamists are closely linked to liberals in the socio-political realm, even though objectively Islam should be the ideological enemy of any decent liberal movement.

Did you know that Churches own most land in India after agricultural land? Like imagine your village (if you have any), now think that 70% of Indians depend on farming, and that land must be huge, so church only falls short to the agricultural land. Not only that but churches are also occupying lands illegally. Why am I popping a fact out of nowhere? This small fact is the main reason why we agree to choose sides out of only two wings. We simply settle for leaders who are for or against something that we follow.\n\nNow to the main part, my family is fairly educated and from my childhood, I have been listening to DW radio and BBC, it was only a few years back when I realized that they are serving to some higher force. On Twitter, we see numerous news platforms like The (Print, Quint, Scroll, Wire, AltNews), OpIndia, AajTak, NDTV, TimesNow, Swarajya, and many more. \n\nNow I categorize these platforms into three categories. \n\n1. Moneymakers: These are the channels your parents see on TV, they give ads in abundance, they feed you shit in the name of news, and I am not even going to mention their wings, they are simply poor. AajTak, TimesNow, NDTV, Republic, and others come in this category.\n2. Sharp left: This media is definitely serving propaganda and they will prostitute themselves just to prove what they think is right, right. This does not necessarily mean that they are bad, but they didn't inherit any good thing from moneymakers, they just feed you the news that they think is right. They are plainly hypocrites. And you don't even have to look for the hypocrisy.   \nAyaan Hirsi Ali is a fabulous ex-Muslim who is an actual feminist, she once had a group interview with Barkha Dutt, and the shamelessness of Dutt ma'am was beyond the limit. ^(1)  \nRecently her father died, and some people went a little out of their way and reminded her of her own shamelessness for how she shared pics of burning pyres in India. And one might ignore these things for once, but the woman has crossed many limits, from allegedly sharing intel with the Pakistan army of Indian army during wars to defending her lies about the Godhra incident.   \nRecently, leftist media shared some statistics, with orange color representing negative statistics, and one could have easily told about their trick. The media is biased, always has been. But at least the first category had the decency of not falling this low. Remember, Wikipedia which must have been neutral also falls under this category. ^(2)\n3. Practical Media: This is clearly a biased section, this section includes OpIndia. This is how they describe themselves -&gt; News and opinion website that brings you reports and narrative from a perspective often ignored or suppressed by the mainstream media of India.  \nThey are plainly biased. They are right-wing, but they are good because they clearly own it. They don't even lie about being neutral. But this is not bad at all. They say that they are bringing the right side of India to you and they really do that, but often this is considered bad from people who consider themselves as a liberal. They happily accept a hypocritical pill over the truth.   \n\n\nRecently I discovered WionNews, and it is centric but if you watch their videos you would realize that the left was making you hate India, the right was covering up things too. BJP isn't the best government, but please accept that no government can ever be the best government practically. Hate Modi, love Modi, hate Rahul, ~~Love Rahul~~, but remember that you are not a binary person, rapes are bad, Hindus are actually burning in Bengal, Modi govt has actually failed in the second wave, people are responsible for the failure, Maharashtra government is strong-arming small forces against it, and Farmers Protest is only propaganda (I am saying this with 70% of my family being farmers).   \nRemember when India's GDP fell miserably?  \nEvery vulture media house criticized BJP, just some days later came to the news that Modi has handled Corona Virus exceptionally, no leftist media linked these two points. Nobody thought that we are not a country with tech giants as the main income source, so it was natural for us to fall behind. These small points that make you hate the Modi government would be successful only if you're really stupid.\n\nDon't forget that you only grow if you're flexible enough for growth.   \n1: [Barkha being Barkha and thinking Hinduism](https://youtu.be/iYfsiT9r9vo)[ ko bhi le aati hu beech me](https://youtu.be/iYfsiT9r9vo), [Video to show you genuinely what that girl has faced](https://youtu.be/5AkAGc5nOXw)\n\n2. [The String revealing Wikipedia's truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p-qVpm_CHU): Besides remember if you're learning political opinions or religious opinions from  Wikipedia, you are essentially craving for someone's puke. \n\nEven my 13-year-old sister has made 4 edits on Wikipedia.\n\nRemember, criticizing the government is necessary, but whining about everything and ignoring the truth that sits in front of you is not ideal. Our Prime Minister might not be highly educated, but he is a person who has the charisma to win over the largest democracy, and that is what a leader is known for."<br />Author: 'ATV3320'  id: 'n9cthj'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n9cthj/media_bias/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Why are Non Muslims in general so self critical with respect Fundamentalism within their own people while Liberals so steadfast in silence, indifference or in support with respect to Islamic fundamentalism?'<br />Body: 'It does not take a lot to notice that Non Muslims (The Christian West, Buddhist East, Jews and Hindus in that order are on the more tolerant side of the world. \n\nAmerica is called as a racist state day in and day out. Even those who do not call it racist, explain by saying that America has deep structural racism in its society which is not deliberate but takes a toll. \n\nIsrael meanwhile is simply rejected as an apartheid state.  While the reasoning behind this is up for question, this has such a large echo that even naive kids are seen citing it. While I do not understand as to how Apartheid which was based on the concept of racial segregation can be applied to Israel, little do people know or condemn even more virulent Islamic states as apartheid states. \n\nInfact,KSA, Mauritania and Maldives are atleast 3 known states where ONLY MUSLIMS are allowed as citizens and apostasy is punishable. Yet, prominent and influential liberal news houses paint Maldives as a moderate Muslim nation -\n\n&gt;It was governed as a moderate Islamic nation for three decades under the autocratic rule of the former president, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. But after the country made a transition to democracy in 2008, space opened up for greater religious expression, and conservative ideologies like Salafism cropped up.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/world/asia/maldives-islamic-radicalism.html\n\n&gt;Like many details surrounding the Christmas Eve shootings, who destroyed the plinth remains a mystery. But its symbolism seems clear: the moderate Muslim culture of this Saharan state has been penetrated by violence.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritania-security-idUSL1111681920080212\n\nWhile for Saudi Arabia, the state is neither called as an apartheid state, nor is it even criticised as vehemently as Israel is. It is mentioned as an ever existing fundamentalist state in passing reference. \n\nI see a similar approach within Desi Liberals as well. India and Nepal by far are the MOST SECULAR states in South Asia by a long shot, and both majority cultures face an intense amount of criticism from the Liberals and from the majority of the believers as well. \n\nExample is, while the Manusmriti is regularly and rightly recognized as a hate manual in the press (one article criticising the Manu Smriti per week in the Indian Express), just like the Old Testament is criticised in the West, what is interesting to note is that criticism of Islamic texts in the event of a terror attack is almost absent (one odd one out was Tavleen Singh but then she too went silent).\n\nRather, the approach with respect to Hinduism and Islam in the popular press is very different. While Hinduism gets panned and praised in differing amounts (even the praise is conditional with clear riders and mentions of as to how Hinduism gave birth to the Caste System). \n\nHowever the criticism of even fundamentalist Muslims out right is not there, let alone any criticism of Islam in the open. The criticism of fundamentalist Islam is often confined to right wing blogs and right winged individuals on Twitter. However the same right wing individuals are also critical of their own. They regularly vote in and vote out Right wing governments. The BJP wins and loses in equal measure. Parties of all shades come to power in India, voted to power by the Hindus. From the Liberal INC to the Right wing BJP. The Hindus do not swear by a cause. They are ideologically promiscuous. \n\nThis is starkly different when we take the Subcontinent\'s Muslims in to account. A majority of the subcontinent\'s Muslims are pretty straight forward ideologically and tilt towards the right, so much so that the Congress incorporates right wing elements from the community in order to win. The Congress does not incorporate Right wing elements from the majority community in order to win however. It knows that the Hindus vote it for its progressiveness while the Muslims vote it for the presence of right winged leaders in the INC. \n\nDespite all of this, India is routinely panned and is often insinuated to be objectively and surprisingly worse than its more fundamentalist neighbours by Liberals -\n\nhttps://scroll.in/article/982943/minority-places-of-worship-were-attacked-in-india-and-pakistan-guess-which-country-took-action\n\nOfcourse, in the insinuation, it is conveniently forgotten that a country which supposedly cares for its minorities also sponsors terror groups against minorities which are state affiliated. It is also conveniently forgotten that India is a secular country by law and is always rated higher than our neighbour. \n\nWhy ? It is because the only way in which one can promote a while lie is by ignoring a mass reality and in parallel praising an obvious PR stunt aimed at showing as to how "tolerant" Pakistan is, which Pakistan does for crawling back from infamy, as the reflection of a widely held conviction in a deeply religious society. \n\nIt would have been understood if liberals would have merely been unaware or simply unwilling to criticise Islamic fundamentalism. However, it goes beyond that. \n\nLiberals often argue as to how they side with the oppressed minorities, and since Muslims are oppressed minorities, they merely support Muslims against majoritarian tendencies in order to establish secular societies incidentally and not by design. \n\nHowever, how far is this statement true? Do liberals in large Muslim states really safeguard the rights of Non Muslims and stand for secularism ? Let us find it out  -\n\n1. In Iran, Liberal parties voted widely for a Theocratic State which would go on to suppress Non Muslims by siding with Khomeini in ousting the Shah. The Liberals in Iran did not have a problem with Autocracy since they voted for just that in 1979. Rather, they had a problem with Secularism. This is peculiar, since it is seen that Liberals can throw their cause of Secularism out of the window when convenient. What is this convenience for the liberals  ? We shall know it as it comes. \n\n2. In Pakistan, the Liberals (PPP) egged a war which took a religious tone  (1971) and soon after banned the Ahmedis. \n\n3. In Lebanon, when the newly immigrated Muslims asserted in order to gain a larger amount of power in Lebanon, the Left openly sided with the Muslim militias and engaged in gory massacres of Christians. Note - The Christians had already become a minority by then. \n\n4. In Turkey, the father of the Turkish Islamist movement Mili Gorus shared power with the CHP as the deputy prime minister. The "Secular" Ataturk himself initiated attacks against the Christians while his army was fighting against the Greeks. \n\nIn fact, When a Liberal says that he or she condemns Islamic fundamentalism, have you ever seen him or her give a standalone statement  ? The way in which they condemn the RSS or KKK  ? Of course not. They will be quick to atleast mention RSS and White Nationalism twice while they condemn ISIS. They will equate ISIS to RSS (Nope, they do not and will not equate the RSS with say that Muslim League, the Muslim league is secular for them). They will offer only conditional condemnations which are vague and general. \n\n\nTo be honest, even I used to think that Liberals condemn Islamic fundamentalism in the same way they condemn other forms of Fundamentalism. However, ever seen Liberals in secular Muslim democracies states vouch for Secularism in the same gusto as they do it in the Non Muslim majority states  ? Before you give examples of Indonesia or Turkey, hear me out  - \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_criminal_law_in_Aceh\n\nhttps://www.mfa.gov.tr/OIC_en.en.mfa\n\nBoth, Turkey and Indonesia have openly identified with religion. Not only it, they have gone a step further and have rejected the UNDHR as a Judeo Christian and have offered imposition of Shariat as a move towards religious tolerance. Turkey and Indonesia have been members of the OIC throughout the rule of Liberal Parties and Islamist parties. However, neither of them have opposed the OIC. \n\nWhere is any other equivalent of the OIC  ? Is there an OCC  ? OBC  ? OHC  ? How many Liberal parties in Muslim majority states have opposed the inclusion of their countries into the OIC because it might be an affront to Secularism  ? 0. \n\n\nSo think once again. Why do you think that the Liberals have their scales biased against the Non Muslims  ? Why do liberals stay silent or are somewhat cooperative wrt to Islamists while being openly hostile to even center right Non Muslim parties  ?'<br />Author: 'normienahi'  id: 'n9c3vx'<br />Score:166<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n9c3vx/why_are_non_muslims_in_general_so_self_critical/</li>

Let\'s analyse their 2021 report card:\n\n1. Vasooli-Gate: Huge corruption scandal. The Police Commissioner of Mumbai alleges that the 2nd highest ranking person in the Govt, the Home Minister, was running a large extortion racket in the MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Businesses were already struggling with the financial impact of COVID, and here the State Govt. was openly using the Police to blackmail and extort money from them. It cannot get worse than this: how shamelessly corrupt do you have to be to do this during a pandemic, and then how incompetent do you have to be that your own Police commissioner ends up exposing you? You have entirely undermined the police force of the state, and abused State power in the worst possible way. This is the scandal of a decade, one that would topple any Government if the media was independent and unbiased. \n\n2. Ambani Bomb scare: A senior cop, who is also an ex-Shiv Sena politician (and very close to UT), is caught planting a bomb outside the house of the richest man in the country. Closely related to the Vasooli-gate, but unclear how exactly. Either ways, it is absolutely impossible for someone so close to the State Govt, who is a very senior member of the State police force, to do something as outrageous as this without high-level support from the senior MVA politicians. Doesn\'t help that parts of the MVA (RaGa) spent 50% of 2020 directly attacking the Ambani\'s in the media. Either way, a terrible indictment of the law &amp; order/state of Governance in Maharashtra.\n\nThese 2 incidents are bad enough that every single media organization/political commentator should have been clamoring for the resignation of the State Govt. Can you imagine if this happened in UP? If a corruption scandal like this involving the UP Home Minister was exposed, can you imagine the Universal outrage? Every single media headline/tweet in the country the next day would have been calling for Yogi\'s resignation, and the WaPo and NYT would have written cover articles on the incompetence/corruption etc. \n\nInstead, with the MVA hardly anyone besides the BJP questioned Uddhav or the incompetence of the Govt in general, instead they only scapegoated the individuals directly involved (Waze, Deshmukh). "Liberals" and "Leftists" who speak "truth to power" were nowhere to be found. Bollywood celebrities were busy tweeting "#UddhavBestCM". Nothing to see here guys, just your average day of cognitive dissonance and propaganda in India.\n\n3. But we\'re not done! Right in the middle of this once in a decade fiasco, something even worse was brewing up. Covid cases began rising, but the State Govt, too busy extorting the common man and planting bombs, paid no attention to it. While the rest of the country basically returned to normalcy, Maharashtra suddenly began setting all-time COVID records. Most cases in a day, Most deaths in a day, Highest positivity rate; name the record, and it belonged to Maharashtra. In March, Maharashtra had more cases than the rest of the country combined. For more than a month, March to April 8th, the MVA did absolutely nothing to control the spread of the virus. The virus decimated the Vidharbha region and Mumbai suffered for a long period as well. During this period, instead of cooperating, the MVA was busy playing politics with the Centre, blaming the wave on vaccine shortage instead of its incompetence. It used the vaccine shortage narrative to avoid taking tough decisions. By the 8th of April, when it finally enforced a strict lockdown, the State had already been recording 15-60k cases per day for a month, and the virus had had enough time to freely spread outside the State as well.\n\nSo, the story of the MVA over the last 3 months has been disaster after disaster after disaster. I cannot recall a State Govt. ever embarrassing itself/displaying its incompetence so many times in such a short time period. Yet, we got 0 Op-Eds, 0 polemic articles by intellectuals/"journalists\' attacking the Govt., relatively very little outrage on Social Media by the same people attacking (for example) the UP Govt right now. The only people pointing it out were BJP supporters. Today, these shameless people are instead PRAISING the MVA. The sheer audacity. They have been the worst Govt. in the country by every single metric, yet there is 0 accountability. Nobody wants to "speak truth to power" and "hold our leaders accountable" suddenly. I\'m getting repetitive at this point, but please imagine if this was a BJP state with this same report card, we would never hear the end of it.

      <li>Title::: "The Impact of Propaganda Part 2: Maharashtra's 2021 report card and the Leftist/Media Coverup"<br />Body: 'The Maha Vikas Agadhi, consisting of the NCP, Shiv Sena, and Congress, has quite possibly gone through the most embarrassing 3 months in the history of State governance. Let\'s analyse their 2021 report card: \n\n1) Vasooli-Gate: Huge corruption scandal. The Police Commissioner of Mumbai alleges that the 2nd highest ranking person in the Govt, the Home Minister, was running a large extortion racket in the MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Businesses were already struggling with the financial impact of COVID, and here the State Govt. was openly using the Police to blackmail and extort money from them. It cannot get worse than this: how shamelessly corrupt do you have to be to do this during a pandemic, and then how incompetent do you have to be that your own Police commissioner ends up exposing you? You have entirely undermined the police force of the state, and abused State power in the worst possible way. This is the scandal of a decade, one that would topple any Government if the media was independent and unbiased. \n\n2) Ambani Bomb scare: A senior cop, who is also an ex-Shiv Sena politician (and very close to UT), is caught planting a bomb outside the house of the richest man in the country. Closely related to the Vasooli-gate, but unclear how exactly. Either ways, it is absolutely impossible for someone so close to the State Govt, who is a very senior member of the State police force, to do something as outrageous as this without high-level support from the senior MVA politicians. Doesn\'t help that parts of the MVA (RaGa) spent 50% of 2020 directly attacking the Ambani\'s in the media. Either way, a terrible indictment of the law &amp; order/state of Governance in Maharashtra. \n\nThese 2 incidents are bad enough that every single media organization/political commentator should have been clamoring for the resignation of the State Govt. Can you imagine if this happened in UP? If a corruption scandal like this involving the UP Home Minister was exposed, can you imagine the Universal outrage? Every single media headline/tweet in the country the next day would have been calling for Yogi\'s resignation, and the WaPo and NYT would have written cover articles on the incompetence/corruption etc. Instead, with the MVA hardly anyone besides the BJP questioned Uddhav or the incompetence of the Govt in general, instead they only scapegoated the individuals directly involved (Waze, Deshmukh). "Liberals" and "Leftists" who speak "truth to power" were nowhere to be found. Bollywood celebrities were busy tweeting "#UddhavBestCM". Nothing to see here guys, just your average day of cognitive dissonance and propaganda in India. \n\nBut we\'re not done! Right in the middle of this once in a decade fiasco, something even worse was brewing up. Covid cases began rising, but the State Govt, too busy extorting the common man and planting bombs, paid no attention to it. While the rest of the country basically returned to normalcy, Maharashtra suddenly began setting all-time COVID records. Most cases in a day, Most deaths in a day, Highest positivity rate; name the record, and it belonged to Maharashtra. In March, Maharashtra had more cases than the rest of the country combined. For more than a month, March to April 8th, the MVA did absolutely nothing to control the spread of the virus. The virus decimated the Vidharbha region and Mumbai suffered for a long period as well. During this period, instead of cooperating, the MVA was busy playing politics with the Centre, blaming the wave on vaccine shortage instead of its incompetence. It used the vaccine shortage narrative to avoid taking tough decisions. By the 8th of April, when it finally enforced a strict lockdown, the State had already been recording 15-60k cases per day for a month, and the virus had had enough time to freely spread outside the State as well. \n\nSo, the story of the MVA over the last 3 months has been disaster after disaster after disaster. I cannot recall a State Govt. ever embarrassing itself/displaying its incompetence so many times in such a short time period. Yet, we got 0 Op-Eds, 0 polemic articles by intellectuals/"journalists\' attacking the Govt., relatively very little outrage on Social Media by the same people attacking (for example) the UP Govt right now. The only people pointing it out were BJP supporters. Today, these shameless people are instead PRAISING the MVA. The sheer audacity. I\'m getting repetitive at this point, but please imagine if this was a BJP state with this same report card, we would never hear the end of it. The Propaganda and Cognitive dissonance is getting out of hand.'<br />Author: 'itiswhatitis2323'  id: 'n8vx03'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n8vx03/the_impact_of_propaganda_part_2_maharashtras_2021/</li>

I have encountered many instances where I am able to find a verified lead but the amount/money they are asking is way beyond the needy persons reach. I feel helplessness, out of my pocket I helped few people but thats not enough. I thought of running a fund raiser on these online sites but almost all of them have a condition that raised money can only be transferred to the hospital or some healthcare provider account and adding to this, as the purpose of this fund is to give immediate help to anyone and everyone who is genuinely short of money. I dont know anyone of these people nor i know the leads who are going to provide these items. So realistically I cannot provide any direct account details and moreover the amount also differs. From few thousand to a lakhs (incase of multiple injection). \n\nSo suggest me what should I do. I am restless as one to person called me for injection in evening and when I told me the lead, he was short of money and few minutes back, he told me that his family member died.\n\nMy personal finance is limited and I try to help as much as I can but i need more funds. \n\nSo plz suggest what should I do?'<br />Author: 'swami_rara'  id: 'n8nvm7'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/n8nvm7/suggestions_and_help_needed_covid/</li>

But then I read the report and saw that they compared the active cases on 31st march which were 1863 and active cases on 24th April which stood at 33,300. This was called an 1800% jump by them. \n\nNow let me tell you why I called this cherry-picked. Let us look at other states which didn\'t have Kumbh Mela. \n\nNote: I am using the same dates as they used (31th March to 24th April) and not picking up comfortable dates to make my point.\n\nExhibit 1: Odisha\n\nActive Cases increased from 1852 to 39,840 \\~ 2050% change\n\nPicked up a state which had similar numbers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExhibit 2: Rajasthan \n\nActive Cases increased from 8663 to 1,27,616 \\~ 1370% change\n\nNow, it is not fair to compare like this because even though the numbers are bad, the percentage change doesn\'t seem that much. The state was already performing poorly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExhibit 3: Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Lakshadweep, Mizoram\n\nArunachal: From 4 to 550 active cases \\~ 13,650% increase\n\nMeghalaya: From 49 to 1244 active cases \\~ 2438% increase\n\nLakshadweep: From 42 to 1044 active cases \\~ 2385% increase\n\nMizoram: From 28 to 634 active cases \\~ 2164% increase\n\nI added these States/UT to establish the point I made above. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have calculated this for all states/UT.

Today, Javed Akhtar, eminent secularist and intellectual, claimed that the rest of India needed to ‘learn a lesson or 2’ from the MVA, which has handled the pandemic with ‘tremendous competence’. \n\nSo the State that has done the worst is now apparently the most competent, only because the Opposition is in charge.
