      <li>Title::: 'Have you heard of Thernaos and its Indian connection?'<br />Body: 'For some of you that may have been looking at the tech world of Silicon Valley for the last 10-15 years, or even the last month, you may have heard of a company called Theranos (short for "Therapeutic Diagnostics"), whose executives Elizabeth Homles and Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani are currently being tried in court in the US for fraud. For those of you that haven\'t heard of it, read on, and then keep reading to see its Indian connection.\n\n# Elizabeth Holmes\n\nElizabeth Holmes was born in 1984 into a fairly wealthy American family (not crazy wealthy but quite well off). Her father, Christian Holmes IV, was a high level executive at Enron before the company went bankrupt (the Enron scandal made ripples in India too). After high school, she was admitted to Stanford\'s Chemical Engineering undergraduate programme. However, she soon proved to be far too ambitious for a formal education and training. At Stanford, she worked as an undergraduate assistant helping a PhD student named Shaunak Roy, who was born to Indian immigrants in Chicago. His research was on microfluidics, an exciting field that studies fluid properties and reactions at extremely low speeds and tiny volumes. \n\nAfter her first year, Elizabeth came up with the idea of a "smart patch" - a skin patch that would painlessly conduct an in-situ blood test on patients wearing it, figure out the right dosage of a drug to administer, and also administer that drug through the skin. Nice idea, except that it was physically impossible as per a Stanford medical professor that she discussed it with. This rejection didn\'t stop Holmes, who filed a provisional patent application within a week. Apparently in the US, you can file patents for "inventions" that haven\'t even been invented yet. This was the beginning of Holmes\' obsession with medical devices and revolutionizing them through what seems like (and was) science fiction. This was also about the time when the aura around Steve Jobs of the iPhone fame was being constructed, and everyone in Silicon Valley wanted to be the next messiah of technology.\n\nAfter Shaunak graduated, Elizabeth decided to drop out of Stanford at age 19. They co-founded a new company, Theranos, to combine Elizabeth\'s "vision" with Shaunak\'s background in microfluidics. The aim was to build a *consumer* device that could conduct hundreds of blood tests at home through a tiny pinprick on the finger - think a glucometer but in the world of *Star Trek*. For funding, Elizabeth tapped into her family\'s social network to get wealthy individuals to invest. She also started building a Steve Jobs like persona to "impress" people - wearing similar clothes, adopting similar catchphrases, and allegedly faking a deep baritone. \n\nTheranos created a new device called the Edison that tried to do what Holmes had claimed - conduct a large number of blood tests with a single drop of blood. For those of you who don\'t know, blood testing usually involves extracting a fairly large amount of blood intravenously, and this is especially difficult for cancer patients as they have to get tested regularly. Veins collapsing because of being poked too often by needles is unfortunately fairly common for such patients. So her vision certainly had some merit - and that\'s what enthralled a lot of old, rich, white men that chose to invest in her start-up. However, the device was never anything more than a prototype, and Elizabeth never had the patience or knowledge to go into the details with her engineers. As far as she was concerned, a prototype *was* a product!\n\n# Sunny Balwani\n\nSunny Balwani was born in 1965 to Sindhi Hindu parents in Pakistan. The family briefly moved to India and then immigrated to the US. He received an undergraduate degree in Information System at the University of Texas at Austin, where he chose to be a member of the Pakistani Students Association. During the dot com bubble, he became wealthy by founding CommerceBid, an early B2B online company that was sold to another company, Commerce One. Balwani netted $40m by selling stock in 2000 shortly before the company went bankrupt in the dot com crash. He went on to get an MBA from UC Berkeley and tried to obtain a CS degree from Stanford, but ultimately dropped out. He had no formal training in chemistry, biology, chemical engineering, or medicine of any kind. \n\nHowever, he did meet Elizabeth and at some point, started dating her and eventually had her move into his apartment (he was 37 when she was 18). He joined Theranos as COO, where he handled day to day operations, literally standing over the shoulders of engineers and chemists. He quickly developed a reputation for being a man-child, often shouting and cursing at employees and firing them for minor infractions or no reason at all. Elizabeth never objected, in fact she also had the habit of firing anyone who disagreed with her, claiming that they didn\'t believe in her "vision". The pair also insisted that employees work weekends and at odd hours to prove their "loyalty". Sunny and Elizabeth never disclosed their relationship to the board of Theranos, which at one point consisted of some of the most famous people on the planet, ranging from Henry Kissinger to Jim Mattis, who never seemed to have asked either.\n\nBalwani\'s anger seemed to stem from two things. First, Theranos\' Edison device never worked properly. Under him, the company dropped its device and started creating a new one, dubbed the 4S (after the iPhone - she *really* wanted to be Steve Jobs reincarnate), on the "vision" of miniaturizing laboratory equipment: a huge fall from microfluidics, but still something (Shaunak left the company at this point since his expertise wasn\'t needed). Second, Balwani had no formal training in the field, but kept faking it in painfully obvious ways. Former engineers allege that he kept repeating jargon that he had heard, or rather misheard, and blamed the engineers for not being able to translate his so-called ideas into an actual product. He often screamed at employees that he was "incredibly wealthy" and "a billionaire" (he wasn\'t), and therefore they should follow his orders. In fact, this fake it till you make it culture soon seeped into the rest of Thernaos.\n\n# The Indian Connection\n\nBalwani wasn\'t the only one faking it - everyone was. Holmes regularly told investors that the product could do anything with 100% accuracy, although Healthcare-focused investors as well as Pharma companies never bought into it. All her investments came from wealthy individuals and families who wanted to "believe" that she was the next Steve Jobs - and it worked. Thernaos eventually had a valuation of $9 bn on total investor funding of about $1 bn, with Holmes having a $4.6 bn valuation herself. She was invited to the White House, then VP Joe Biden visited the Theranos office, she even campaigned for Hillary Clinton! All that while never publishing a single peer-reviewed publication in a reputed journal, obtaining any kind of regulatory clearance for her devices, or even discussing how exactly her company had overcome the laws of Physics to build its product. In fact, they never had any product that worked - it was all a lie. They lied about their tests, their test results to patients and doctors, their regulatory submissions, their deals with pharma companies and pharmacies, their deal with the US military (there was none, but they claimed to investors that their device was being used in Afghanistan and Iraq during combat), their financials (it was a $9 bn company without a CFO!), and who knows what else.\n\nBut that was Balwani and Holmes lying through their teeth. What about the employees? As I wrote previously, Balwani and Holmes fired people regularly when they brought up issues with the device and test results. Employees were the ones who were being asked to fake the most important part of it - from cherry-picking quality control data to diluting samples to secretly running tests on third-party devices, and even creating a piece of software that made it look like the device was working when in fact it was not. Remember, these test results were used by doctors to treat patients, it\'s not an app that downloads porn. Plenty of employees objected and were fired. So how did the company keep going?\n\nThat\'s where the H1B visa comes in. A disproportionately large proportion of Theranos\' workforce was Indian (not Indian-American, though there were many of them too) - people who came for grad school to the US and then continued to work on the H1B visa. Theranos, a start-up working out of one location, had no CFO, and with a COO that was free enough to hover over engineers in the lab, had 123 employees on H1B visas in total, almost all from India. For those that don\'t know, the visa is tied to the employer: if you\'re fired, you have to sell everything you own and leave the country with your spouse and kids in a few days. In his book *Bad Blood*, John Carreyrou, a Wall Street Journal reporter who blew the lid on the entire scam, claims that Balwani liked having the H1B employees because they never complained about the fraudulent practices or his own abusive style, and moreover, were quite willing to work on weekends and put in long hours. The book describes him as having a "master-slave" management style, similar to some older Indian businessmen (Carreyrou\'s words, not mine). \n\n# The End\n\nUltimately, Theranos\' web of lies came apart when whistleblowers (who were not from the H1B crowd) started contacting journalists and regulators. The company initially used brutal legal tactics to suppress them, but once even doctors started complaining about poor results, regulators stepped in and put a stop to it. The company went bankrupt in 2018 and Holmes\' personal valuation was revised from $4.6 bn to zero in two years. Tellingly, she and Balwani are currently being sued for fraud by all the investors who never questioned the fact that the company never released proper financial statements (they had no CFO!), never answered any technical questions about their technology, never even showed their actual devices to investors, but just kept (successfully) pushing its "vision" through a rather charismatic CEO. Theranos never got a dime from actual companies in the med-tech field, including specialized VCs, but no less than Joe Biden declared it to be a revolution. \n\nBalwani and Holmes allegedly broke up their long and open-secret relationship soon after the scandal broke out. She also stopped dressing up like Steve Jobs after becoming the subject of online ridicule for it. Her trial is currently on, and Balwani\'s will happen next year.\n\nI\'ll leave you with two thoughts to chew on:\n\n1. With the start-up culture also firmly in place in India, do we have a Theranos baking somewhere here? Are there checks and balances on ethics and integrity in Bangalore? Remember, fintech is the big thing in India, and money is second only to health for families. To what extent is the Steve Jobs syndrome (cult-like persona driving a product) present here?\n2. Is the H1B system a form of modern slavery? Indians are by far the largest recipients of H1B visas.

We must be cordial and respectful of the other persons beliefs. But mockery is subjective, even if I make a small question about Nehru or Modi, their follower feels offended.

Do you know that USA(27), AUSTRALIA(28), MEXICO(13), SWEDEN(63), UK(24), FINLAND(15), IRELAND(10), NORWAY(19), BELGIUM(28), NEWZEALAND(25) have higher  R*pe statistics than INDIA(1.8)? But why don't people have negative point of views about these countries? This is because no one from their country goes around the world to tell how their country's girls are gangra*ed. In 2010 India's r*pe statistics were measures to be 0.45 per 100000 population, which is one of the least in the world.

      <li>Title::: 'Is Ivermectin the reason India prevented a third wave?'<br />Body: "Disclaimer: I fully believe in vaccines and I am double vaccinated myself. I believe vaccines are the best bet to solve this pandemic and I hate those who don't take vaccines and insist on freedom of choice. There was somebody posting here yesterday promoting an anti-vaccine mandate protest march at India Gate. I am fully against that and not affiliated with him. If a drug prevents COVID-19, that's good, but it's not an excuse not to get vaccinated.\n\nIs Ivermectin the reason India has not had a third wave? I was searching for Indian content creators on Odysee when I found a video from a pro-Trump channel. [One America News] (https://odysee.com/@OzFlor:7/wv:1) claims that Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, was able to avert crisis and bring down infection rates to 200 as of the end of September by administering ivermectin to everyone including children, in the preceding months. By comparison, the USA had 130,000 cases on September 30. Uttar Pradesh is highly populated and it's not possible to follow social distancing always. So how did they do it?\n\nJoe Rogan made a video claiming ivermectin helped him to recover from COVID-19. The MSM critcised him for it and said he was using a drug for horses even though they have always been used in humans. CNN even reported a fake news that emergency wards in some redneck state (redneck - bigoted person from rural America) were full of people that became hospitalised after taking the drug. That was exposed as fake news.\n\nThere is a video from [Dr. Lenny DaCosta from Goa, India] (https://odysee.com/@AussieFighter:8/India-Ivermectin-saved-the-day:b) who claims that his doctor colleagues take Ivermectin once a week since March 2020 and none of them got COVID-19 despite constant exposure to positive cases in the hospitals. He claims UP was able to bring down the case rate from 60,000 to 15,000 in one and a half months. I also found a video by a Pakistani doctor based in California, Dr. Mobeen, who explains the [mechanism of ivermectin] (https://odysee.com/@DrMobeenSyed:1/Ivermectin:7d).\n \nOur experts were predicting a devastating third wave by September or October. That hasn't happened yet. So what happened?\n\nWe must take vaccines, I am not denying that. Vaccines greatly increase the chance of survival and reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. Everybody must take it. But if I were to get COVID-19, should I take ivermectin? How easy is it to get it in India or abroad? What about if it's for my parents?"<br />Author: 'suddenwo0'  id: 'qwjwm9'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qwjwm9/is_ivermectin_the_reason_india_prevented_a_third/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The one widely misunderstood thing that makes Hinduism so special.'<br />Body: "\n\n\n\nI think it was Sadhguru who said that Yoga is not a philosophy,\xa0 it's a process. I want to expand on that and say that the whole of Hinduism is a process and not a philosophy. \n\nWe believe in multiple paths to realization.\xa0 And all of these paths are recorded meticulously. And not just recorded, we broke these paths down for even the commoner to grasp easily through simple processes. We call it sadhana. The person who practices it is called a sadhaka. And there is a process for anyone and everyone, no matter what you believe in. \n\n\n**You think that love towards Krishna is realization?** No matter. We have a process for that so that you can realize it. We give you a japa mala and that initiates your sadhana. \n\n**You deny the presence of God itself and think you are God?** No matter, we believe that too. That's why we bow down to every person with a namaskaram. \n\n**You want to achieve realization by doing nothing but just breathing?** Done. We call it pranayama. Just learn kumbhakapaddhiti. It's a process to achieve realization through breathing and nothing else. \n\n**You don't think there is a male God but think that God is a female?** Shaktism is for you. A complete process in itself. \n\n**You are a Persian who worships fire?** What a coincidence! We perform yagna in our rituals too. We have a codified process for those rituals. \n\n**You are a sun worshipping Inca from south America?** We worship Savitri too! \n\n**You are a native American who worships plants and animals and nature?** Bro we have Ganesha, Garuda, Hanuman,\xa0 Vayu etc etc. Just last week I married a tree. \n\n**You are a very ritualistic person who enjoys proper system of worship?** We will teach you Sandhyavandanam first then we move to other advanced processes. \n\n**You don't want to think about anything, or anyone and still achieve realization?** Shoonya and vipassana. \n\n**You just want to sing and dance and eat your way to enlightenment?** Have at it! We have dance forms of Bharatnatyam, kathak etc. to deepen your sadhana to dance. Carnatic classical music has come from the tradition of singing devotional songs for the Brahman. And as to eating, you can enjoy prasadam. \n\n**You want to give up everything and become a renunciate loner?** We have many processes for that too. Buddhism is an offshoot of one of them. \n\n**You don't want to give anything up and earn a lot of wealth?** No problem. We do not demonize wealthy people. We rather admire them thinking that it is a blessing from Lakshmi herself. There are prescriptions in the puranas to become wealthy and accumulate fame. \n\n**You think you are the son of God himself and are born again?** Hey that's reincarnation and welcome to India, the ashram that believes that they are children of God is aage se left then seedha. \n\n**You think that there is only one God and one book and are very dogmatic about it?** Very well, we have mlecchas here too. \n\n**You don't want to go through the path of Vedas at all and don't like them?** Well, we have nastikas too who have realized the Brahman without them too. They have their schools too. \n\n**You love the vedas and want to achieve realization only through them?** No problem! We have entire clans named after people who did just that - Dwivedis, Trivedis, Chaturvedis. \n\n**You want to make up your own God and worship him/her?** Dew it. Ishtha Devatas to your rescue. \n\nHell,\xa0 we have temples dedicated to Ravana too. You can even take the path of Tamas to realize the truth. The realization himself/herself will take birth to deliver you personally by ending you. \n\n##The pluralism in Hinduism is not about the multiple amount of Gods we worship. It's about the multiple amount of processes we have incorporated into daily life. \n\nEvery one of these processes were divined by normal ordinary men and women like you and me through sadhana. And they made it available for everyone to practice. No subscription is really needed. No gatekeeping.\n\nEvery one of the processes present in our culture can be practiced anywhere, even at home. You do not have to go to a temple or a school or ashram either. The only thing it demands is sadhana from the sadhaka, and seva where you cannot afford to pay dakshina. \n\nThis is what other religions are so insecure about. There are no commandments or dogma tying anyone down. You can come and choose whichever path you wish. \n\nIf you do not like it, you can leave too, without any death threats, whenever you want. So many have left, even for as little as a bag of food grain. \n\nWhen you get so much freedom in the real sense and proper processes to achieve realization that is not bound to a single book or entity, in today's world of educated individuals, of course this will be more appealing. \n\nThats what they are afraid of. That people will realize what true inclusion really is.\xa0 That's why they malign us. \n\nBecause in Bharat, every person is given the opportunity to become a God. That's why say namaskaram to every human being. We bow down to the Brahman inside them. Where else will you see such a practice of showing respect? \n\nPranam."<br />Author: 'Critavarma'  id: 'qwhxz6'<br />Score:65<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qwhxz6/the_one_widely_misunderstood_thing_that_makes/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Today I learnt, uk and us have higher rape cases reported than India per year. Why is India more unsafe?'<br />Body: "\n\nThanks to the vir das controversy, I learnt that number of rape cases in uk/us are way more than India, and even worse at rate per 100,000. The reference I used was statistica.com and because 2020 was entirely a lockdown, for India I am referring to year 2019.\n\nFor 2019 rape cases reported in India was 38,000\n\nFor uk it was 55000\n\nFor us it was 120,000+\n\nAnd that's the total rate. That's the number of cases reported. When we reduce these numbers per population, they turn out to be way worse. With us population 330 million and uk at 60 million, us has 9x and uk has 28x the number of rape per population compared to India\n\nNow let's discuss some factors that can affect the numbers.\n\nFirstly the definition of rape is different in different countries. Sweden for example has a much broader definition of sexual assault. For example in Sweden, a sexual assault without the use of force/violence is also considered a sexual assault. And because of this, conviction rate rose to 75%\n\nSo lets discuss some rape exceptions according to Indian rules.\n\nRape in Indian constitution is limited to penetration of penis into her body parts. \n\nRape is an explicit act of man doing to a women. Any cases of men rape are expelled already. This is the point where we are different from uk and the us, where rape is universal. \n\n(Well I picked all that on Wikipedia, and yeah, it's specifically rape I am talking about here, so don't get your ass hyped about groping and stuff, I am sure it comes under something, but not rape)\n\nOne in every 10 cases are male victims, so thats 110% of 38,000 making it 41800. Still, we are way ahead.\n\nSecond, and arguably more important, conviction rate. The number of cases where the assaulter is actually given a punishment. In India, the conviction rate is 23% which is way higher when compared to uk and us. Uk stands at 1.6% and in America 57 out of 1000 assaulters are actually arrested. Now there are number of reasons why conviction rate can be low. From false accusations to lack of evidence. \n\nWhen we play these numbers, uk and the us have twice the number of convicted criminals per population. And despite this, you are much more likely to be convicted for raping a woman in India than in us or uk.\n\nAre we still unsafe for you whites? Well I don't think so. \n\nIt's the media of our nation that has put this image in our minds, but reality is, most of the Indians do know to stay in their limits. Information can be presented to you just to in a way that it looks way more disheartening than it actually is\n\n That's not to say we are ahead of anyone. Ideal number or rape cases is 0 and we should be working towards that. There are people who do need to learn the concept of consent, and we should be more aggressive towards it more than ever now. \n\n#and I always recommend to check the numbers yourself.

Maid agency owners reveal horror stories | 2017'<br />Body: '*(Published: April 2017)*\n\nThe recent move by a housekeeping service provider to ban Bollywood celebrities from its client list has blown the lid off how these employers treat their domestic help. Speaking to various service provider agencies, we find that the stories range from waking the cook up with a kick to withholding their salary because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not enough work‚Äù.\n\nThe maids sometimes report this to their agencies. The agency owners try to take this up. The celebrity clients pull strings or issue threats. The police are of no help. And going by what several agency owners say, it‚Äôs the women celebs who mistreat their staff more than the men do.\n\n**An agency owner** who wishes to remain anonymous says, ‚ÄúAlone, I can‚Äôt raise my voice. If four-five agencies come together and ask for my opinion, then I will speak out. But if I do it on my own, I‚Äôll create problems for myself.‚Äù\n\n**Abhishek Sable**, director at Happy Maids Service, says, ‚ÄúI have stopped taking contracts from Bollywood. In the beginning, around three years ago, I provided house help to five-six celebrities. In my experience, only a few celebs are good. The others never gave [the maids] decent food. And if they didn‚Äôt like the food that the cook had made, they would throw the plate at their face. Gaali toh unke mooh pe rehti thi."\n\n‚ÄúThey would come home late at night and wake the cook up with a kick and tell them to cook [right then]. We tried going to the police, but to no avail. One actor falsely accused a maid of theft. When I took her to the police, she contacted some minister and the case was dismissed. One Marathi [female] actor also had problems with the caste of the staff. She said she didn‚Äôt want people from the Ambedkar caste as, in her opinion, they are dirty. She threatened me with murder and also called a minister.‚Äù\n\n**Mohit Yadav**, Honest Enterprises, says, ‚ÄúSo far, I haven‚Äôt got any case of physical abuse, but [the celebs] threaten and abuse the staff. They keep the staff awake till very late. In the contract, I give it to them in writing that I won‚Äôt be responsible if a household help quits for being abused or ill-treated, nor will I provide a replacement. Many times, the servants don‚Äôt even report these incidents to us, as the employers take big names and threaten them. Mostly, bigger stars contact us through their secretaries, but television actors directly contact us. If I don‚Äôt like their behaviour or attitude when meeting them, I refuse [the service].‚Äù \n\n**Another service provider**, on condition of anonymity, says, ‚ÄúJust recently, I got a query from a Bollywood actor for two domestic helps ‚Äî one for looking after the dog, the other to take care of the upper floor. They quoted a salary of Rs 12,000 each. I sent one person to their house, but when it was time to pay the salary, they only paid Rs 8,000, saying, ‚ÄòWe have a lot of staff, but very few people to be taken care of‚Äô. It all depends on their mood; if they don‚Äôt like a maid‚Äôs services, they deduct an entire month‚Äôs salary. When we say we‚Äôll approach the police, they retaliate by saying they‚Äôre not scared. The police are of no help. These instances are not just restricted to big stars; even struggling actors, models and television actors do it.‚Äù \n\n**Anupam Singhal**, co-founder of Book My Bai and writer of the blog post exposing the celebs, says, ‚ÄúWe provide over 2,000 maids in a month. We‚Äôve provided help to around 35 celebrities, out of which around 26 such cases have come to me. [The maid] has placed her trust in us and my responsibility is to get her a good job at a good household. And when I know my experience with Bollywood celebrities has been bad, I have no reason to get her a job there. I also have examples where the celebrity has taken very good care of the maids. But in the majority of the cases, some sort of abuse or exploitation has happened. We have a few pending requests from celebrities that we‚Äôre turning down now.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inhuman to have physical abuse, verbal abuse, economic abuse. Maids are not paid salaries for months together. That‚Äôs the reason I came out and wrote the blog, because many of them are role models, some even National Award winners."\n\n‚ÄúIf I take a name, the celebrity slaps a defamation case against [our] company. The maid should stand next to me and say that she‚Äôll go to the police and file a case. Otherwise, I would have nothing to prove. Most of these maids refrain from going to the police because they say they‚Äôve come here to earn money and not get into legal hassles. There‚Äôs a social stigma about what their families will think.‚Äù\n\n**Another service provider**, on condition of anonymity, says, ‚ÄúAn incident took place at an actor‚Äôs house. She is divorced with two children and comes from a family of actors. Who maid ko time pe khaana nahi dete the. Whatever was left over from their parties, they‚Äôd feed her that. We can‚Äôt leave the maids in such conditions. These things happen with stars. Hum zyada inn logo ka kaam nahi lete hain, kyuki inke complaints aate rehte hain. They also create problems with salary ‚Äî they feel that people are dying to work at their houses, so they can decide what they want to pay.‚Äù\n\n_* * * * *_\n\n**Why did BookMyBai put a blanket-ban on providing a maid to Bollywood celebrities** \n\nAnupam Singhal, co-founder of Book My Bai, decided to put a blanket ban on Bollywood celebrities as his clients.\n\nHere\'s the excerpts from his blog, where he lists out some examples of harassment and abuse meted out to domestic help:\n\n**Celebrity 1**\n\nShe came to us looking for a male helper at a budget of Rs. 4000 per month! This is even lower than the minimum wage of Maharashtra. We refused and told her that we wont be able to provide a helper in this budget (wonder where does all the money go which earns through her movies). After a lot of negotiation she finally agreed upon Rs.10000 per month (which was still on the lower side considering she has a 4-bhk home and the helper needed to clean the home 6 times everyday! Yes- 6 times!) ‚Äì We went ahead and provided the helper and all was going well. \n\nUnfortunately the mother of the helper passed away. The helper was from Bihar and he wanted to go back to Bihar to perform the last rituals. He promised to be back after 15 days since he wanted the money to support his family. The ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù called us and told us that she wont let the person go till the time we send in a replacement. This was at 5.45pm on a Saturday evening. Our office is shut on Sundays. We promised to send a replacement on Monday and requested her to release the helper since he has to go for his mothers last ritual. Guess what! She did not. She could not care less. We did give a replacement on Monday. But the helper missed out on her mothers last ritual. I have no words to the extent of disgust I now have for this lady\n\n**Celebrity 2**\n\nShe is a unique case altogether. She has a huge home in Mumbai suburbs and she hired a maid through us. BookMyBai has a 6-month replacement clause with the employers which means that if any domestic help leaves within the first 6-months, then we would provide a free replacement. The extent of torture and harassment to the maids was so high that we replaced maids 7 times. Each maid worked for 7-10 days before giving up and quitting. She drives a 3 crore car. Doesn‚Äôt give food to her domestic help. NO FOOD!!! Really!! Drink tea and eat bread 3 times a day. Wow!\n\nFinally we gave the full-refund to the lady since she threatened us that her brother will send in a few bouncers to our office and ‚Äúfix‚Äù us up. I didn‚Äôt want this atmosphere in my office and chose to part ways\n\n**Celebrity 3**\n\nThis experience actually convinced my team that we would not deal with celebrities anymore. Physical abuse of the maid was almost a daily affair. As soon as we got to know, we asked the maid to leave as soon as possible. When she came to our office, we could see physical marks on her body of physical abuse. We supported her and wanted to file a complaint in the local police station. But she asked us to let it go. She didn‚Äôt have the time to run to the police station every time the police calls her. Every time she would be summoned she would have to miss work and not get paid. We understand her concern. Without her support the police refused to take a complaint and we we couldnt file a case against the employer. \n\nThe best part is this ‚Äì We have a very strict abuse clause in our contract and the employer is not given a replacement if there is any form of abuse. The celebrity called us and told us that she has 4 lakh followers on twitter and she would post bad tweets about the company if we don‚Äôt give her a replacement. We enquired with the building security guard who says no one stick in this home for over a week since she beats them all.\n\n**Celebrity 4**\n\nShe has all the money in the world. Yet she couldn‚Äôt solve her maid issues. Her P.A. reached out to us and told us about the requirement. Initially we were very excited since this would open up avenues for future round of funding for the company too. She was also paying well. Atleast more than Mumbai market rate. However her attitude towards the staff was not less than someone who is uneducated. Verbal and physical abuse was a part of her daily routine. The maid got so fed up that she just absconded to her village and never came back. This left such a huge scar in her mind that later she told us she would never want to come back to any city. \n\nNow this left us to wonder. How do these people abuse their domestic helps as slaves. Again ‚Äì we were threatened with legal cases and obviously a small startup of mine cannot deal with legal notices from lawyers who charge Rs. 25 lakhs per hearing! We refunded and closed the case.\n\n**Celebrity 5**\n\nThis one is a classic. She took a maid from us. Everything was fine and the maid was happy. No abuse/harassment whatsoever. However she refused to pay us our service charges. \n\nBookMyBai charges about Rs. 15000 for a live-in maid. Initially when we were calling her for our payment, she stopped taking our calls. Later she flat-out refused to pay and said ‚Äì‚Äújo karna hai karlo!‚Äù ‚Äì If I am not wrong, she got multiple crores as alimony from her husband. She infact told us that if we call her again then she would file a case of harassment and extortion with the crime branch. CRIME BRANCH! Wow!\n\nThese are just a few cases which I have listed out. We have never come across cases like this with our not-a-bollywood-celebrity clients. Even if there is a deficiency of service, we mutually resolve the issue and come to an understanding. However these celebs have shaken our trust in all of them and we have now issued a blanket-ban. \n\nSource: [Article](https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/do-bollywood-celebs-abuse-their-maids-maid-agency-owners-reveal-horror-stories/story-KJVPcG3zfmOPP36sE08b6M.html) |  [Blog](https://www.bookmybai.com/Blogs/Why-did-BookMyBai-put-a-blanket-ban-on-providing-a-maid-to-Bollywood-celebrities/24)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'qvykq2'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qvykq2/do_bollywood_celebs_abuse_their_maids_maid_agency/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Anyone here who didn't liked the movie Jai Bhim?"<br />Body: 'It\'s such an extremely important and timely story, but to me it felt like Jai Bhim defeats the very purpose it set out to advocate. By establishing the tribals as a bunch of well meaning people who doesn\'t have any kind of agency, makers instead of building the story around their oppression stereotypes them as powerless meeks in desperate need of a savior. Who should have been the main players are reduced to just plot devices for the star to register his heroism.\n\nAnd then by introducing Suriya in a manner where he\'s already bigger than the cause he\'ll eventually fight for the film was already a lost cause. When Justice Chandru fought for tribal people he was fighting for a cause much bigger than his existence, when Suriya fought for Sengeni he was already bigger than everyone - the cause, the opponents, even the judges were smitten by him from scene one. For not a single moment it felt like a common man with conscience fighting against years of systemic and historical oppression and brutality. The entire film was just a moment away from unleashing Suriya and giving him license to beat the shit out of officers himself, bare handed. Watching Chandru should have been how ignorant and passively brutish we all have been and how important is to raise voice but instead we get a figure to not only cheer for but also to feel good about ourselves.\n\nThe potrayal of tribal people also felt pretty problematic to me, the film doesn\'t empathise with them it feels pity for them - there\'s a huge difference between them. There\'s also a difference between hard hitting scene and a mere exploitation, the way violence on tribals is shown in the film is exploitation at worst and trauma porn at best. Even in the scenes where the film feel bad for the victims, I felt a sense that film was looking down on them. \n\nEven as a court-drama, it\'s shot in such a old-fashioned way which makes the whole movie very unrelalstic. Contrast this film with Hansal Mehta\'s Shahid, honestly that\'s what I had in mind in terms of court-room scenes, at least. Esp. since this film was receiving such high acclaim.\n\nI know Shahid is a biography, but every character in that film from the oppressed to the oppressor is so nuanced &amp; potrayed so earnestly. Esp. the main character played by Rajkumar Rao, with his own set of flaws &amp; motivations stemming from his own struggles for justice. Something the character played by Suriya completely lacks of, making the character of Chandru pretty one-dimensional at best.\n\nI personally find Jai Bhim as a missed opportunity w.r.t. its problematic handling of such an important matter. \n\n"By showing me injustice he taught me to love justice. By teaching me what pain and humiliation were all about, he awakened my heart to mercy. Through these hardships I learned hard lessons. Fight against prejudice, battle the oppressors, support the underdog. Question authority, shake up the system, never be discouraged by hard times and hard people. Embrace those who are placed last, to whom even bottom looks like up."\n\n~ Roy Black'<br />Author: 'loneguzman'  id: 'qvy5cd'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qvy5cd/anyone_here_who_didnt_liked_the_movie_jai_bhim/</li>

      <li>Title::: "What's going to happen to Indian religions and cultures? Abrahamic are literally taking over my country. and I'm powerless to stop it. I'm scared for my life. We are slowly losing everything to them. Is it too late?"<br />Body: ' \n\nOk so hear me out. this particular issue is very close to my hear. Infact this issue is literally the only reason I support BJP.\n\n**I wouldn\'t have any problem with them if this issue was somehow solved. However, no party is doing anything about this, and I\'m just feeling more and more helpless and dejected with every passing day.  Idk what I can do as a teenager to change any of this.** \n\nSo here\'s the deal. Muslims grow A LOT faster than any other religion in our country. \n\nHindus made up 79.8% of India‚Äôs 1.2 billion (120 crore) total inhabitants in the most recent census, conducted in 2011. That is 0.7 percentage points less than in the previous census in 2001, and 4.3 points below the 84.1% recorded in 1951. Meanwhile, the share of Muslims grew from 13.4% in 2001 to 14.2% in 2011 ‚Äì up by a total of 4.4 percentage points since 1951, when the census found that Muslims comprised 9.8% of India‚Äôs population. \n\n[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/religious-composition-of-india/)\n\nWant to know the estimate for 2020?   According to Pew Research Center, there can be 213 million Muslims in 2020, India\'s 15.5% population.  That leaves Hindu to less than 79 percent.   \n\n**So basically, Hindus went from 85 percent of the population to just 79 percent, and Muslims went from under 10 percent of the population to more than 15.5 percent. And they are showing no signs of stopping.**  \n\nBuddhists, Sikhs and Jains all have fertility rates well below the national average and are therefore projected to shrink as a share of the population. \n\nc[https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/](https://www.pewforum.org/2021/09/21/population-growth-and-religious-composition/)\n\nLet me make it clear that Muslims were just around 25 percent of the whole subcontinent at the time of partition. We are headed for the same dark path again. \n\nI wanted to highlight the 2 most dangerous states.  Assam, and Kerala. \n\nHere are the stats for Assam. In 2901, Muslims were just 12 percent of the population.  **By 2001, they were 30.92%, in 2011 they became 34.22%, and FINALLY in 2021, they numbered at 40.03%** \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam\\_in\\_Assam#Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Assam#Population)\n\nTHIS IS FRIGHTENING. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF ASSAM ARE CLOSE TO BECOMING A MINORITY IN LITERALLY A FEW DECADES.  THE TRIBES THEIR ARE AFRAID OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE BEING DESTROYED. \n\nThat is why they are electing BJP.  But liberals cannot see their plight, because poor tribes or minorities that aren\'t Abrahamic don\'t matter to them. Unfortunately, it\'s too late for them.  All we can do now is learn from their demise, and make sure this doesn\'t happen again. \n\nThe second victim is - Kerala. The case of Kerala is even more tragic, because unlike Assam which was fucked over by Migration, Kerala was destroyed because of the low birth rate of it\'s Hindus, and their high conversion.   Hindus were 68.5 percent of the population in 1901, today, they were just 54 percent of the population in 2011. \n\nThat\'s not even the most tragic part. The thing is that Kerala Hindus will soon be outnumbered by Muslims, who were 24 percent of the population in 2011. You might ask, how tf will that happen? I\'ll show you a shocking stat. \n\n**In 2018, 43.80% of the total reported births in the state were to Muslims, 41.61% to Hindus, 14.31% to Christians and 0.25% to others, according to the vital statistics published by the Government of Kerala.**\n\n[http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital\\_Statistics/data/vital\\_statistics\\_2018.pdf](http://www.ecostat.kerala.gov.in/images/pdf/publications/Vital_Statistics/data/vital_statistics_2018.pdf)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\\_in\\_Kerala#Demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Kerala#Demographics)\n\nSo basically, **24 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 44 PERCENT OF BIRTHS, WHILE 54 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST 41 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BIRTHS?** \n\nWTFFFFFF\n\nThese states are the two biggest victims. West Bengal has 30 percent Muslims, but their 70 percent Hindu majority is so pathetic that I don\'t even feel like mentioning them.  They deserve everything that\'s coming to them. \n\n**There\'s also the fact that Hindus are overcounted A LOT**.   According to the National Family Health Survey, most Indian households (75%) belong to a caste category that is eligible for government reservations, but this varies widely by religious affiliation, ranging from 15% of Jains to 98% of Buddhists. About three-quarters (76%) of Christians belong to a historically disadvantaged caste, including 21% who say they are members of a Scheduled Caste. **However, on the Indian census, Christians are not able to identify as members of a Scheduled Caste, which may lead to an undercount of Christians in the census.** In the same survey, smaller shares of Muslims identified as belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Tribe, but over half said they were members of OBCs. \n\nSo a lot of Dalits are crypto Christians or Muslims, who mark themselves as Hindus just for the reservation. \n\nThis addresses  the main issue, which is demographic change thru high birth rate. There\'s also the second issue, which is conversion.  It is no secret that most of the Northeastern states went from having negligible Christians to A LOT of them becoming one in the last 50-70 years, primarily due to missionaries. \n\nThere\'s also the fact that Indians culture is always demonized. Our gods are made joke of by "minorities" but if we get angry it\'s an attack on "free speech". \n\nHowever, all atrocities committed by Muslim and Christian rulers is whitewashed.  Even well known tyrants like Aurangzeb are being called "innocent" nowadays. Our genocide and erasing of our culture is being denied. The growth of Muslim population is being seen as "paranoia\' and "not a big change". \n\nIndian culture is being attacked from all sides. The demographics are quietly being changed. Our tribals are getting converted. Our languages and religious texts are being erased. Our temples are being controlled by the govt.  Nothing is going our way. BJP isn\'t doing shit either. \n\nThey are also creating cracks in our society, by dividing us again. Hatred is being created between south and north Indians, between Sikhs and Hindus, between Dalits an UCs, between different castes, between Gujratis and Marathis.  Between Banias and other castes. Our unity is slowly getting destroyed. \n\nOur country is getting demonized on the world stage for it\'s treatment of Muslims, even though WE are the actual victims.  And out future looks very bleak. \n\n**What should be done? HOW DO WE SAVE OUR COUNTRY?

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Empire || Ch 1: Takshashila Khanda || 1.8: Mundia and modia'<br />Body: '*‚ÄúTo keep a value more sacred than the truth is to dishonour the Goddess Sarasvati; to cut off a man\'s tongue is to point a sword at her throat.‚Äù*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/10/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**‚Äî1.8. Mundia and modia‚Äî**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Which is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yield, or a big mine productive of commodities of inferior value? My teacher says that the former is better inasmuch as valuable products, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold and silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities.*\n\n*Not so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of purchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated articles of inferior value, collected from a vast and longstanding mine of inferior commodities.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 7.12:14-16\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‚ÄúI see ‚Äì it appears that matters have deteriorated greatly from the time of Emperor Mahapadma. I should have known better; you are young and inexperienced, Vishnugupta, but *I* should have made the effort to acquire more information before allowing you so freely to visit Pataliputra.‚Äù\n\nChanakya felt somewhat offended. ‚ÄúI cannot blame you for it, Professor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI must not consider myself entitled to rely on your wisdom for my protection much longer. If I wish to have an impact in politics, I must learn the art of cunning for myself.‚Äù\n\nProfessor Chanaka nodded with some amount of unspoken pride.\n\n‚ÄúI do have one thing to say, though,‚Äù Chanakya continued, ‚ÄúWith no disrespect intended. I believe that your negligence, and mine, can be attributed at least in part to your lack of appreciation for the wisdom of the classification of tribes as civilized and barbarian.‚Äù\n\nAt Professor Chanaka‚Äôs questioning gesture, he explained: ‚ÄúThere is a natural proclivity of man to assume that all others are like him,‚Äù explained Chanakya. ‚ÄúThus to correct this bias, men need to be warned otherwise. That is the cause for the system of castes, and that is the cause for the classification of tribes as barbarians. Because while we may have wicked practices of our own, those practices are those that do not shock us, unlike the unknown evils that we lack the proclivity to correctly anticipate among a barbarian people.‚Äù\n\nThe quality that Chanakya was rather fond of in Professor Chanaka was his ever-willingness to hear honest criticism, as well as his readiness to change his mind upon hearing correct counter-arguments, even if he had previously stated his opinion in the firmest terms and not made this readiness apparent. It was very beneficial to have a friend of this nature, as you could truly value their considered opinions.\n\n‚ÄúThere is wisdom to your words, Vishnugupta,‚Äù Professor Chanaka accepted at last. ‚ÄúA visit like yours could not possibly be imagined to have been dangerous in Gandhara, not even to one‚Äôs wildest imagination. So even while I made precautions, I didn‚Äôt consider that Magadha could change so substantially from one king to the next. If I had, I could have prepared you better. In not doing so, I have failed in my duty as a teacher.‚Äù\n\nThey stayed silent for a while.\n\n‚ÄúOn a more practical matter, Professor,‚Äù Chanakya said, ‚ÄúI have made two friends on my journey, Professor: Pabbata, the youngest prince of Magadha, and his informant Chandragupta of Kosala, the orphan of a financier by the daughter of a kayastha \\[1\\]. I would like to give them both an education of kshatriyas.‚Äù\n\nProfessor Chanaka nodded slowly, to which Chanakya continued: ‚ÄúWould it be possible for you to accept them as your students, and allow me to teach them independently?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, Vishnugupta,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúYour war has begun, and you must fight it yourself.‚Äù\n\nChanakya straightened his back.\n\n‚ÄúI believe it is time for you to be afforded your own gurukula,‚Äù said Professor Chanaka. ‚ÄúIt is not traditional to graduate a student in four years instead of the traditional sixteen, but I believe that on account of your famed intellect and your achievements thus far, it should be possible to do so without significant opposition from any relevant parties.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI would be honoured, Professor,‚Äù said Chanakya, ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt the ritual to graduate from studenthood *marriage*?‚Äù\n\nThe marriage of a child bride was forbidden in many ways and for many causes; and while Chanakya knew that *he* possessed sufficient intellect to completely ignore his ‚Äúbride‚Äù and regard such a marriage as purely symbolic, that same maturity could not be expected of the girl.\n\n‚ÄúIndeed. It would be neither possible nor legal for you to marry a girl of similar age to yourself, except perhaps with a Scythian or such barbarian girl, but there are moral objections to that as well. I believe there should not be much objection to a symbolic marriage of you to an animal or plant.‚Äù\n\nChanakya made a mental note that rituals were far less restrictive than they were often written to be, and to simply ask for what he wanted in future.\n\n‚ÄúI applaud your choice of allies to influence, Vishnugupta.‚Äù Chanaka‚Äôs eyes were distant. ‚ÄúI can only hope that you will choose with similar wisdom those who influence you.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúProfessor, do you believe that if I had planned better, and acted differently in Pataliputra?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, I do not think there is any means by which you can effectively influence the politics of Magadha from within. No, I do not think there are any means but war against Magadha.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps we ought to spend some time and think about alternative approaches in more detail,‚Äù Chanakya suggested. ‚ÄúAnd if we find one, we could send another scholar, trained to that approach, with an apology for my behaviour‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúVishnugupta,‚Äù Professor Chanaka interrupted, his smile a mix of sympathy and wryness, ‚ÄúWhat good is a life of apology?‚Äù\n\nChanakya grinned very widely at this.\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\nFinally, Chanakya came to the question that was truly pressing in his mind. While he was aware that Chanaka shared his ambitions to some degree ‚Äì from the conversation they‚Äôd had two years ago after the debacle with Vishtaspa ‚Äì but they had not discussed the matter further since, and Chanakya was surprised to hear him mention it today.\n\n‚ÄúProfessor,‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúWhat did you mean when you said my war has begun?‚Äù\n\nAt Professor Chanaka‚Äôs silence, he continued.\n\n‚ÄúMany a time, you have said that I and I alone have the capacity to lead a revolution, to defeat Magadha and Persia, to restore the ways of the ancients and to improve upon them. Nothing could be more desirable to me, but I must know the answer to this question: when such sentiment is so widespread, then why, over the past one hundred and eighty years, has no Professor at Taxila successfully carried out such a revolution, against either Magadha or Persia? Why have *you* never sought such goals for your own achievement?‚Äù\n\nProfessor Chanaka replied after some delay. ‚ÄúThere is honour in scholarly pursuit,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt is not necessary that every Brahmin here at Taxila must have political ambitions. Academic ambition is even more respectable.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, in the same way that the steel of the South is more respectable than the steel of Kosambi; nonetheless there is only so much steel that the South produces, and those who lack the wealth to purchase it must make do with the steel of Kosambi. Or how a wife of equal caste is more respectable than a wife of one caste lower; yet as men marry multiple women, a man must have wives of one caste lower. Or similarly of the horses of Asvaka against Eastern horses, or the elephants of Magadha against local ones. There is much profit to be made in such a revolution, and surely there must have been *someone* who rose to pick up this torch? What is it that causes you to believe that *I* am uniquely equipped to succeed in, in a manner that no one else has been?‚Äù\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n‚ÄúDo you know, Vishnugupta, why I so readily accepted you as my student all those years ago?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause of my obvious intelligence?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat too.‚Äù\n\nBefore Chanakya could guess again, Chanaka continued: ‚ÄúIn your brag, you mentioned the story of the Naga ascetic who proclaimed, based on your teeth, that you were destined for kingship. You said that even after your father broke your teeth, the ascetic had said that if not king, you will be the power behind the throne. Do you understand what I am saying?‚Äù\n\nChanakya‚Äôs face must have shown his disappointment at that explanation, for Professor Chanaka continued: ‚ÄúDo not be silly ‚Äì I do not care for what any ascetic has to say anything; in fact, I would much rather learn that you fabricated the entire story.‚Äù\n\nAfter some brief deliberation, Chanakya answered: ‚ÄúYou were impressed that I had chosen to include this story in my brag, not at the story itself. Forgive me, Professor, but I still do not see *why*.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed you don‚Äôt ‚Äì for what impressed me was that you *saw no dishonour in the ascetic‚Äôs words*. You neither considered the job of a king as something beneath your caste, nor were you then offended to be relegated to the power behind the throne.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou liked that what mattered to me was the actual consequences of my actions,‚Äù Chanakya completed, ‚ÄúNot social positions or titles, or the view that people might possess of me. That what matters to me is the actual accomplishment my goals, the realization of my ambitions, not my image or signalling of popular traits.‚Äù\n\nProfessor Chanaka nodded. ‚ÄúAs you know, Vishnugupta: there are only three personality types of man: *sattva* (goodness), *tamas* (wicked) and *rajas* (greatness or ambitiousness) ‚Äì and there is a certain invariance to these types. Even if you may have erred in these past weeks, if you were deficient in your use of cunning, I believe that that judgement I made of your person four years ago remains true, that the qualities I believe you to possess ‚Äì specifically, that of *rajas* ‚Äì are innate to you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù Chanakya assured.\n\n‚ÄúToo many aged men emphasize *sattva* alone, but *sattva* without *rajas* is like an archer without his bow. Such a man, even as he goes to great lengths to do good rather than bad, never accomplishes any significant amount of good, for he is lacking in ambition. Certainly, the quality of *sattva* is to be honoured, as we honour cows ‚Äì for the cow symbolizes *sattva*, as the vulture symbolizes *tamas*, yet neither of them is capable of ruling the world. No, it is man, and man alone, who possesses *rajas*, who is equipped to rule the world.\n\n‚ÄúToo many young men emphasize *rajas* alone: princes who spend their lives rallying armies to battle, never quite identifying what it is they are fighting for. Such men‚Äôs names are never immortalized in history, for in all their lives they accomplish nothing but the change of the colour of a flag on a fort, or some letters on a writ. For *rajas* alone, without *sattva* or *tamas*, is ambitiousness without ambition, it is passion without purpose. Such ones are mere tools to those men who possess true ambition.\n\n‚Äú*Sattva* without *rajas* causes a small amount of good; *tamas* without *rajas* causes a small amount of evil; *rajas* alone causes a great amount of nonsense; a combination of *sattva* and *rajas* accomplishes a great amount of good; and a combination of *sattva* and *tamas* accomplishes a great deal of evil. Thus it is a combination of *sattva* and *rajas* that is necessary.\n\n‚ÄúAjatashatru, in his day, was a brilliant inventor and an ambitious conqueror,‚Äù Professor Chanaka continued. ‚ÄúYet he was completely devoid of morality, and brought great ruin to the nations of the civilized world.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúA combination of *Tamas* and *Rajas*,‚Äù Chanakya noted. ‚ÄúAnd on the other hand, all the rulers of the Gangetic Mahajanapadas possessed *Sattva* but no *Rajas*, and thus they fell to Ajatashatru.‚Äù\n\nProfessor Chanaka smiled. ‚ÄúAll but one. The Consul of Mathura, the mighty Sage Samkarshana. He alone possessed both qualities of *sattva* and *rajas*, and he alone successfully resisted Ajatashatru‚Äôs invasion. And to forelong his legacy, he sought to find a worthy successor who possessed in him these very qualities: who possessed as much *rajas* as Ajatashatru did, and who possessed as much *sattva* as Ajatashatru possessed *tamas*. And these were the qualities that Samkarshana found in Vasudeva, whom he made his heir.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd these are the qualities you found in me,‚Äù Chanakya finished. ‚ÄúAs the Heirs of Samkarshana resisted Magadhan conquest for one hundred and fifty years, you believe that I, possessed of these qualities, can invite a golden age of prosperity and Vedic scholarship.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot quite, Vishnugupta,‚Äù said Professor Chanaka. ‚ÄúFor these are the qualities you already possess, and they are the qualities that you must seek in your own Vasudeva.‚Äù \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *kayastha* ‚Äì caste of scribes and mid to low level bureaucrats'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'qvmo1q'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qvmo1q/the_great_empire_ch_1_takshashila_khanda_18/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Is there a need for a book on Indian jurisprudence?'<br />Body: 'Was looking for decent books written in English about Indian case law and jurisprudence. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/History-Supreme-Court-Bernard-Schwartz/dp/0195093879), but for India. Couldn\'t find them.

      <li>Title::: 'Indian Aviation Ministry - A Fight for Indian airline industry forcing Indians to cough up exorbitant money to Foreign airlines.'<br />Body: 'Off late, many Foreign airlines are cancelling tickets for passengers traveling To &amp; From India. I will take Emirates as an example, and Emirates cancels tickets for Economy travelers seemingly random both ways From &amp; To India. When enquired with customer care, they mention the reasons as "regulations" from Indian Govt is limiting their capacity. They mention that Govt has capped the no. of economy passengers to 160 &amp; in flights in which they have sold tickets more than that, they cancel some tickets (may be people who bought at lower cost). The travelers are given option to re-book with Emirates for a different date or get refund. \n\nNow, the cancellations as late as even within a week of planned travel &amp; people are forced to buy tickets at exorbitant rates from other airlines. \n\nNow, I would recommend you to read the below link.\n\n[https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel-trends/indias-air-bubble-arrangements-may-not-be-driven-by-pandemic-iata-dg-7680581.html](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel-trends/indias-air-bubble-arrangements-may-not-be-driven-by-pandemic-iata-dg-7680581.html)\n\nA gist of above news article is, India is trying to equalize the load between foreign &amp; Indian airlines by forcing foreign airlines to reduce their capacity. \n\nAssume, you are someone not living in Delhi or Mumbai, say Hyderabad, and you are traveling to a City like Los Angeles. No Indian or Foreign airline operates direct flights from India to US cities other than New York, Chicago, San Francisco or DC in US. So, Indians hugely depend on Middle eastern or European airlines to travel to these destinations with "Just 1" transit. If Indians wish to use Air India or United, they have to take one flight from their city to Del/Mum, 2nd flight to US (to one of the handful of cities Air India/United operate) and then 3rd flight to their destination.\n\nIndian Govt capping the no. of seats to Middle eastern airlines is affecting these travelers from cities like Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad etc. who have no decent option other than these airlines to reach their destinations, which No Indian airlines provide service to. \n\nLet Govt make one or 2 Indian airlines, service more cities in US (which have huge Indian diaspora like - Houston, Dallas, LA, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami) &amp; other countries, before forcing foreign airlines to cancel the tickets of people traveling to these places. Indian airlines do not have even decent Foreign network, and ME &amp; European airlines are the only option available for many destinations.\n\nAirlines (both Air India &amp; Foreign) on their part exploit this situation, knowing very well, people have no option but to cough up the money they ask. With multiple RT PCR / Vaccination restrictions, travelers do not have many options to travel &amp; with Govt enabling airlines to just exploit, it is people who suffer.'<br />Author: 'RealityCheck18'  id: 'qvkes3'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qvkes3/indian_aviation_ministry_a_fight_for_indian/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Can we applaud BJP for finally rolling up their sleeves to clean the PSU mess?'<br />Body: 'So, in this other popular Indian sub which shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, people were sucking up to Jawaharlal Nehru left and right and defending his fabian socialism nonsense like there\'s no tomorrow. I am all in support of fabian socialism as long as the government implementing the same has the competency to create a public sector just as good. However, as we know, Congress is all talk and no work. They did build PSUs but these PSUs instead of working towards building export competitive products and world class designs were just a big waste of tax payer money.\n\nBSNL for example, used to make citizens wait for years together for getting a simple telephone line. Jio on the other hand rolled out 4G on a pan India basis within 6 years (the first 4G spectrum auctions were around 2010). Banks like SBI even today work as though they are the ones doing us a favor by being in existence. Private banks like HDFC and ICICI have been so competitive that a lot of multinational banking companies like Deutsche, Citi and Standard Chartered have all but left India. So many folks drew heft salaries from DRDO and many still do draw hefty pensions. However, did you know that India is the second largest importer of arms in the world? Forget about building export competitive products, these defence PSUs are not considered by even our own military and we don\'t even have the most advanced military on earth. Companies like Coal India are so inefficient at mining coal and state owned power distribution cos are so inefficient at distributing power, that even today, 24x7 electricity is a pipe dream for many folks from Tier 3 states.\n\nThis is not a recent phenomena. Incompetence of PSUs has been something that has been evident ever since the economy opened up in 1990s and private sector started becoming more active. The Vajypayee era was massive in terms of finally cutting the fat that the PSUs are on this country but two decades of subsequent Congress rule, revived these dying zombies again. \n\nIt is now that these PSUs are being trimmed again. The sale of Air India was a huge deal. No one has written much about it but it gets the ball rolling for similar such monetization of other PSUs. Bank privatization is next on this government\'s agenda. I honestly am super relieved that at least some government is finally taking up the matter of trimming PSUs and realizing the gains into more productive purposes. It is not even about the gains, as much as it is about utilizing natural resources more efficiently. A lot of these PSUs sit on national natural resources that are scarce and limited in nature and have a high value. \n\nAs a citizen, it is our right to ensure that the nation\'s resources are allocated to whoever can best make the most productive use of it. If its private companies that are more productive then it should be given to these private companies. Surely the government needs to first sort out basic civic amenities like water, sewage, education etc before trying their hand at building "world class companies". I am just glad that this is finally happening and its finally being realized. I cannot stand to see another PSU guy retiring on my tax money without any meaningful contribution.'<br />Author: 'lic_n_reg_pls'  id: 'qviqvt'<br />Score:189<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qviqvt/can_we_applaud_bjp_for_finally_rolling_up_their/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Unpopular opinion: India must be much more wary of America than the CCP'<br />Body: 'Let me start off by saying that the embrace with the US was probably inevitable given rising troubles with China. But I\'m seeing too many Indians think the US actually cares about strengthening our defence to contain our eastern neighbour because of \'shared geopolitical interests\', and this is true. And this is precisely why we need to be incredibly cautious about this affair.\n\nAlways remember, the sheer level of hatred directed towards India by MSM is probably unmatched elsewhere. For all the caterwauling about China, woke neoliberals seem to think INDIAN nationalism is somehow the worst thing in existence right now. This past year, I\'ve been lurking around the big news subs and PublicFreakout, the level of contempt and racial profiling of 1B+ people in a single brushstroke was sickening. And all these people are turbo SJWs who\'ve literally dedicated their lives to spot "racism" at every nook and corner, India gets a special exception for its \'fascism\'. Fruit of neoliberal media, not Global Times. Indian immigrants have done them no wrong, and yet they act like they *want* a nutter to freak out and do something really bad and violent just so they could get ammo to demonise Indians. Just like that "diversity manager" at Silicon Valley calling us "parasites" for our supposed ideology. There\'s an uptick in Republican support among Indian Americans now, and they\'re pinning this on our "Muslim hatred". Maybe because Indians are the richest immigrant ethnic group in the US, where double income households take up a substantial share of the population and they have less children, ergo cutting down their dependency on welfare schemes of the state that they\'re shifting their vote? Nope, just "Muslim hatred", nothing more.\n\nAnd this is deeply influencing the thinking of young Indians, especially NRIs. Keep in mind that they\'re not doing this or targeting educational institutions to win the 2024 or even the 2029 general elections, they know they can\'t. They\'re playing the long game, to foster a young generation of liberals living in big cities. Pretty much what played out in the west, wokeism is simply the latest development in a long process and perhaps social media accelerated it. This level of digital influence is wielded by the US, not China. China has zero cultural influence over us and they do not care. But the US wants India to be its very own bulwark against China, and I think most people can see that.\n\nAnd that\'s probably why India seems to get *more* negative coverage than China. The American neoliberal elites know where China stands, or where Russia stands, or Iran, or Nork. There probably was genuine expectation that Modi will fully sell out but our "ambivalent" foreign policy is unpredictable in their POV. They took the first cut when we scrapped A370. The recent acquisition of S400s and pragmatism towards both Russia and Iran likely rubbed salt into those wounds. Perhaps its their way of saying "fall in line or else".\n\nIn short, we probably do need US support for the foreseeable future. But this is also like walking on a tightrope. The US is as much a colonial scum as the CCP. India *has* to remain sovereign, simply because we\'re not seeing them grab tracts of land shouldn\'t blind us to the gradual digital, diplomatic and economic colonisation by the Americans.

      <li>Title::: 'Disappointing that Modiji continues Congress tradition of whitewashing history. On occasion of commemorating Janjatiya Divas in honor of Birsa Munda, he failed to mention that Mundaji fought hard against Christian missionaries as they were erasing dharma of tribals by conversions.'<br />Body: "In the late 19th century, as the flame of activism was extinguished in the Bengal presidency, a tribal leader marked protest against the British rule which goes to be remembered in the history books forever.\n\nA tribal leader belonging to the Munda tribe became an example to many and enhanced the spirits of nationalism in every Indian freedom fighter. Birsa Munda was born at Ulihatu village, in Lohardaga district of Bengal presidency (presently in Jharkhand) on November 15, 1875. The day will be commemorated as 'Janjatiya Gaurav Divas' along with Jharkhand foundation day.\n\nBelonging from the Munda tribe, his life revolved around travelling from one village to the other with his parents. He was educated by his teacher Jaipal Nag who recommended him to convert to Christianity so that he could join the German Mission school. Birsa Munda understood very soon that Christian missionaries were converting tribals to Christianity. Birsa soon started to challenge the Christian missionaries and revolted against the conversion activities along with the Munda and Oraon communities. He started a new faith known as ‚ÄòBirsait‚Äô. The tribal leader urged other tribal communities to join the sect. He urged the Mundas to clean villages, stop consuming liquor and stop believing in superstitions, witchcraft.\n\nBirsa Munda spent about four years in Chaibasa starting from 1886 to 1890. Chaibasa was close to the epicenter of Sardars agitation. The Sardars protested against the anti-government, anti-missionary programs. The protests staged by the Sardars, impacted Birsa Munda a lot.\n\nFollowing the movement and widespread agitation, Birsa Munda became a part of the movement against the British Raj.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the land policies of Britishers destroyed the traditional tribal land system and moneylenders started taking over their lands. Missionaries were against the tribal culture. Birsa Munda led a huge tribal movement in the South of Ranchi in 1899. The tribal movement aimed at driving the British government out of the region. The movement was known as ‚ÄòUlgulan‚Äô.\n\nBirsa Munda orated fiery speeches in traditional language to rouse people for establishing ‚ÄòMunda Raj‚Äô. Birsa and his followers started to attack police stations, raided properties of ‚Äòzamindars‚Äô, raised white flags instead of British flags to denote the rise of ‚ÄòMunda Raj‚Äô.\n\nhttps://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/in-focus/article/remembering-birsa-munda-the-man-who-led-the-largest-revolt-of-tribals/831898\n\nAs a child, Birsa Munda was baptized and raised as ‚ÄúBirsa David‚Äù at a school in Jharkhand run by Christian missionaries. Many tribals at the time had to convert thus, as a precondition for receiving an education in missionary schools. This was in the 1870s and the 1880s, when oppression by Christian missionaries, obviously patronized by the British colonial government was at its peak.\n\nOn growing up, he cast away the name of ‚ÄúBirsa David‚Äù and decided to return to his original faith. The Church at the time extracted tributes from the public, leading to immense hardship among the much oppressed and impoverished people. He decided to start an uprising.\n\nRead: Birsa Munda, a tribal legend who was a nightmare for Christian missionaries during the British Raj\n\nMatters came to a head-on Christmas eve in December 1899, when Birsa Munda and his followers rose up against the Church and landowners patronized by the imperial government. This is recorded in his official biography by A K Dhan from the Publications Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2019/11/birsa-munda-144-birth-anniversary-missionary-anti-conversion-law/\n\nhttps://www.opindia.com/2019/06/birsa-munda-a-tribal-legend-who-was-a-nightmare-for-christian-missionaries-during-the-british-raj/"<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'qufvjv'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qufvjv/disappointing_that_modiji_continues_congress/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'News reports of Maoists setting up new guerilla base in Madhya Pradesh from last few months'<br />Body: 'Have Maoists expanded their footprint in Madhya Pradesh? It seems so going by the latest classification of left-wing extremism (LWE) affected districts in the country, put out by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).\n\nTill 2018, Madhya Pradesh only had one district, Balaghat, classified as an LWE-affected district. In 2018, an adjoining tribal and forested district, Mandla, was included in the list. In the latest classification, the MHA has added Dindori, another adjoining district to the Maoist-affected list in MP.\n\nMore districts as LWE affected means areas hitherto with no Maoist presence have started recording their movements. Mandla had its first encounter ever with Maoists in December 2020. Dindori is considered an entry point for members of the ‚ÄòVistaar battalion/ dalam‚Äô.\n\nWhy has Dindori been included as an SRE eligible district? Sources in the security establishment point out that there has been a spillover effect of Maoist cadre coming from neighbouring Chhattisgarh to Dindori. Dindori is located to the north-east of Mandla and borders Chhattisgarh too. Once Maoist activity picked up in Mandla, it was only logical that it would engulf Dindori. The state government sent a report on Naxal activity there which was corroborated by intelligence agencies leading to the inclusion of Dindori.\n\nThe Vistaar battalion of the Maoists has been active in the tri-junction area of MP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra for the past few years now. The Vistaar battalion/ dalam (literally meaning extension) came up after the Maoists started losing control of territory in south Chhattisgarh (CG) and decided to explore new areas for operations. They felt that opening up a new front would put pressure on forces that were gaining in south CG. Towards this end, a Maoist force was raised to operate in the tri-junction of MP, CG and Maharashtra.\n\nBalaghat, Mandla and Dindori are the districts affected on the MP side, with Kawardha and Rajnandgaon on the Chhattisgarh side and Gadhchiroli on the Maharashtra side. This is the area of operations of the Vistaar dalam.\n\nIn February this year, two women Maoists were killed in a gun battle with security forces in Mandla district. This was the first time an encounter between security forces and Maoists was reported from Mandla. In December 2020, two other women Maoists were killed in Kirnapur area of Balaghat district. Balaghat has witnessed half a dozen ‚Äòengagements‚Äô between the forces and Maoists in the last 10 months.\n\nBut even as districts are declared LWE affected, they may not be affected in their entirety by the presence of Maoists, but it does give an idea of their expanding footprint. Balaghat district, originally the only LWE affected district in MP, is 9,245 sq. km in area. With the addition of Mandla and Dindori, a 15,000 sq. km area has been added in the last three years\n\nhttps://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/are-maoists-expanding-their-footprint-in-madhya-pradesh-1820832-2021-06-29\n\n#Maoists declare Kanha and Bhoramdeo sanctuary new ‚Äòdivision‚Äô\n\nThe MMC zone was created by Maoists in 2016-17. It includes districts situated at the tri-junction of three states and has seen the presence of Vistaar Dalam, which has around 200 armed cadre in its ranks.\n\nA document recovered from an encounter spot on the border of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh suggest that Maoists have declared a new division comprising Kanha national park and Bhoramdeo wildlife sanctuary and named it as ‚ÄòKB‚Äô.\n\nKanha national park comes under Mandala and Balaghat districts of Madhya Pradesh while Bhoramdeo comes under Kawardha district of Chhattisgarh. Police believe that because of the dense forest and tough terrain the Maoists have declared this area as a division.\n\n‚ÄòKB‚Äô is now the second division under newly formed MMC zone (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh), the first being GRB (Gondia, Rajanandgaon Balaghat).\n\nThe MMC zone was created by Maoists in 2016-17. It includes districts situated at the tri-junction of three states and has seen the presence of Vistaar Dalam, which has around 200 armed cadre in its ranks. The MMC is presently headed by a central committee member of CPI (Maoist) Deepak Teltumbde.\n\nThe document was among Maoist literature found at a spot where 46-year-old Maoist Jamuna alias Sagan Bai was killed in an encounter in February 28 this year. Jamuna was allegedly involved in 1999 in the killing of Likhiram Kavre, a minister in the then Madhya Pradesh government. Jamuna carried an award of Rs 20 lakh on her head.\n\nMaoist leaders have been directed to focus on the ‚ÄòKB‚Äô division and two area committees have been created under the new division, document said. It also showed that ‚Äúdisplacement‚Äù and ‚Äúbamboo rates‚Äù are the key issues of the division and Maoists have already started recruiting locals.\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-declare-kanha-and-bhoramdeo-sanctuary-new-division/story-aB9qqeYXZ41U81kWRfdTIP.html\n\nIn what could signal an attempt to shift their base from Chhattisgarh, two suspected Maoists, including a woman, were gunned down by police in Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs Mandla district on the night of 12 February, where they had allegedly gone to recruit new members.\n\nWhile the woman has been identified woman as Savita, three firearms, including a SLR, have been recovered from the duo so far.\n\nAccording to police, they were associated to the Darekasa Dalam and the Malajkhand Dalam. Moreover, police say that both worked as area committee members and were carrying a combined bounty of Rs 28lakh on their heads in three states ‚Äì Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh.\nPolice say the two suspected Maoists were in the district ‚Äì that shares its border with Chhattisgarh ‚Äì to recruit new members. Nine other Maoists had reportedly accompanied them in a bid to regain control over a lost territory.\n\n\nFour Months, Five Maoist Encounters\nInterestingly, in the last four months alone, the Balaghat police have killed five suspected Maoists in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe encounter of two suspected Maoists in MP‚Äôs Mandla comes after the Balaghat police had in December last year, encountered two female Maoists ‚Äì Savitri alias Aayte (24) and Shobha (30) ‚Äì in an overnight operation. The two were killed in the Borevan forest region, which about 55 km away from the district headquarters.\nPrior to this, another female Maoist of Chhattisgarh‚Äôs Bastar district ‚Äì Sharda, associated with Katia-Mocha-Vistaar-Dalam ‚Äì was gunned in Balaghat district on 4 November. She was carrying a cash reward of Rs 3 lakh on her head.\nIn addition to it, heavy crossfire had erupted between police and Maoists in Mandla district on the night of 28 January this year.\n\nThe fire-exchange took place in an area near the MP-Chhattisgarh border, which is reportedly used by the Maoists to cross over from one state to another. During that incident, the Maoists fled after 100 rounds of bullets were fired by both sides.\n\nKanha-Bhoramdeo: The New Maoist Woods?\nSpeaking to The Quint, Balaghat Superintendent of Police Abhishek Tiwari, said new Maoist recruits are being sent to Balaghat and Mandla districts from southern regions, and that the numbers of the ultras in Balaghat have surged.\n\nMoreover, police sources said, around 350 Maoists have been deployed in Balaghat to recruit new cadres and reclaim their lost region.\n\nBoth Kanha and Bhoramdeo are interconnected through a thick patch of forests, located on the borders of Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh.\n\nAccording to an intelligence officer, since the Kanha-Bhoramdeo area is more difficult to navigate than the terrains of south Bastar, Maoists are using this to their advantage and rebuilding their military wing by recruiting new cadres.\n\nThe impenetrable forests patch of Kanha-Bhoramdeo-Amarkantak is inaccessible, offers a safe hideout for Maoists, and, is very scarcely policed.\n\nMaoist Activity in Kanha-Bhoramdeo ‚ÄòAlarming‚Äô\nIn January 2021, PTI reported that over 100 Maoists had crossed over to Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs tribal-dominated areas of Mandla and Balaghat districts in the last few months.\n\nCommenting on it, Balaghat SP Tiwari, said, ‚ÄúEarlier, they used the buffer zones of Kanha-Bhoramdeo as a passage to and from Chhattisgarh to MP, but now they have entered into the core parts of Kanha.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.thequint.com/news/india/maoist-shifting-from-chhattisgarh-to-madhya-pradesh#read-more'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'quecqc'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/quecqc/news_reports_of_maoists_setting_up_new_guerilla/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Did Nehru have Sex with the Last British Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten's Wife?"<br />Body: 'On this children\'s day/Nehru\'s birthday, let\'s put aside his flaws and own children and let\'s talk about quite possibly the single most important thing he did in his life, something that is uncontested as being the most awe-inspiring moment of the Indian independence struggle.\n\nHe cucked Lord Mountbatten.\n\nMany of you might have heard the basic version of this story, it\'s popular in India, it goes something like "lmao remember when Nehru slept with Mountbatten\'s wife?".\n\nI did some research and here are more details. Mountbatten was the viceroy of India and was working closely with Nehru during the transition of government, from British colony to sovereign state. Nehru became close to Edwina (Lady Mountbatten) and his daughter, Pamela.\n\n&gt;Pamela was 17-years-old then and says that she saw the first stages of what would go on to become a relationship based on "equality of spirit and intellect". "She found in Panditji the companionship and equality of spirit and intellect that she craved," Pamela said  \nReading Nehru\'s inner thoughts and feelings for her mother in his letters made Pamela "realise how deeply he and my mother loved and respected each other".\n\nPamela also however says that they never had a sexual relationship.\n\n&gt;"Quite apart from the fact that neither my mother nor Panditji had time to indulge in a physical affair, they were rarely alone. They were always surrounded by staff, police and other people," Pamela writes.\n\nNow that is a pretty lame excuse. Especially after she goes onto describe their relationship in such a way. Nehru\'s image of being a flirtatious womanizer doesn\'t help the case either. Additionally, there is evidence of Edwina\'s other affairs, including one with a black man, making it clear that she did not care about the societal norms or the heavily different views on race in that period.\n\nIt should also be noted however, that the side claiming they slept together has no hard evidence either. Nehru and Edwina wrote to each other till her death, yet unlike the rest of Lord and Lady Mountbatten\'s diaries and correspondence, this particular set of letters has not been released to the public in whole. While this does not prove anything, it definitely creates suspicions as to what was the contents of these letters.\n\n[Images like these](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ_ndMOgU-BcCHy9OfeECUVZKk5OrSZYrWqANhgFLcYKCD4v2UWqKAE1sI&amp;s=10) can easily sum up the "Oh yeah they definitely fucked" argument.\n\nHere are some other interesting moments in their relationship:\n\n&gt;As the Mountbattens prepared to leave India, Edwina wanted to gift Nehru an emerald ring, her daughters writes in the book. However, Edwina knew that Nehru would not accept is and so instead she handed the jewel over to Indira Gandhi, Nehru\'s daughter, telling her to pawn it off in case of financial difficulties.  \nWhen Edwina died suddenly, aged 59, she was found in bed, The Mountbattens: Their Lives And Loves author Andrew Lownie states, with some of Nehru‚Äôs letters.  \nPamela also further writes in her book that on her death in 1960, Edwina was buried at sea as per her wish. "As her bereaved family steamed away from the scene after casting wreaths at the spot, the Indian frigate INS Trishul quietly took our place and, on Panditji‚Äôs instructions, marigolds were scattered upon the waves‚Äù.\n\nPopular culture has made its judgement and it is a resounding "they fucked", this can be seen in Netflix original "the crown" where charcters make statements like this:\n\n&gt;Oh, it is Lord Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh‚Äôs uncle. The man who gave away India, and his own wife. Cuckolded by Nehru, if you please. [Watch here](https://twitter.com/saumyakumary/status/1197811338543804418?t=KCDou5bPieYbhNthXRJppg&amp;s=19)\n\nOr [this scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUrzVQ4nOm0&amp;feature=emb_title) where he accepts his wife sleeping with Nehru.\n\nWether they fucked or not is something, we have no definitive answer to. I however, an an Indian, like to believe that while the British were finally leaving, Nehru fucked the viceroy\'s wife.\n\nRefrences: [https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/memories-of-a-doting-daughter/article4497874.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/memories-of-a-doting-daughter/article4497874.ece) [https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/nehru-edwina-mountbatten-did-not-have-time-for-physical-affair-says-daughter-1027111-2017-07-30](https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/nehru-edwina-mountbatten-did-not-have-time-for-physical-affair-says-daughter-1027111-2017-07-30)'<br />Author: 'sadhgurukilledmywife'  id: 'qtrees'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qtrees/did_nehru_have_sex_with_the_last_british_viceroy/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Introducing Trylyo, a discussion platform with support for nine Indian languages, with full translation support for all content!'<br />Body: "Hello!\n\nIntroducing  Trylyo, a discussion platform with support for nine Indian languages  (more coming soon!). This is a non-profit initiative to help connect  Indians across language barriers with the help of technology. All posts,  profiles, text from images and the UI can be translated.\n\n[https://trylyo.com](https://trylyo.com/)\n\nThis  does share some features with a previous website with the same name,  but the entire code has been re-written and had many new features added.\n\n**Supported languages:**\n\n* English\n* Hindi\n* Bengali\n* Punjabi\n* Marathi\n* Tamil\n* Telugu\n* Kannada\n\n**Currently working on:**\n\n* Gujarati\n* Malayalam\n\nWe would appreciate any help with implementing Gujarati or Malayalam.\n\nWhat do we translate?\n\nEverything.  All posts that you read, profiles you visit, all the text inside of  Image, we even automatically translate all the replies you give to the  language of the post you're replying to.\n\nWhy?\n\nOur  goal is to provide a free, democratic and privacy-friendly platform to  help Indians connect across language barriers with the help of  technology.\n\nWhat is our privacy policy?\n\nWe  do not sell any user data to any 3rd parties, or use it to provide any  targeted advertisement. We also do not store user data after deletion.\n\nHow will we generate revenue?\n\nWe don't. We are a non-profit initiative. To cover running costs, we rely on donations and future plans include *non-targeted ads.* For now, server costs are negligible.\n\nWhat are some things we're working on?\n\n* **Improving the ranking system:** The ranking system is somewhat weird, and we're working on a way to fix it to be more accurate.\n* **Improving the UI:**  The UI is objectively ugly, so we're working on improving it. Things  such as icons, colors, animations need to improve. Dark mode is also,  admittedly, an eyesore.\n* **Mobile log-in:**  Currently, you can only log in using a traditional username + password.  We're currently working on implementing a SMS based log-in.\n* **A desktop site:**  The website is designed with mobile in mind. While it does work on  desktop, it does not look good or utilize the space efficiently.\n* **The fronted:** The front end isn't as good as we'd like it to be. So we're quickly working on improving it.\n* **Custom translation:**  To reduce our reliance on Google, we're currently working on  implementing in-house translation. Currently, we have English to Hindi  somewhat working, but it's nowhere as accurate as translations provided  by other 3rd party services.\n* **Better image transcription:**  We're currently using EasyOCR. While it works amazingly with images,  even images with backgrounds, it doesn't work that well with large and  complex text bodies like a newspaper. Plans are to eventually switch to  either a third party service such as Google's cloud vision or a Keras  based package.\n* **Better group management:**  Currently, group admins can only remove or accept members, or delete  posts. We're experimenting with automated filtering and more granular  control for admins.\n* **Video transcription**: We're currently trying implement video audio transcription. While feasible, it is expensive and difficult to scale.\n\nIs there an app?\n\nCurrently,  no. And we're not planning on building one either. Web technologies are  rapidly improving, and using a pure JavaScript HTML solution website  allows us to quickly push updates across devices and platforms. With  optimization, web solutions can feel just like a native app. And, you  can also 'install' it to your home screen!\n\nTechnical jargain for nerds:\n\n* **Frontend:** SPA designed using vanilla Javascript (shudders)\n* **Backend:** Python (Django + Django Rest Framework + Gunicorn + some more packages)\n* **Reverse proxy:** nGinx\n* **Database:** PostGreSQL\n* **Caching:** Redis\n* **Hosting:**  The main server + redis are hosted on AWS lightsail instances. Heavier  tasks are handled asynchronously by a private server due to cost  imitations of VPSs with high processing power.\n* **Translation:** Google translation + middle server to quickly cache result for good performance.\n* **Image transcription:** EasyOCR + TesseractOCR with some models pulled from GitHub and some custom trained models.\n\nHow can we help?\n\nShare the word. Talk about it with your friends and family! Post anything interesting you find.\n\nWhat do the name and icon mean?\n\nNothing.  The name was from an random generator and sounded somewhat good. The  logo is an elephant (designed in Microsoft paint) because they're cool  and and present in Indian culture.\n\nWho are we?\n\nI'm Ashutosh, a class 12 student and developer. I'm from Mumbai. Currently, I'm the only developer."<br />Author: 'CultOfTheDemonicDoge'  id: 'qsu8oz'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qsu8oz/introducing_trylyo_a_discussion_platform_with/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India‚Äôs climate future is a policy choice'<br />Body: " *This was originally posted at* [*https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/indias-climate-future-is-a-policy*](https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/indias-climate-future-is-a-policy)\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India [would achieve](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/india-targets-2070-for-net-zero-emissions-china-makes-no-new-commitments.html) carbon net-zero emissions by 2070. This is easier said than done, and for some good reasons.\xa0\n\n\xa0First, India has many years of economic growth ahead of itself. Before the pandemic India had a GDP/capita (PPP adjusted) of \\~$7k far lower than China at $16k, Japan at $42k and the US at $65k. Given that the last few decades of economic growth have led to large increases in carbon emissions (India [emitted ](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/india?country=~IND)2.63 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2019 versus 1.6 billion in 2009), it is likely that future years of growth too will also lead to a similar increase in emissions.\xa0\n\nSecond, despite the deceivingly low carbon emissions per capita number, India‚Äôs power sector has among the highest emissions intensity (source [here](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/1de6d91e-e23f-4e02-b1fb-51fdd6283b22/India_Energy_Outlook_2021.pdf): page 54)\xa0 among large economies. Should manufacturing be the driver of Indian growth, (as the government [wants it to be](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/modi-bats-for-make-in-india-relying-on-local-covid-vaccine-s-acceptance-11634883299556.html)), it would mean that energy demand grows faster than before. Which also means that Indian emissions increase faster than before, and faster than what one would expect from the service and agriculture based economy of the previous decades.\xa0\n\nThird, energy generation isn‚Äôt everything! While ensuring that energy is generated from low carbon sources is one large step to reducing carbon emissions, the government still has to deal with a power distribution that is not financially equipped to distribute renewable power (or with sufficient losses, any power!), increased urbanisation and higher demand for consumer durables that emit a large amount of greenhouse gases like ACs and refrigerators.\xa0\n\nIt might be tempting to not care. After all, haven‚Äôt rich countries emitted the majority of the carbon dioxide in the air now? Isn‚Äôt it their responsibility to worry about this, and shouldn‚Äôt developing countries like India focus on becoming rich first and worry about rich country concerns like carbon emissions later? Not exactly.\xa0\n\nFirst it is unfair to put the entire blame on developed countries. Developed countries have made substantial progress on reducing their carbon emissions. The 3 largest developed countries (US, Japan, Germany) have had [declining emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) for many years now. The US hit its emissions peak in 2007, Japan in 2012, and Germany in 1990. They have [higher shares ](https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/smart-energy/top-ten-countries-with-the-highest-proportion-of-renewable-energy/)of renewable energy than most large developing countries like India and China and have a lower carbon intensity of GDP.\xa0\n\nSecond, avoiding the extreme cases of climate change is worth a lot for every single country, regardless of its development level. If for example, global CO2 concentrations exceed 600 parts per million, there is a non-negligible chance that global temperatures might increase by 5‚ÑÉ. Martin Weitzman [estimated](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/fattaileduncertaintyeconomics.pdf) it at 29%, and for higher CO2 concentrations, it would be even higher. India will be severely affected by such extreme outcomes. For example, even with current policies, the Climate Impact Explorer [expects](http://climate-impact-explorer.climateanalytics.org/impacts/?region=IND&amp;indicator=ec2&amp;scenario=h_cpol&amp;warmingLevel=1.5&amp;temporalAveraging=annual&amp;spatialWeighting=other&amp;compareYear=2030) that the high end of river damages in 2050 is nearly 3x today, as it is for river flood depth. The worst case scenarios for climate change imply that crop yields [drop ](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/03/cline.htm)30-40% in India. Indian agricultural yields are already [very low](https://www.news18.com/news/india/poor-farmers-small-landholdings-low-crop-yield-crisis-why-india-desperately-needs-farm-reforms-3180602.html), and this would hurt millions of small farmers who are already facing financial stress. The key point is that as temperatures increase, the uncertainty in what happens increases. We might be able to mitigate the effects at lower levels, but should it go to higher temperatures, the negative effects do not have a clear limit. It should be a clear priority for all countries to avoid large increases in CO2 emissions that lead to the worst effects of climate change.\xa0\n\nFinally, should the Indian economy grow and India become a larger geopolitical player than it is today, other countries will ask India to pay its share in cutting carbon emissions. Work for that has to start as soon as possible.\xa0\xa0\n\nThere are a few major challenges that the Indian government will have to deal with in the coming decades.\n\nCoal‚Äôs Black Spot\n\nPeople think they know how much of a problem coal is. I assure you, that almost nobody‚Äôs intuition matches how bad coal is for the people. One terawatt hour of coal **leads to 1.5x the deaths of oil, 5 times the deaths from biomass, 8 times the deaths from natural gas,\xa0 350 times the deaths from nuclear, 650 times\xa0 the deaths from wind and 1200 times the deaths from solar and hydropower!** (Source [here](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy)).\xa0\n\nCoal makes up 44% of India‚Äôs energy supply but 70% of energy emissions. The International Institute for Sustainable Development [estimates](https://www.iisd.org/system/files/publications/india-energy-transition-2020.pdf) that in 2018 the social cost of coal in India was around 4 trillion rupees (about 54 billion USD).\xa0 It is not surprising that researchers have [calculated](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/5/e2017936118) that it causes roughly 112,000 deaths a year and building current plants would cause 844,000 deaths.\xa0\n\nCoal‚Äôs influence is going down in India albeit from a very high level. Solar is finally cheaper than coal, and there are several [stranded coal assets](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307135952/https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/12407.pdf) in India. Along with that, the Indian government has [committed](https://web.archive.org/web/20210923025955/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-01/india-sees-boosting-green-power-by-2030-overtaking-climate-goal) to reducing coal to 50% of electricity from 70% today.\xa0\n\nBut then, why does coal continue to dominate in India? The first answer is that it is cheap, abundant (with caveats) and reliable. Nearly 56% of Indian energy capacity (44% of supply and 70% of electricity) is from coal. Among the 3 largest energy sources, coal is the only one which has abundant domestic supplies. 75% of oil is imported compared to 50% of natural gas and only around a third of coal. Along with its low cost, there are several political economy reasons why coal isn‚Äôt going to go away quickly in India.\xa0\n\nFirst, the Indian government earns a large amount of money from mining coal. It is a majority owner in Coal India, the country‚Äôs largest coal miner with 85% of the coal supply. Nearly 25% of the Indian government's dividend revenue from state owned enterprises [comes](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-eyes-dividend-windfall-from-psus-11623869345536.html) from Coal India. Reducing coal mining would have a noticeable impact on the Indian government‚Äôs finances. Along with that nearly 5% of India‚Äôs tax revenues come from coal mining, and there are a large number of levies and [taxes on coal](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/consumers-pay-rs-25000-crore-price-for-high-coal-tax-keeping-power-out-of-gst/articleshow/80590164.cms) amounting to over 85% of the base price of coal.\xa0\n\nWhile coal is not a large percentage of India‚Äôs economy, coal mining is a large percentage of specific states in India. For the Indian states of Jharkhand and Chattisgarh, coal mining [forms ](https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Coal-Transition-in-India.pdf)10% and 9% respectively of their states‚Äô economy. Any actions to remove coal would not only be politically costly in these states but also would be met with opposition from them, because of job losses and tax revenue losses. Indian states are dependent on the central government for general revenue whose negotiations are a [contentious process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Finance_Commission) every 5 years. So, revenue independent of New Delhi is valued by them. (Watch the CM of Punjab [here](https://youtu.be/394CNPejCF4) at 0:55 talk about it for a brief second followed by Chhattisgarh CM later in Hindi)\n\nThe paradox regarding taxation of coal is that governments have two incentives: maximizing revenue and minimizing the social cost of pollution. The social cost of carbon in India is [estimated to be](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0282-y) around $86 per tonne of CO2. No government would tax carbon emissions of $86, but the real point is that there is a **tension between maximizing tax revenue and correcting the cost of pollution**. The socially optimal tax on carbon to compensate for the human cost of pollution is far higher than the tax optimal to maximize revenue. When given a choice, policymakers will pick the latter. They just can‚Äôt afford to lose the revenue from it.\xa0\n\nAnother way coal feeds into the Indian economy is via [cross subsidizing](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/) passenger railway fares. Coal is the largest component of the Indian Railways revenue, forming 44% of its revenue. India has the lowest passenger fare to freight fare value of any country in the world of 0.24. This is because the Railways overcharges coal by around 30%, and uses this to compensate for the loss it makes on passenger rail. This also raises Indian electricity costs by around Rs. 0.21/kWh.\xa0\n\nIt is clear that coal has to go faster than ever. But the problem is that it is deeply intertwined with the Indian government, and they will be reluctant to let it go. Any government decision that is politically feasible and that intends to stick through election cycles has to ensure that it deals with the tax problems of, and that of the railways‚Äô financial health.\xa0\n\nSolar‚Äôs Bright Future\n\nIndia‚Äôs solar capacity has been increasing at a rapid pace. From just 161 MW in 2010, it has increased to 34,000 MW in 2020. This is still short of the government‚Äôs target goal of 175,000 MW in 2022 but still a very large improvement from ten years ago. There are a few reasons why this has worked, according to interviews with industrialists. (Source [here](https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2021-07/mapping-india-energy-subsidies-2021.pdf) \\- chapter 5).\xa0\n\nThe first reason is reverse auctions. In a regular auction for any good, people submit goods and bid the price up. In a reverse auction people bid downwards, typically for the right to provide a service. This helps avoid corruption and increases confidence that the market is fair. India‚Äôs reverse auctions for solar have been a success. They have attracted large experienced foreign companies, have had competitive bidding and low prices. [An auction ](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/indias-stunning-solar-bid-rides-on-12-boosters/)in November 2020 sold the right to provide 1 GW of electricity, and that too for the lowest price in recent history.\xa0\n\nSecond, the government‚Äôs usage of solar parks has helped investors get financing and gain legibility in their projects.\xa0 For a project in a solar park, a developer can answer questions by banks and investors much better, and this makes it worth it despite the slightly higher cost.\xa0\n\nThese two have led to large increases in Indian solar capacity. That being said, there are still several challenges the industry faces, primarily driven by policy uncertainty from both state and central governments.\xa0\n\nFirst, state governments need to honor the contracts at the prices and terms set at reverse auctions. Solar prices have dropped over the years in India reflecting increasing investor interest and supply. As a result of this, state governments that had auctioned off electricity capacity in earlier years are now worse off because their competitor states are getting lower prices, while they are locked in with higher prices. State governments can complain, grumble and publicly lament their bad luck. Nobody gets hurt from that.\xa0\n\nBut what crosses the line is them cancelling already signed contracts because they can get lower prices elsewhere! Four state governments have done this in various forms. First it was Andhra Pradesh, cancelling previous Power Purchase Agreements despite the [protests](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/centre-asks-andhra-pradesh-to-continue-with-existing-ppas-in-clean-energy-sector/article27705159.ece) and [warnings](https://www.news18.com/news/politics/centre-urges-jagan-reddy-govt-not-to-cancel-ppas-of-chandrababu-naidu-regime-2229495.html) of the central government. Then it was Punjab [renegotiating the price](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/punjab-begins-renegotiation-of-solar-ppas/articleshow/87462710.cms?from=mdr) it got after the contract was signed. The Gujarat government [cancelled](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/explain-700-mw-dholera-project-bid-cancellation-mnre-asks-gujarat/articleshow/80759171.cms?from=mdr) a Letter of Intent and Uttar Pradesh cancelled[ a tender](https://renewablewatch.in/2021/06/03/uttar-pradesh-announces-cancellation-of-500-mw-solar-tender/#:~:text=Uttar%20Pradesh%20New%20and%20Renewable,lower%20tariffs%20in%20the%20future.) despite the price for it being set. These actions are damaging not only to the Indian governments‚Äô reputation with international investors, but also the general climate for the rule of law in India. They have already led to foreign investors [pulling out](https://india.mongabay.com/2021/06/flip-flop-in-policy-can-derail-indias-long-term-renewable-journey/) of India, and several gigawatts of solar contracts have already been cancelled. The correct policy solution for this is not obvious outside of state governments deciding to honor them, but the slow speed of the court process means that they can get away with it.\xa0\n\nSecond, there is the problem of import tariffs. Around 80% of solar panels used in India are imported from abroad - mainly China. The Indian government wants to reduce this and the urge to do so only went up after last May‚Äôs clashes. So, they have imposed two policies to reduce this. The first is a local content regulation - a rule that all government contracts to supply solar energy have to have locally made panels. Research [shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-020-0677-7.pdf) that these requirements led to 6% higher energy costs. The other more important policy is import tariffs. The government [has imposed](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/10/27/taxes-set-to-push-up-solar-energy-tariffs-in-india/#:~:text=The%20recent%20increase%20in%20the,increase%20project%20costs%20for%20developers.&amp;text=An%20Indian%20solar%20plant.) a 40% duty on panel imports with the intent of increasing domestic production. Indian solar panels are on average 33% more expensive than imported panels. While this had the intent of increasing production of solar power and developing domestic capacity, that didn‚Äôt happen. First it takes years to develop solar manufacturing and in the meantime between now and then, it is only going to increase solar energy prices hampering the transition. Second, foreign companies producing in India would not buy from Indian producers even if they have lower costs right away. They typically have a list of suppliers they trust and it will take time for Indian companies to enter this. The solar tariffs only make it more difficult for them to develop in India and depress their returns, with no increase in demand for domestic production.\xa0\n\nMost importantly, the barrier for domestic solar production according to interviews with developers is not that Indian costs are too high. It is that to develop economies of scale and invest in large quantities that drive down costs, Indian developers need demand certainty and integrating backwards the value chain. India‚Äôs low GDP growth before the pandemic led to slowing energy demand and state governments reneging on their contracts only made it worse. The long gestation period of such manufacturing facilities means that companies have to be absolutely certain of demand for their products.\n\nFinally, if the government insists on having domestic capacity for national security reasons, it is far better for them to subsidize production of domestic capacity across the supply chain to build high quality products that will match the standards of foreign suppliers than to tax imports. There are examples of this with the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme and Production Linked Incentive.\xa0\n\nThe future is a policy choice\n\nThere is a lot more to be said by the government on this. First, urbanization in India is going to increase over the coming decades. While the government has decided to consider sustainability in city planning in the [New Urban Agenda](https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/CountryNews/11213_UNHA_India_s_Statement_28.05.2019.pdf) forum, they have not stated any clear plans for mitigating the emissions impact of consumer good spending like ACs and refrigerators. Along with that, any government that wants to take bold policy moves regarding accelerating renewables will face strong political opposition.\xa0\n\nI am however, very much optimistic on India‚Äôs climate future. The reason for it is that **unlike almost any other major economy, the majority of India‚Äôs climate future is yet to be decided**. That means that there is still hope, and good public policy can change it.\n\n*I write at* [*https://brettongoods.substack.com*](https://brettongoods.substack.com/)*.

      <li>Title::: 'Help to fight vandalism'<br />Body: "(The following is composed by u/AyyappaBhakti and posted here with their permission as they don't have enough account time logged in to post here)\n\nHello/Vanakkam/Namaste Folks.\n\nThere exists a website called Fandom, where people can create websites related to stories.\n\nA few years ago, some good Hindus had created a fandom website for the Mahabharata, in good spirit. People can contribute new pages to it, and it served as a good spiritual website that catalogued various topics about the Mahabharata.\n\nHowever, in recent years, people have been vandalizing the website. On the descriptions of holy ancient characters, they put obscene words to destroy the Mahabharata.\n\nSo, my friends, please go to the fandom Mahabharata website and fight the vandalism. Many pages need to be cleaned up.\n\nCheck this out: https://mahabharata.fandom.com/wiki/Hiranyakashipu\n\nLook at the page history. There's many more webpages here that need to be fixed.\n\nYou may think this is a waste of time. But it is your duty to fight for religion.\n\nRegardless of your religion, it's important to help us. If the same vandalism happened to any other Indian religion, I'd be glad to help.\n\nLike Wikipedia, Fandom stores the IP addresses of the people who change/vandalize the site, so we know who's doing it. But that doesn't give us any power.\n\nHelp us out. Imagine how many spiritual seekers had to read this! Fight the vandalism to grow our religion.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will definitely try to bring petrol and diesel under GST if she gets the support of the state governments, said Gadkari\n\nBasically the center has been trying to increase public pressure to lower fuel taxes deliberately, and get the opposition talking about fuel prices. \n\nThe end goal is to have the state govts agree to put fuel under GST, so that this nationwide disparity in fuel taxes would go out of the window.\n\nIt will also mean that any changes in fuel taxation will no longer be ad-hoc and up to the whims of whichever central or state govt is in power, and only when the bulk of the GST council agrees, would they be able to alter those rates.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'qsal1k'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qsal1k/fuel_price_endgame_emerges_petrol_diesel_taxes/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Non-Desi but Desi by heart.'<br />Body: 'oh, good ol\' times when i was 11, aight, i got a crush on an Indian Man (Rohit Khandelwal) before, like, a huge crush before, which, leds me into knowing India, but hey, but when i knew India, even just for a bit, why did i just love it, why did i intuitively just relate and love it even though i have known a little yet?\n\nMaybe \'cause, i love the culture and it\'s people? That it seems very bright, colourful, lone wolves, happy-go-lucky, full of good and spiritual vibes, great artistry, creative, expressive (and also not shaming people who express themselves, some or cringe to me but it\'s fine and i appreciate it) which i find that it kind of has the same qualities as me. And yes, Desi Men are my type, like, a lot, *laugh out loud, i guess*. Even though, i haven\'t met any Desi people before physically, rather, digitally through social media, especially Instagram. \n\nThose times that i have tons of Indian music on my phone that are all downloaded via YouTube link to mp3. i don\'t remember what first Desi song i listened too, probably, "Kamariya" by the movie "Mitron." And those good times that i will just listen to that song again and again that it\'s just my huge favourite before. i remember one night before, probably 1am, where i just listen to it on my earphones again and again while bouncing on my bed, and "my mom" came into my room asking what was happening, and i acted like nothing was happening.\n\nSince Indian movies are the well-known thing across the world, i have a list before the movies that i want to watch on notes (but then "my mom" who\'s racist against Desi people removed it). And, i only watched one, and without subtitles, on YouTube, the movie "Mitron". *laugh out loud, i guess*. Desi songs are the only thing in me. \n\ni even want to wear Desi clothing, i want to wear the kurta, and the sikh turban (fortunately, it\'s permissible). i am so fascinated about Holi, it\'s so colorful, and vibeful, i wish i can celibate it. i also made a post greeting about Republic Day on Instagram. Through WikiHow, i followed some accessible instructions i can do to celebrate Diwali, the only thing i could do is clean my room, *laugh out loud, i guess*. And then i commented it on Facebook, and then the racist mom saw it, and got mad. \n\ni even planned before to settle in India, at Chandigarh, and study at Chandigarh University. \n\ni was learning Hindi, which i discontinued after on. I learned via Duolingo (which is by the way, really helpful for making You understand a language as a starter), and then, i also memorised additional Hindi words, which i all forgot right now. i even prayed to God to give me an Indian classmate or schoolmate (which is somehow cringe), with my kindergarten Hindi, *laugh out loud, i guess*. \n\ni even want to learn more about India, and across South Asia (which until now, i don\'t know quite a lot, but a bit little, but also familiar), which i also came across Pakistan and quite learned about kind of a bit into the Two-nation Theory. And hey, i liked Pakistan, primarily because of their Men and they\'re my type, *laugh out loud, i guess*. i am impressed by the Sikh religion and it\'s people because, often religion tells You to do good, but it seems they\'re the one who emphasised it the most. i wanted to learn a lot like the culture, clothing, and etc. Especially before (i also downloaded articles online to learn), but i really don\'t have the energy, that\'s why i don\'t know much. \n\ni even classified myself as, half Indian by heart, to Indian by heart, to Desi by heart.\n\nBut now, its strange, i am still fully aware and see Desi stuff digitally, but why am i not as interested as before? Why am i not as "Desi" as before? Maybe because, You know, time flies and goes by, we all change. Especially that, throughout those five years, i now changed a lot after that. A lot of major things happened and changed to me, which is really unexpected. \n\nEven though i don\'t mind about Desi stuff as much as before, it\'ll still have a part in me. The Desi Things are really the ones that kept me alive before, it\'s also part of me primarily. i don\'t know if i will continue to revive it, or it will just leave a small or moderate piece of me. i still want to learn, see, and be with it, even though it\'s not as much as before, because there\'s also a lot of primary things that i have to focus on instead. And/or maybe, it\'s also will be one of the primary Great Things that are part of me like before, but not just about "being in the Desi", but also will still have the other primary Great Things to me that i also have to focus with.\n\nBut i won\'t force myself, i will just let my natural true me evolve, wether i would still "be in the Desi" or not as much. it\'s also up to God and i have trust of Him too, He leads me to unexpected Great Things.\n\nMaybe that\'s all, because, i might also come back and add or change a some things in this post too, *laugh out loud, i guess*.\n\nby the way, i love some artists like Darshan Raval, Diljit Dosanjh, Guru Randhawa, Arijit Singh, Nikk, Jass Manak, Asim Azhar, and many more. i often listen to Punjabi and Hindi, with some from Urdu, Telungu, and Gujarati. Kind of sadly that i don\'t listen as much as before though. Before, i listen and have more Desi music than Western ones.'<br />Author: 'HUZNAIN'  id: 'qsa7s2'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qsa7s2/nondesi_but_desi_by_heart/</li>

It deals with why a Police Battalion composed of ordinary middle class, middle aged men, not the SS, committed massacres and round-ups of Jews for deportations to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland in 1942. The men of Unit 101 were not ardent Nazis but ordinary middle-aged men of working class background from Hamburg, who had been drafted but found ineligible for regular military duty. After their return to occupied Poland in June 1942, the men were ordered to terrorize the Jewish people in the ghettos during Operation Reinhard and carry out massacres of Polish Jewish population (men, women and children) in the towns of J√≥zef√≥w and ≈Åomazy.\n\nThe conclusion of the book says that the men of Unit 101 killed out of **obedience** to authority and **peer pressure**.\n\nIt got me thinking, why did the troops open fired in Jalianwala Bagh on unarmed civilians ? And what was the composition of the troops that actually pulled the trigger ?

      <li>Title::: 'Case Study of why India needs more robust whistleblower protection law'<br />Body: "Nishith Desai Associates is a leading international law firm in India. It became a leading law firm in International Tax by specializing in Mauritius route. Few years back a whistleblower got hold of some incriminating documents revealing how this law firm has been abetting large scale tax evasion and approached law enforcement agencies with these documents. When the law firm got a sniff of this, it used its influence on the judiciary to block any inquiry against it and came down with a ton of bricks on the whistleblowever by abusing the legal system. It directly approached a Delhi High Court judge directly in his chamber, by passed the registry and due process to institute a confidential suit (CS(OS) 67/2020) against the whistleblower. It also got the judge to pass an ex-parte order to allow the law firm to raid the house of the whistleblower and seize all his computers and mobile phones. The order provided unlimited power to the law firm to do whatever it wished to in the house of the whistleblower. This suit and the order was kept confidential, so much so that the pseudonyms were used for the parties and the entire court file was kept in a sealed cover. The whistleblower was not even heard.\n\nI used to be part of the firm and have seen these developments from close quarter. I have penned this story in form of a wordpress blog **'The Fall of Nishith Desai'** (link to the blog at the bottom) which is best read bottom to top. I have reproduced the relevant chapters pertaining to the whistleblower harrassment below: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Towards the end of 2019, Parul Jain was back at NDA. Nishithbhai‚Äôs ego had gotten a boost and he was not restraining himself from bragging that someone who had quit NDA to join a large and leading accounting firm, had come back to the ‚ÄúNDA family‚Äù, as he likes to call the firm.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, surprisingly there were no public announcements. Nishithbhai, PR saavy that he is, always ensures that such news gets published in the media. But in this case there was a complete silence. So much so that Parul‚Äôs name was not even added to the list of firm members on the NDA‚Äôs website, which is far better maintained than any other law firm in India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As we, lowly members of the firm, were to later find out, Nishithbhai had learned about ‚ÄúThe Leak‚Äú. It it difficult for me to say if he learned it from his pals in the investigative agencies with whom Advocate Prashant Bhushan had shared this information, or it was Parul who informed him, though latter seems very unlikely.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For a couple of months we noticed nothing unusual. But things changed in February of 2020. No, it was not the outbreak of COVID-19 at NDA. It was worse. Initially, we noticed that Nishithbhai and senior ‚Äòpartners‚Äô (Gowree Gokhale, Pratibha Jain, Vaibhav Parikh from New York) having frantic parlays which also involved Parul. Subsequently some of us were also roped in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nishithbhai had come up with a plan to plug ‚ÄúThe Leak‚Äù ‚Äì a plan that eventually turned out to be a total disaster. He decided that NDA will file a case against Parul‚Äôs husband alleging that he had stolen the data from Parul‚Äôs official laptop and was now blackmailing NDA to fire her, or else he will put that data in public domain and tarnish NDA‚Äôs reputation. Parul happily gave a statement to this effect, on the basis of which a case was prepared.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most of us advised Nishithbhai to abandon the plan and instead strike a deal with Parul‚Äôs husband or Adv Bhushan. Or just disown the leaked data, if the need ever arises. But Gowree supported the plan and Nishithbhai decided to go ahead with it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was crucial that this case had to be kept confidential as it would have been fatal if the clients came to know of the leak. The objective was to use shock and awe, and intimidate Parul‚Äôs husband. This is where the unmatched research capability of NDA came in handy. The firm can find solutions in law, which are generally unknown. Instead of filing a criminal complaint for theft and defamation, which would be very difficult to keep confidential, we figured out that a civil suit would work better.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Delhi High Court, inspired by the US and UK jurisprudence, had constituted confidentiality club in some matters pertaining to Intellectual Property disputes. Further, under the CPC the Hon‚Äôble Court has the power to allow filing of a suit under pseudonyms and to hear the matter in camera. So a civil suit was prepared claiming that ex husband of an employee had unauthorized possession of the firm‚Äôs intellectual property, was misusing it and had defamed the firm before its clients thereby causing a reputational and financial loss to the firm. Parul gladly gave a statement against her ex husband, and this was made the basis of this suit. Statements were obtained from couple of friendly clients to the effect that Parul‚Äôs husband had approached them and defamed NDA. It was decided that the suit would be filed by the Delhi office of NDA and damages in excess of Rs 2 crore will be sought, in order to make it within the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court (which had confidentiality club precedents).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The suit was filed in pseudonyms ‚Äì Anuradha Vs. Bajrangi. This was no ordinary filing. NMD wanted it to be a foolproof operation. The registry was bypassed. A friendly judge in Rajiv Sahai Endlaw was identified. A couple of lawyers from NDA along with a senior counsel approached him in his chambers to bring the suit directly before him. The paperbook was handed in a sealed cover and Rajiv Sahai Endlaw admitted the suit Anuradha Vs. Bajrangi without even verification of the paperbook. The prayers to institute the suit in pseudonym and keeping the paperbook (and memo of parties) in a sealed cover were granted. Verbal prayers were made for formation of a confidentiality club, holding proceedings in camera and an ex-parte issuance of a commission to seize all the electronic devices from the residence and office of the defendant i.e. Bajrangi (Parul‚Äôs husband). The judge granted all these verbal prayers in an order that he passed in his chambers. The Commissioner and Plaintiff were also given unbridled powers during this search and seizure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The commission was executed on the very next day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nishithbhai was convinced that he could use shock and awe to intimidate Parul‚Äôs husband (henceforth referred to as ‚ÄòBajrangi‚Äò). Brute force was displayed during the execution of the commission, or the search and seizure operation or the raid, whatever one might call it. A massive search party entered Banjrangi‚Äôs house early in the morning at 7AM. This party comprised of several NDA personnel, cops, ‚Äòauditors‚Äô from PwC and the appointed Court commissioner ‚Äì around 15 persons in total. Even the NDA colleagues who were part of this search team admit that the manner in which this raid was conducted was a more rough than it had to be.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bajrangi‚Äôs house was ransacked and all his electronic devices we seized ‚Äì even his phones. The idea was to scare the hell out of him, so that he would not dare to take on the Goliath even in his dreams. The NDA personnel who were part of the raid team directly threatened Bajrangi that if he shares the NDA‚Äôs data with anyone, then NDA would legally carpet bomb him and make his life miserable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But this had a completely opposite effect. Bajrangi, instead of being intimidated, declared to the raid team (including the Court commissioner) that he will now ensure that NDA is destroyed. Thus it turned out to be an act of stupidity by NDA ‚Äì the complaints that Bajrangi and Adv Bhushan had filed with the agencies were possibly languishing, but by initiating such a coercive action, NDA had ‚Äúwoken up the sleeping giant‚Äù.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bajrangi made an appearance in the suit through one of the top senior counsel of the Delhi High Court. He was willing to splurge money on this suit. NDA opened up some back channels to settle this matter but it could not get Bajrangi to agree with its conditions for withdrawing the suit. NDA even tried to pressurize him through the Court but he did not wilt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next was the audit of seized devices of Bajarangi as had been directed by the Court. Bajrangi was directed to be present during this exercise. He was called several times to the auditor‚Äôs office and made to remain present there for the entire day. We along with the Court commissioner tried our level best and all possible tricks to crack him, but all in vain. Not only did he possess excellent knowledge of computers, but he also had a decent understanding of law. He knew that there were limits to the powers of the Court commissioner, and he did not let us do anything in the audit exercise that was outside the scope of the Court order. Consequently, we found nothing useful for our suit during that audit exercise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;NDA‚Äôs objectives from this search and seizure, in addition to intimidation, were to discover with whom all Bajrangi had already shared the data and also to destroy one particular hard disk which was the primary device on which Parul had copied all the stolen data. Unfortunately, the search party could not seize this hard disk because Bajrangi had already moved it to Adv Bhushan‚Äôs office prior to the raid. We tried to get Bajrangi to handover that hard disk to us during the audit exercise but he kept on evading our demand. We even got the Court to pass an order directing Bajrangi to handover that hard disk to the Court commissioner. He, instead of complying with that order, got that hard disk delivered through Adv Bhushan to the Supreme Court Monitored Committee for Black Money (also known as the Black Money Commission), and filed an affidavit that since the hard disk was with the Black Money Commission, he is unable to produce that hard disk. We were all stumped. Not only had we failed to get possession of the hard disk, but also now this matter was before the Black Money Commission. This was bad for the reputation of the firm and also jeopardized the clients whose confidential data was there on that hard disk. Our moves had backfired, very badly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was the time to cool down, for damage control perhaps through withdrawal of the suit. But Nishithbhai was so pissed at the audacity of Bajrangi that he instructed us to continue pressing the suit. Bajrangi responded by making several damaging counter allegations that the NDA‚Äôs objectives were to destroy evidence of tax evasion which it had abetted and to impede investigation into its wrong doings. He further alleged that this was a collusive suit between NDA and his estranged wife (i.e. Parul) against their common enemy i.e. Bajrangi.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And then on the morning of July 13, 2021, a nuclear bomb was dropped on NDA and Nishithbhai. One newspaper ‚Äì The Pioneer published a front page story on this suit. The story was titled India‚Äôs ‚ÄòPanama Papers‚Äô on shell firms, tax loopholes gather dust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There were explicit details of how this suit was brought directly in the chambers of the judge, how NDA had abused the process of law by getting an ex parte order to raid the ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äôs‚Äù house and tried to beat him down. It also questioned why this suit was proceeding under a confidentiality club. All in all, it made NDA the villain of the piece.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The story went on to publish the details of how the data revealed tax fraud by some of the top clients of NDA and several damaging allegations from the complaints of Adv Prashant Bhushan. It also mentioned that this data was with ED and CBDT, and they had failed to take suitable action, and now the matter had reached the Black Money Commission.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In one stroke NDA had gone from being the marquee international tax advisory firm to being compared with the tainted and now dead firm Mossack &amp; Fonseca. Nishithbhai was shell-shocked, and so was everyone else in the firm. Soon some of the clients started calling and then the media. The ‚ÄúSone ki Lanka‚Äù had been burnt down.\n\nSource: [https://nishithdesaiassociates.wordpress.com](https://nishithdesaiassociates.wordpress.com)"<br />Author: 'theysai'  id: 'qquix3'<br />Score:32<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qquix3/case_study_of_why_india_needs_more_robust/</li>

As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to Contents for other chapters*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/wiki/mahalingamscorner#wiki_the_great_empire) | [*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/8/The-Great-Empire)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*   \n\n**‚Äî1.6. Clandestine operations‚Äî**\n\nPabbata‚Äôs grip tightened on the hilt of his sword, and his face had turned pale in horror. \n\nAll five guards had prostrated themselves before him, claiming their innocence and begging for his forgiveness.\n\n‚ÄúWhose mercy do you wish for?‚Äù the prince asked through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúMine, or my father‚Äôs?‚Äù\n\nThe guards continued to wail incoherently. He kicked one who had grabbed his ankle.\n\nNot only was this threatening to ruin all of Pabbata‚Äôs plans, this would seriously damage his image in his father‚Äôs eyes, even if Pabbata had had nothing to do with Chanakya‚Äôs escape nor the security of his imprisonment, because the emperor now viewed Chanakya and all the problems surrounding him as among Pabbata‚Äôs affairs.\n\n‚ÄúListen here,‚Äù he pronounced, ‚ÄúYou wish for my mercy? You will have it. I will tell father that it was on my orders that you released Chanakya from his cell. And this is what you will tell everyone as well ‚Äì your friends, your family, everyone. I shall not reveal to any of them the truth of your incompetence.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are grateful, O kind prince, we are gra‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I have two conditions,‚Äù Pabbata interjected with a fierce glare. ‚ÄúOne, obviously, the five of you shall be my slaves in this life and the next six, heeding every word of mine. And two: \n\n‚Äú*Find Chanakya!*‚Äù\n\nHigh birth, godliness, heroism, seeing through the eyes of elders, virtue, truthfulness, non-contradiction, gratefulness, high goals, enthusiasm, non-procrastination, power, resolute mind, an assembly of viceless ministers, a taste for discipline; these are the qualities of an inviting nature. \n\nInquiry, hearing, perception, retention in memory, reflection, deliberation, inference and steadfast adherence to conclusions are the qualities of the intellect. \n\nValour, determination of purpose, quickness, and probity are the aspects of enthusiasm. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Sharp intellect, strong memory, keen mind, energy, power, training in all the arts, vicelessness, justice, dignity, preparedness, foresight, readiness to avail himself of afforded opportunities in respect of place, time, and manly efforts, cleverness to discern the cause for peace treaty or war, capacity to make jokes without loss of dignity or secrecy, never brow-beating and casting haughty and stern looks, freedom from passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness, haste and back-biting habits, a smiling demeanour, observance of elders‚Äô customs; such is the nature of self-possession.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 6.1:2-6\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nChanakya wasn‚Äôt too worried about getting caught.\n\nThe fastest route out of Pataliputra was the Northern Highway, so he would be alerted in advance of any search party sent in pursuit of him, and he simply had to hide in the bushes while it passed. He considered that a kingdom ought to have a better alert system, such as a sequence of lighthouses to be lit in succession along the highway, or simply conch-blowers placed at regular intervals.\n\nWhat Chanakya was more concerned about was him *voluntarily* submitting to capture.\n\nAlthough he had broken out of prison on his own accord anyway, he was fairly certain that Pabbata had been making some sort of effort to have him pardoned, for whatever purpose that he sought Chanakya for. Based on the interaction that Chanakya had observed earlier between Dhanananda and his son, Chanakya estimated a high chance of this attempt succeeding. \n\nThe question then arose, of how the search party would approach precisely.\n\nThere were several possibilities.\n\nOne, a standard search party may approach, should Dhanananda‚Äôs men be the first to discover Chanakya missing, or should Pabbata tell his father about Chanakya‚Äôs escape and Dhanananda be responsive to this information in this way. In this case, Chanakya merely had to hide, then bother about contacting Pabbata after safely making it to Taxila.\n\nTwo, if Pabbata initiated the search himself, he might do so under his own name, clearly announcing his intent at various cities on the highway. In this case, Chanakya would need to stalk him until he could isolate Pabbata and confront him himself, having prepared a decent escape plan.\n\nThree, Pabbata may initiate the search under one of his brothers‚Äô names, as a search for *both* Pabbata and Chanakya who had escaped ‚Äì this way, the emperor wouldn‚Äôt learn of Chanakya‚Äôs escape and simply assume there was some disagreement between brothers. In this case, Chanakya would need to first *find* Pabbata himself, then stalk and isolate him, having prepared a decent escape plan.\n\nFour, Pabbata may initiate the search under some entirely different pretense, such as a search for child slaves, or a survey of recent migrants to each city ‚Äì or even, having gathered the information from those who guarded the gates of Pataliputra, a registration of Ajivika monks. Thus Chanakya had to avoid entering walled cities, instead monitoring the happenings from the outside.\n\n(And Chanakya acknowledged, in some corner of his mind, that this was how he had to think ‚Äì to consider every possibility that may arise, and decide on the optimal course of action in response, and to consider every possible hurdle in that course of action, the response to that, and thus so.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*If a chief among the neighbouring kings seems to give trouble, the minister may invite him, saying "come here and I shall make thee king," and then put him to death.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 5.6:16\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter making precautions to meet in a forested tract where Pabbata‚Äôs cavalry companions couldn‚Äôt easily pursue him, and having made plans for escape (such a severed log that he could push into a pond to feign that he had jumped into it, should he be pursued), and having found an opportune moment where Pabbata was isolated from his army ‚Äì as an archer isolated his target from a phalanx to shoot him, or as a man isolated a courtesan from her ill-mannered companions to court her ‚Äì Chanakya showed himself to Pabbata. \n\n‚ÄúChanakya!‚Äù Pabbata cried, then cringed. ‚ÄúAnd do you *have* to maintain that appearance?‚Äù\n\nChanakya accepted the dhoti. ‚ÄúI assume that if you sought to return me to my prison, you would have hardly gone to the trouble of all this pretense to capture me. I will answer to your demands, but you must first dismiss your army.‚Äù\n\nThe Magadhan prince made a questioning gesture. ‚ÄúYou believe that if you could escape my friends if I ordered them to capture you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI broke out of Pataliputra‚Äôs highest-security dungeons, designed by Ajatashatru himself. Do you truly believe that I couldn‚Äôt escape three kids the same age as myself?‚Äù\n\nPabbata nodded, then turned to his minion. ‚ÄúDevajit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDo as he says. I will be away from Magadha for an extended period of time as previously discussed; in that time, you shall be my messenger and representative in Pataliputra.‚Äù \n\nThen he turned to his other, younger minion: ‚ÄúYou will accompany me, Chandragupta.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n  **‚Äî1.7. The art of double crossing‚Äî**\n\n‚ÄúWell?‚Äù\n\nPabbata smirked internally, proud at the cleverness of his dealings. By telling has father openly that he would ask for Chanakya‚Äôs support in a fratricidal war, he was able to frankly deal with Chanakya while maintaining plausible deniability for any report that might reach his father.\n\n*Ha, fool! You may have fooled your father ‚Äì well, even your mother probably fooled your father ‚Äì but you cannot fool me ‚Äì I am fully familiar with the art of double-crossing. You have previously spoken to your father on this proposition that you will bring to me, giving some sort of excuse, such as ‚ÄúI will portray myself as an enemy of Magadha, and spy for you and for my brothers‚Äù while privately leaving open to yourself both options of alliance and treachery.*\n\nThat is what Chanakya would have said, if instead of truly desirous to exercise cunning, Chanakya had only cared to *appear* cunning, as ordinary people did. But it was far more advantageous to continue to appear na√Øve, to make Pabbata complacent, and to respond in a manner that was consistent with his expectations.\n\nHe placed his foot on a protruding boulder, and spoke slowly. \n\n‚ÄúI have always said, Pabbata, that a fool is not one who does not know the truth; a fool is one who fails to recognize the truth even after it is shown to him most explicitly in its most glorious form. By recognizing my capacities as Dhanananda did not, you have proven yourself to be in possession of the quality that I seek in my dearest friends. Thus, I shall agree to associate with you.‚Äù\n\nPabbata smiled, but seemed expectant.\n\n*You desire not only my intellect as an ally, but also my instruction in the sciences, seeking to use only that instruction that will grant your political victory and subsequent security while neglecting my moral instruction. You have not expressed this desire in these words, so as to deceive me into believing I have imposed a condition on you, when I demand it from you for my own purposes. Well, let me accept this unspoken request ‚Äì for there is no means by which you could defeat me in the game we are about to play.*\n\n‚ÄúBut you have had a Magadhi upbringing, and this cannot be neglected,‚Äù Chanakya continued, carefully observing the prince‚Äôs reaction and smiling internally at his observations. ‚ÄúThus, I will require that you enrol at the University of Taxila ‚Äì there, over the course of the next several years leading up to the war you intend to wage, I will teach you the sciences and the Vedas, and we shall form a detailed plan to plot your rise to power.‚Äù\n\nChanakya was aware that playing the game against Pabbata would be risky.\n\nThe dignified persona that Pabbata wore in Chanakya‚Äôs presence was not representative of his true character ‚Äì that much was certain. Chanakya was sure that when the time came, Pabbata wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to capture him and take him to Pataliputra if he decided treachery to be more profitable than alliance at that time. \n\nThere was also the distinct possibility that Dhanananda‚Äôs irrational anger and sentencing was itself a conspiracy by Pabbata to manipulate Chanakya to join his side. No honourable standards could be expected of a man who had a barbarian upbringing, no depth could be assumed lower than which he wouldn‚Äôt stoop ‚Äì and conversely, no such standards ought to be respected by civilized men in a fight against barbarians, for to abide by rules that your opponents didn‚Äôt was equal to accepting defeat.\n\nBut Chanakya would hardly reject Pabbata‚Äôs offer ‚Äì there was much benefit to be had in securing a powerful ally, even an unreliable one, and Chanakya had to first enter the game that he wished to play.\n\n‚ÄúI accept your conditions,‚Äù said Pabbata. \n\nAnd thus the game had begun.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the tail of a dog which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites of insects.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt took them a week to reach the country of the Panchalas, which lied on the Western-most border of Magadha‚Äôs imperial extent.\n\nHalf the journey still remained.\n\nHaving had spent some time with both Pabbata and Chandragupta, Chanakya had obtained a sense of both their personalities, and had observed a considerable intellect and curiosity in Chandragupta that he had not expected in a minion whose life had been sworn to loyalty. It was a far stretch, and by no means a certainty, but it was worth exploring multiple plans in case one didn‚Äôt come to fruition as expected.\n\nOf course, Chanakya could hardly be seen dealing directly with Chandragupta, nor could he risk Chandragupta reporting such a conversation directly to Pabbata. \n\nThus the adoption of the posture of a double-crosser: the art of betraying a friend in plain sight.\n\nChanakya drank the last drop of water from his vessel, claiming to be parched. When Chandragupta had left to find water, Chanakya spoke to Pabbata.\n\n‚ÄúThere are many reasons why a typical prince prefers to have multiple allies flanking them at university, one such reason being that it is harder for a group to maintain a conspiracy than for a single person. Are you so sure of Chandragupta‚Äôs loyalty to you?‚Äù\n\nPabbata smirked. ‚ÄúI assure you, Chanakya, that there is no tactic known to man that could sway Chandragupta on the quality of loyalty.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI will bet you one *pana* \\[1\\] that I could.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Pabbata raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWell, Chanakya, if you are successful in eliciting from Chandragupta‚Äôs mouth a single sentence about me that is anything short of unqualified praise, I shall give you a hundred panas.‚Äù Then he added: ‚ÄúIn addition, of course, to Chandragupta‚Äôs severed head.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*When the profit accruing to kings under an agreement, whether they be of equal, inferior, or superior power, is equal to all, that agreement is termed peace; when unequal, it is termed defeat. Such is the nature of peace and war.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 7.8:34\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter Pabbata excused himself with some effortlessly produced excuse, Chanakya spoke to Chandragupta. As the standard initiation of conversation, he asked:\n\n‚ÄúWhat caste and country are you of?‚Äù\n\nChandragupta looked surprised. ‚ÄúI am of Ayodhya, and of Vaishya blood,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúOh? How did you come to befriend Pabbata?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was out of his kindness that the prince offered me his friendship when we met,‚Äù said Chandragupta.\n\nChanakya paused for a moment to calculate the most acceptable way to prod further. ‚ÄúDoes the prince leave Pataliputra so often? That must be quite dangerous, especially with assassinations having become a children‚Äôs sport.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Chandragupta answered. ‚ÄúWe met in Pataliputra.‚Äù\n\nChanakya paused again to think. ‚ÄúWell, you must be quite thankful for that visit.‚Äù\n\nChandragupta didn‚Äôt answer.\n\n*I see.*\n\n‚ÄúI noticed you haven‚Äôt yet written or sent a message to your parents about your move to Taxila. Surely Pabbata would be willing to sponsor a messenger; what‚Äôs of them?‚Äù\n\nChandragupta looked hesitant to answer again, but eventually admitted:\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre dead.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs what Chanakya had guessed. And if the remainder of his guess was true as well ‚Ä¶ \n\nHe nodded sympathetically. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how did your parents die?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey were executed.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ by the vassal king of Kosala?‚Äù\n\nChandragupta shook his head.\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n(Chanakya took this time to decide exactly how much time he ought to wait for before initiating the truly important conversation. When he judged that enough time had passed, he spoke.)\n\n‚ÄúDo not take this as any form of instigation, Chandragupta,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúNor of ill-will against anyone. But if Dhanananda killed your parents, why do you work for his son?‚Äù\n\nChandragupta shot him an offended look, then spoke the longest sentence that Chanakya had heard from the kid‚Äôs mouth yet. ‚ÄúIs it equally immoral, then, for you to associate with Pabbata for his father‚Äôs sin of killing my parents? Or is it only *I* who ought to care about my parents, so that each man merely makes an enemy out of those whose associates have personally harmed him?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Chanakya agreed, ‚ÄúThat would make it quite easy to be wicked, by simply committing wicked acts, then dividing them among a number of messengers.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFurthermore, I have no intention to avenge my parents‚Äô deaths as such; and Pabbata is not responsible for my parents‚Äô deaths. Pabbata offered me shelter and employment in a time of grief and chaos, and for this I shall always be thankful.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf it is his provision of shelter and employment to you that is the basis of your loyalty to him, would you switch your loyalties to someone who provides you with superior of the same, or who provides you with other forms of material wealth that you desire more?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt would be most senseless to confess to such an outlook,‚Äù said Chandragupta, ‚ÄúAnd most disloyal to possess one.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd you possess this quality of loyalty?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have always been loyal to my master as long as I have had one, and desire to maintain this habit for as long as I will have one.‚Äù\n\nIt was subtle, but every one of Chandragupta‚Äôs words had been precisely what Chanakya had wished to hear. He had not spoken a word in foolish emotionality, whether against his master or in his defence, instead maintaining dignified restraint. He had shown himself to be motivated by goals higher than mere revenge, and to possess a notion of kinship that extended beyond his mere family and tribe. \n\nChanakya had not yet truly articulated, even mentally, that he was testing both Pabbata and Chandragupta as prospective future emperors of Magadha. His ambitions ‚Äì and relief to the troubles that ailed the country ‚Äì did not strictly require preserving an imperial Magadha as such; there was the desire of many scholars at Taxila to return to the period of Mahajanapadas, to the state of affairs that had persisted before Ajatashatru‚Äôs conquests. \n\nYet Chanakya noted subconsciously that Chandragupta, in short conversation, had demonstrated numerous qualities that were desirable in a king, and none of such vices. He also noted that being of Ayodhya, Chandragupta would likely be acceptable as a king to the people of Magadha, who viewed Ayodhya as being of their own country even if the people of Ayodhya did not return that view.\n\nThere was just one question to confirm or deny Chanakya‚Äôs impression of the boy.\n\n‚ÄúAnd do you believe Pabbata returns your loyalty? He and his family live in a magnificent palace ‚Äì he does not see you as deserving of any such amenities; indeed, he sees you as one of these amenities yourself.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWould my life be substantially improved if Pabbata were deprived of these amenities? Regardless of the differences between my view of him and his of me, the truth remains that my life would be substantially worse if I were to disassociate from Pabbata on count of either envy or vengefulness.‚Äù \n\n*Indeed*, thought Chanakya, *It is a fallacy to expect any associate ‚Äì whether an ally, a friend, or a lover ‚Äì to provide you with precisely the same as what you provided them with. As usual, an economic perspective helped shed light on this: an ‚Äúequal‚Äù relationship is akin to paying a grocer in precisely the same goods that you receive from him ‚Äì this benefits neither you nor the seller, it is entirely fruitless, and merely a waste of time and effort. If you desire the same provision from your associate as you provide them, then you could as well provide it to yourself.*\n\n*However, even if the precise provisions of each party differ, it is just for the total value, as measured in gold, of the gain to each party to be equal ‚Äì when they are unequal, a friendship transcends into a game of victory and defeat. Thus, just as one desires to purchase goods at the lowest price possible and to sell goods at the highest, one must seek to increase the benefits that he receives from his friends.* \n\nThis was the quality of ‚Äúambition‚Äù, which was perhaps the most essential quality in a king. Chandragupta had not demonstrated this quality; yet if he was truly of Vaishya blood, the desire to acquire wealth had to be innate to him, and merely suppressed by his slavery to Pabbata.\n\nChandragupta noticed Chanakya deep in thought, and raised his eyebrows. \n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúWhat will you tell Pabbata?‚Äù\n\nChanakya smiled very widely.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Negligence to rescue a person under the clutches of a tiger shall be punished with a fine of 12 panas. Similar sum of money shall be given as a reward to him who kills a tiger.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, in the Arthashastra, 4.3:30-32\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‚ÄúI must applaud your sensibility in making and securing friends,‚Äù Chanakya said to Pabbata‚Äôs smirk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay up once we reach Taxila.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*    \n\n\\[1\\] *Pana* ‚Äì ancient Indian currency'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'qqqln1'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qqqln1/the_great_empire_ch_1_takshashila_khanda_167/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Fuckerys that happen in IT/ITES work environment ***Trigger Warning***'<br />Body: '**** NSFW - Trigger Warning ****\n\nI have been in  the IT/ITES industry for the past 20 years and the amount of bullshits and fuckerys that happen in IT service sector is astounding. All most all of them does not come to public view.. I know many of Indian work environment faces these things but IT sector is viewed as the teetotaler of Indian work sector.  But the reality is very very ugly. I will list few incidents in the hundreds of incident I have seen over the years in TOP IT service companies. \n\n\n* 2003/2004 - Manager A is in charge of critical project which has sure shot long term onsite. He exclusively hires only women employees such that 90% of his team are women. His women team leads should have "open mind" and should regularly visit resorts with him. The benefit? Long term onsite at a peaceful US city. One new hire girl tries to commit suicide in office bathroom because of his harassment. And the punishment the HR gave was long term onsite for the Manager A. In US also he continued his antics and was soon honey trapped by FBI when he tried to meet a 10 year old girl alone. Company spends a ungodly amount of money to keep the news out and engages high level diplomats to get him to India. Once in India, he was rewarded with x amount to keep quite and was let go. No news agency touched this story when presented. \n\n* 2007/2008  - Employee A comes to office, works for half day, has lunch with team mates, goes to bathroom and commits "suicide" by jumping from TOP floor of the office building. Many of his team mates who saw him laughing 10 mins before, see the body hitting the floor and his brains splattered on the walkway. Company quickly acted and before even ambulance arrives, threw/loaded his body into office cab and takes to hospital where he was declared dead. The blood was washed even before police arrived and nobody was allowed outside till every inch was scrubbed. Company declares he committed suicide. Manager did not allow any of his colleagues to accompany the body or go his home and directs them to continue working. Later Manager quips that "He did a disservice to team by committing suicide when there is more work and we are already short on resources". New agencies refused to report even when shown his suicide photo. \n\n* 2011/2012 - Manager A was a sadistic psycho. His team lead B was a saint and tries to protect juniors from the psycho. Manager wants his team lead gone, so he underestimates a 800 hours project work as 400 hours and conveniently forgot to inform his team lead of the project itself. 10 days before project due date (which was unchangeable due to regulatory nature) Manager, informs team lead of the project. Team could not finish the project on time and the Team lead was fired and was blacklisted(yes blacklisting is true). He could not land any job in India and is forced to exit India itself. \n\n* 2014/2015 - Manager A was a good soul. He fights for his juniors, encourages them, spend his own money to provide treat, provides 1 week unofficial work from home every month to all his women employees and makes sure everyone has work life balance etc. Many of his peers did not like the praise he is getting from underlings and complains to HR. Soon HR forces Manager A to hire a talent-less girl in his team. Manager A accepts because he is a good soul and tries his best to train her. After 3 months, new talent-less girl accuses Manager A of sexual harassment. Everyone in his team knows its bullshit and complains to HR but HR was not ready to investigate or hear any of his employees. HR gave only one option to Manager A, Resign or get fired.. Manage A resigns.\n\n* 2020/2021 - This is the story that prompted this post. Women Manager A was a Natural talent in both technical and people management aspect. She is one of the most awarded person in company. Within 5 years she grew from lowly team lead to group Manager and was on fast track to executive level. Her onsite peers encouraged her to complete MBA for jumping to Executive level and she completed it with many offers but choose to stay in the same company. Her Indian peers did not like a junior girl "skipping the queue". 4 of them complained to HR that she offered sexual favors to get promotion. HR did no investigation and simply gifted her pink slip one day before Diwali. While her Indian peers rejoiced, her onsite manager flew into a rage and threaten to complaint to director level if they did not restore her. After the threat, it was revealed that one of the executive was behind this and simple did not like a "darkie, curry eater" at executive level. With her career ruined Manger A tried to commit suicide and is currently in hospital. \n\n\nI have seen many more fuckery but it will be too depressing to type. I will leave with one more fuckery that happened in my cousin work place. He is with a famous Jeweler who has many branches all over India. Everyday, each and every piece of jewel is counted and accounted for before closing. New girl joins a branch. Manager and supervisor forces her to stay late and count the jewels. When everyone left, manager and supervisor accuse her of theft and said some jewel is missing. New girl afraid of police and bad name, begged them that she did not steal anything. Manager and supervisor decided to strip search her and rapes her all night in the store itself. Next day, the girl was found bleeding and was admitted to local hospital. Police was called and girl\'s family is threatened with dire consequences if they report it to news. Both manager and supervisor was given stern talking to and shifted to different branch. Police got paid off and a girls life is destroyed. \n\nWhat are some of the fuckery that you know?'<br />Author: 'sco_black_scorpio'  id: 'qqqb36'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qqqb36/fuckerys_that_happen_in_itites_work_environment/</li>

Few years back a whistleblower got hold of some incriminating documents revealing how this law firm has been abetting large scale tax evasion and approached law enforcement agencies with these documents. When the law firm got a sniff of this, it used its influence on the judiciary to block any inquiry against it and came down with a ton of bricks on the whistleblowever by abusing the legal system. It directly approached a Delhi High Court judge directly in his chamber, by passed the registry and due process to institute a confidential suit (CS(OS) 67/2020) against the whistleblower. It also got the judge to pass an ex-parte order to allow the law firm to raid the house of the whistleblower and seize all his computers and mobile phones. The order provided unlimited power to the law firm to do whatever it wished to in the house of the whistleblower. This suit and the order was kept confidential, so much so that the pseudonyms were used for the parties and the entire court file was kept in a sealed cover. The whistleblower was not even heard.\n\nI used to be part of the firm and have seen these developments from close quarter.

From Los Angeles Herald, 1908. "Caste in India"'<br />Body: '#"Since the days of Asoka Hindustan has prospered only under the rule of foreigners, and so it must be until caste is abolished and the spirit of brotherhood made possible, a condition that cannot come about short of a century." \n\nRetrieved by Hindoo History:\n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1457443361997025282.html\n\n"When the Aryan nomads crossed the Himalayas and formed their pastoral settlements along the banks of the Indus they were a peaceful people, yielding easily to the governance of their patriarchal chiefs."\n\n"When the Aryan nomads crossed the Himalayas and formed their pastoral settlements along the banks of the Indus they were a peaceful people, yielding easily to the governance of their patriarchal chiefs."\n\n"And to the lowest of these-- measured by worldly standards-- one may see some wealthy Jat landowner or some prosperous Gujerati grain dealer bow with deference, as to one immeasurably superior to himself in the account of the gods. Caste outweighs wealth and station" \n"The Gaekwar of Baroda wears the star of India, and his comings and goings are marked by a salute of 21 guns, but the Brahman who begs at the gates of his palace would be degraded by sitting at his table..." \n\n"When we come down to the lower ranks of the people, the ramifications of caste are beyond the grasp of mind. Every occupation has its distinct caste and these are varied by locality."\n\n"Then there are hundreds of castes growing out of mixed marriages for, although Hindu custom now forbids marriages between persons of different caste, there has been extensive intermingling, and in every such case the contracting parties lost their original caste." \n"In many instances non-Aryan families and communities have become Hinduised and admitted into the ranks of the \'twice born.\'" \n"These ascensions in the social scale have usually been gradual and almost imperceptible, but in some cases they are the result of a revolt against the arbitrary classification or of a self-assertion supported by material advantages" \n"Thus in Southern India the goldsmiths resisted the rule of the Brahmans and claimed to be the true spiritual leaders. In general, however, caste and occupation are inseparable and unchangeable." \n"Each caste is at once a religious brotherhood and a trade guild. Int he latter capacity it supervises the training of its younger members, regulates wages, maintains boards of arbitration and fosters good fellowship by social gatherings"\n\n"The famous fabrics of India owe their peculiar excellence of workmanship to these conditions. We see in them the results of skill inherited from generations of workers along the same lines, directed and controlled by the guild" \n"The same factors are also responsible for the lack of originality displayed in Indian art productions. The artisan of today is educated to the same standard and methods, and adopts even the same designs, that have been handed down in his caste-trade through the centuries" \n"When we consider that one caste may have no intimate relations with another, that the shadow of one man falling across the food of another,as it lies upon the ground, may necessitate his throwing it to the dogs..."\n\n"and that a Hindu can no more change his caste than he can his skin, it is difficult to perceive how anything like self-government can be possible to such a people." \n"Nor is the present agitation for universal, or extensive, representation based on a desire for the betterment of the lower classes." \n"With few exceptions, the educated Hindus who form the ranks of the agitators are either blinded by lack of understanding or actuated by selfish motives. It is not in the nature of things that they should have either sympathy for the low caste peasant or regard for his welfare" \n"Since the days of Asoka Hindustan has prospered only under the rule of foreigners, and so it must be until caste is abolished and the spirit of brotherhood made possible, a condition that cannot come about short of a century." \n"With these people a difference of religion is not, as with us, a matter of no political or social consequence, but one which constitutes an impassable barrier in every respect."\n\n"Then there are some 60,000,000 Mohammedans, who entertain the utmost contempt and hatred for Hindus in general" \n"What would be the character of a legislative assembly based upon the representation of such a population? It could not fail to be dominated by prejudice, or rather by conflicting prejudices. Anything like a national spirit could not possibly prevail among its members" \n"Its enactments would necessarily be in the nature of class legislation and would result in an increase of the present antagonism between classes. The proposition advanced by the extremists that the British should be forced from the country, is hardly worth of consideration" \n"In the first place, it would not be possible of accomplishment. AN uprising today would have far less prospects of success--even though supported by the native army, which shows no signs of disaffection-- than had that of 1857" \n"The Indian princes, the propertyowners and the monied men would all oppose revolution and without their aid such a movement would be worse than hopeless. But even if the Hindus could and should oust the British what would they gain?" \n"In a very short time their conflicting elements would be engaged in strife as of old and confronted by an internal enemy.The Mohammedans,who are united by the strongest ties, and who are forceful as the majority of Hindus are weak, would sweet the country with little difficulty" \n"and we should see the Nizam of Hyderabad, or some other follower of Islam, upon the throne of India"'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'qpc0kp'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qpc0kp/since_caste_equating_hinduism_with_casteism_is/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'AR Rahman and Mani Ratnam on their 25-year-old collaboration | 2017'<br />Body: 'Twenty-five  years, 15 film albums, innumerable chartbusters... **Mani Ratnam** and **AR  Rahman** are arguably the greatest director-composer duo of our time. Ahead of the release of their latest offering, *Kaatru Veliyidai*, The celebrated duo takes a walk down memory lane with *Chennai Times*, talking about everything‚Ä¶ from the moment when Mani Ratnam heard  Rahman‚Äôs music for the first time to how their composing sessions are  today. \n\n**What was the first thing that struck you when you listened to Rahman‚Äôs music, way back in 1992?**\n\n**Mani Ratnam (MR):** When you listen to music, you listen to music. You like it very much or not. For me, his music was just amazing. It took me out from where I was sitting and transported me to a different world.\n\n**AR Rahman (AR):** Not everyone gets a Mani Ratnam movie for their first film. So, imagine how cool it must have been for me!\n\n**MR:** And not everyone gets AR Rahman‚Äôs first film, too! (laughs)\n\n**Did you feel any pressure at that time?**\n\n**AR:** I had a lot of pressure. He was very kind, but outside, they were all looking at me like, ‚ÄòWhat! You, composing for a Mani Ratnam film? What are you gonna do?‚Äô I wouldn‚Äôt play the songs to everyone, but some people would come and listen. There was this gentleman who supplied music equipment. He had helped me get all my equipment. So, he came and listened, and he was silent. After a while, he asked, ‚ÄòWhat have you done? This is a disaster. Where‚Äôs the tabla? Where‚Äôs the violin? They are what make a song. Not this stuff.‚Äô I was really concerned and told Mani Ratnam ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to add tabla and violin‚Äô, and he told me, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do anything. This is perfect.‚Äô\n\n**As a director, were you, at any point of time, concerned if the audience would get what Rahman was doing with** ***Roja*****? Was there any worry that the music could be ahead of its time?**\n\n**MR:** No. I looked at it as a director. And a director is a very selfish person. His first priority is his film. The film was called *Roja*, it was set in Kashmir and the music that he played had the feel of that winter - that cold of that place. So, I was not worried if somebody would get it. I was getting it. Also, I thought it was absolutely fantastic and it was just going to lift my visuals.\n\n**AR:** I remember he came to my mother and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing a movie with your son now. If this doesn‚Äôt work out, I‚Äôll do another movie with him.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt really have to say that.\n\n**After** ***Roja*****, which changed the soundscape of our movies, came** ***Thiruda Thiruda*****, which, again, had a totally new sound, again. How much did the success of** ***Roja*** **weigh on you then?**\n\n**AR:** I think *Roja*‚Äôs success made us work really, really hard. We were kind of masochists, and we were destroying ourselves. Vairamuthu sir, in fact, said, ‚ÄòAnybody else would have died living up to what we did with *Roja*‚Äô. We were pushing ourselves and I think that‚Äôs why it still stands the test of time.\n\n**MR:** It was an experimental album, but we didn‚Äôt think of it that way then. Still, Rahman was trying everything. The film was a wild film, so he could go that expansive in the music. It was just the chance for us to open up a lot more.\n\n**How do you arrive at the tone to a soundtrack? For instance, with** ***Iruvar*****, you chose to evoke the period of the film rather than provide the music of that era‚Ä¶**\n\n**AR:** I think it comes naturally from the script - the setting, the characters. So, that itself decides this. But of course, he has his unique vision, so he picks the right tune. This way, half my job is done. I‚Äôm a big fan of MGR and that era of music. So, I went into that zone a bit for *Iruvar*.\n\n**MR:** We tried to do one kind of song for each of the decades in that film. What I felt was that the music should give a feel of that period and should not have only the same instruments or same voices or the same recording that were used then. It should evoke that period, but I should still be able to listen to it today. It should connect to me. The album was an interpretation of what people heard in those eras.\n\n**AR:** *Narumugaiye* did that. It had some instruments that were not of that period.\n\n**Do you choose tunes that would work well in both the languages? Most of the songs in your collaboration sound equally good in both Hindi and Tamil.**\n\n**AR:** It is one of the most torturous things. He was already a celebrated director and had a fan following while we were doing *Roja*. I was new. We didn‚Äôt even know that the music was going to work in Hindi, but it was so big in Hindi as well. So, the next movie, *Bombay* was such a challenge. This is one of the reasons why we settle for phonetics‚Ä¶ *Humma Humma* or *Chaiyya Chaiyya*, they are all phonetics in a way, and so we can get away with not being region-specific. It was a formal challenge.\n\n**When you have Rahman as a composer, people expect songs. So, are songs a compromise? How integral are they to your films?**\n\n**MR:** I like songs. It‚Äôs a weakness that I have. A song is a burden that you carry happily. When you have a song, it is like a mini-film within a film. It has a wholesomeness within itself. And sometimes, the song is so good that it stands out more than the film. You know that it is bigger than the film, but still you are greedy and try to fit it in as much as you can. It‚Äôs your love for it that matters.\n\n**AR:** That‚Äôs true. If you don‚Äôt get a great song, your belief in the song is gone, and you try to cut it down. Unless you or the director believes in it, a song is not going to work. If he doesn‚Äôt completely like a song, he is not going to picturise it very well.\n\n**Given that every album has been critically acclaimed and a chartbuster, do the expectations weigh on you when you sit down together to compose for a new film?**\n\n**MR:** For me, every film a new film; for him, it‚Äôs a fresh one. I struggle, but he is a master.\n\n**AR:** Actually, after a while, we didn‚Äôt even realise the pressure at all. It was like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre just doing a movie‚Äô. The pressure is from people who keep asking you questions like, ‚ÄòWhat are you going to do this time with Mani Ratnam?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going to happen?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWho are all going to be in it?‚Äô and so on. Even when we do a film in Hindi, there‚Äôs this pressure. But that‚Äôs good. When people expect something, you think, ‚ÄòOh my god! This is so important‚Äô, and you also raise your level.\n\n**How do you zone this pressure out?**\n\n**MR:** We don‚Äôt. We keep it mind, but it remains at the subconscious level. You know that when you watch films or listen to the music, you expect certain things. That‚Äôs how people are. So, use it your advantage. Whatever you have done, you have done your best. And do what is right. Luckily for us, in our work, we have the next story, which kind of dictates the requirements. So, within that, we try to do what we can do best - what is right for it. Still, you are aware of what people expect at a subconscious level in your mind. And you think of ways to go beyond that.\n\n**Where does the journey of a Mani Ratnam-AR Rahman album start?**\n\n**AR:** Anywhere. Sometimes, he doesn‚Äôt even tell me the story.\n\n**MR:** Yes, these days, I don‚Äôt.\n\n**AR:** He will ask me to play the tunes and say, ‚ÄòI like this tune, this one, and this one‚Äô and pick them up.\n\n**So, do you generally have pre-composed tunes ready?**\n\n**AR:** Not exactly. I have a melody element that reflects feelings‚Ä¶ like love, passion and so on. I keep sending him ideas whenever I get them and ask him to check them out.\n\n**Is there any song in** ***Kaatru Veliyidai*** **that happened this way‚Ä¶ where he did not narrate the situation but just picked up the tune?**\n\n**AR:** *Nallai Illai* and *Vaan Varuvaan* were chosen like that.\n\n**How do you decide that a particular tune will be liked by Mani Ratnam?**\n\n**AR:** It‚Äôs not about him liking a tune. When I compose something, I have to like it first. I have to be proud of it and feel, ‚ÄòAh, this is beautiful‚Äô or ‚ÄòThis chord progression is nice‚Äô‚Ä¶ If it emotionally moves me, then I‚Äôm sure that he will like it as well. Sometimes, he might not like it, too. For instance, my favourite was *Nenjukkulle (Kadal)* while his favourite was *Moongil Thottam*. Both the tunes had the same tempo and were on accordion. And the lyrics for both were extraordinary. Finally, we ended up using both.\n\n**Is there any difference between how your composing sessions were earlier and how they are at present?**\n\n**AR:** I think we used to hang out more. I miss going to Maldives or to Bangalore for such sessions.\n\n**MR:** Today, Rahman travels all over the world, but that doesn‚Äôt stop us. He still sends me tunes whether he is here or abroad through Skype.\n\n**How comfortable is it to discuss tunes over Skype?**\n\n**MR:** I think music has a way of crossing everything.\n\n**AR:** Yes, music is all about conveying something. But for background scores, we need to be face-to-face, as the momentum is much better then. For lyrics, again, we have to sit together and discuss, which is what is beautiful about the process.\n\n**How is a typical session like when you three get together?**\n\n**AR:** We will show it to you on Periscope once (laughs). Actually, it is both fun and stressful.\n\n**Does the discussion stay predominantly about the song or do you discuss other stuff as well?**\n\n**AR:** With him, you know how it is‚Ä¶ When he is doing a movie, and if you talk something other than the subject, he‚Äôll just say, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care what you are talking about. Is it related to my movie?‚Äô So, I wander around, but he is very focused.\n\n**MR:** I think that‚Äôs good to wander once in a while because Rahman gets some random ideas and they work very well. When the three of us sit together, you can really feel the synergy.\n\n**What‚Äôs the most crucial thing needed in a director-composer relationship?**\n\n**MR:** The two of you should want to reach for something higher. It is not about settling for the first thing that comes but finding what will be apt for a situation. I‚Äôm not saying that every song has to be an all-time hit or the greatest ever music. That‚Äôs not what you should set out to do. But you have to find out what will work best for a particular story or theme or backdrop, and discuss how not to make it a clich√© or fall into such traps. That‚Äôs how we have make ourselves reinvent. Rahman does it all the time by taking a drastically different route, so it brings in freshness.\n\n**Is there any combo that you both are fans of?**\n\n**MR and AR:** There have always been such directors and composers from all over the world. KV Mahadevan and K Viswanath, that‚Äôs one combination. MSV-Balachander‚Ä¶ Bharathirajaa-Ilaiyaraaja is a fantastic combination‚Ä¶ Mahendran-Ilaiyaraaja, and even what Gulzar did with RD Burman.\n\n**Do you think of being part of such a director-composer list while composing?**\n\n**MR:** You have your movie to make. Why do you have to unnecessarily fight with them? That‚Äôs all the music that you have enjoyed, that you have grown up with‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all inside you. Don‚Äôt think about it and just do the best you can.\n\n**AR:** Yes, the respect is already there inside you.\n\n**What‚Äôs the difference that you feel in composing for a Mani Ratnam film vis-√†-vis another director‚Äôs film?**\n\n**AR:** I think it‚Äôs his aura. It forces you to push yourself. Suppose I‚Äôm in a room with four great musicians and I sit with my headphones to compose‚Ä¶ My whole attitude will be like ‚ÄòOh, they are watching me‚Äô. I feel the aura of them looking at me, their musicality‚Ä¶ Even in a concert, we play better when we have an audience who are greatly educated in music. You start doing different things. The same way, when you are working with a director like Mani Ratnam who has such a legacy, you come up with some great ideas just to get his appreciation.\n\n**How do you handle any disagreement that might crop up in this relationship?**\n\n**MR:** By talking about it. It‚Äôs just that Rahman knows that it‚Äôs not about him and when I say something is not nice, he understands that what I‚Äôm talking about is that something will not work for the situation that I have in the film.\n\n**AR:** He has been working only with me for 25 years. And I have been working with other people. So, if he doesn‚Äôt feel satisfied, it only means that I did not make him happy.\n\n[Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/photo-features/ar-rahman-and-mani-ratnam-on-their-25-year-old-collaboration/photostory/57961027.cms)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'qp6g2u'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qp6g2u/ar_rahman_and_mani_ratnam_on_their_25yearold/</li>

I  hadn‚Äôt  noticed  until  then  that  Babaji  had  consumed  so  much mutton that the bones heaped on his plate (of banana or sal leaves) looked like the residue of some Taimur-like invader‚Äôs killings! I was genuinely upset. ‚ÄòBabaji,‚Äô I  told  him,  ‚Äòshame  on  you!  You  have  disgraced  the  name  of  Hari  and  have debased the locket you wear to identify yourself as a Vaishnava. \ue004e others in the community will now refuse to share a meal with you!‚Äô\n\nBabaji: Only because I have eaten meat? Where has God asked us not to eat mutton? In fact, the Padma Purana particularly instructs that Vishnu should be offered meat during his worship. Krishna was born a Kshatriya and like other Kshatriyas had eaten meat in his lifetime.\n\nMyself: Isn‚Äôt non-violence the greatest religion of all?\n\nBabaji:  Yes,  it  is.  But  the  real  significance  of  non-violence  is  not  as  the Buddhists interpret it. Non-violence originally meant not to be jealous of others and to respect all human beings. Whoever can do that is a Vaishnava, no matter what religion he belongs to. He can even be a Christian or a Muslim. And those of you who perform useless rituals without understanding the true meaning of your faith do not deserve to be called Vaishnavas.\n\nMyself: You mean, I am allowed to eat meat and fish?\n\nBabaji: Of course you are.\n\nSo I requested a plate and joined in the feast. I took a small portion of rice and mutton curry at first but the delicious food enhanced my appetite, tempting me to  have  more  and  more.  Eyeing  the  large  quantity  of  mutton  I  ate,  Babaji  was concerned about my health and commented, ‚ÄòNext year, I will request Kashim Sheikh to cook for Durga Puja. He can prepare chicken for us ‚Äì which would be lighter on our digestive systems.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI personally believe our ancestors consumed meat and animal sacrifices were an essential part of many of our rituals.

After meeting twice face facing me &amp; my mama mate this girl and her family informal meeting she is preparing for her m pharm.\n\nShe was introduced through a relative of ours.\n\nThis is the first time I had some sort of connection with the girl(searching groom for 8 months now) I thought I liked her even given our almost 4 years age difference.\n\nMy Parents and mama didn't like the girl, They think I will get a better girl and I deserve a better-looking life partner but they as well told me it will be my Call to make. On the same note, my dad told me the girl wouldn't look good when I will go with her for social outings like family and friends functions.\n\nMy parents have seen her pictures only never seen her personally.\n\nThis was a shocker to me I thought about it for the whole night and eventually said no last Sunday as a final call to the girl's family(obviously it was influenced by my parents).

      <li>Title::: 'Ok, honest question! Why is our country getting too polarized, along with the rest of the world? (not really a question, just somewhere I can r/offmychest myself)'<br />Body: 'We are either Modi-bh\\*\\*\\*s or liber\\*\\*dus. Either anti-national or Nazis except brown. Was it always this way? Also, I am truly not being biased here but why is it so hard to understand that our country is doing better under Modi\'s leadership while also acknowledging his faults?\n\nAnd why do we hate or love a religion without reading its holy book? And why don\'t we understand that certain rituals/habits need to be improved in all religions and that every religion has something positive to give?\n\nI\'ll give an example. My parents were the typical Hindu parents. Sanskar Sanskar. Sanskar. Males being the best thing since Aloo bhujia-rice. Arranged marriage. So many poojas. No freedom. Did I say Sanskar?\n\nAnd I hated my religion because of it. Religion is tied to country. So hated this country. Country is tied to culture so hated this culture.\n\nSo I welcomed the western culture with open arms. Why not? There was freedom! I was opposing my parents through my clearly "superior intellect". They were backward. I was embarrassed of them. And of course, anything they cautioned me as bad was clearly good.\n\nBut on the way, I pretended to be someone I am not. This happens when you reject your roots. I wished I was never born in this country, that I was white and in Europe or whatever.\n\nAnd my sister, also my fellow hater of everything Hindu had a thought. Lets read our holy books (Gita, Vedas, etc) and then hate it even more.\n\nInstead, we were in love with the beauty of this culture. Our hate turned to love on the way, probably due to something called logic. And surprise of surprises, we discovered that hinduism didn\'t actually oppress women (see, early Vedic civilization or read the Geeta), that we didn\'t actually suppress reasoning, we instead nurtured it.\n\nMy point. If you hate a religion/idealogy, understand it and you won\'t hate it anymore. Wisdom and compassion go hand in hand. One without the other is poison.\n\nI don\'t know much about Islam but I am sure the same applies there too. Every religion is good if we question it and use logic. If there is something wrong, we understand that those times were different and we change it.\n\nOur country and this world really really needs compassion. Whatever ideology disturbs us, we need to study it. Understand their circumstance.\n\nFor example, I was "anti-national" because my parents didn\'t have the right knowledge. They didn‚Äôt have the right knowledge because they were more focused on making money to survive rather than questioning their parents\' views and on matters of ideology. And this goes on and on. Compassion is the only thing that can break this cycle. And now, I am proud of my parents, of their qualities, their sacrifices. Because, however they were, they gave their best and I really appreciate that.\n\nEvery religion on the planet advocates kindness, advocates that as humans, our purpose is to develop qualities, become better people.\n\nI hope that someday people will go deeper and be more understanding of each other. They are not, because they don\'t have the right knowledge, one day, they will :-)'<br />Author: 'Satyam7166'  id: 'qorqby'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qorqby/ok_honest_question_why_is_our_country_getting_too/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Professor who claimed in Print that Hindus need to support namaz in temples and public places is professor at New Delhi‚Äôs Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, funded by GOI.'<br />Body: '&gt;As a practicing Muslim, my Namaz has always been a reflection of my commitment to spirituality. My colleagues, friends, teachers, and students have always been encouraging. No one has ever found it anti-Hindu or anti-India. Even unknown people, mostly Hindus, pay respect to my Namaz. This was so heartening that I was able to offer Namaz in moving trains, on busy streets, in the corridors of hospitals, and even inside the functional Hindu temples.\n\nIt is important to note that the Namaz (Salat in Arabic) is one of the five pillars of Islam (the other four are Shahad, Saum/Roza, Zakat, and Hajj). Yet, it has become the most important performative religious activity.\n\nThe rise of Tablighi Jamaat in India as the most powerful Sunni religious reform movement in recent years also contributed significantly to this process. There is a strong belief among Sunni Muslim communities that Namaz is the only criterion to evaluate a person‚Äôs moral-religious character as a Muslim.\n\n\nhttps://theprint.in/opinion/namaz-isnt-an-anti-hindu-act-time-for-every-indian-to-defend-islam/758407/\n\nIn new article in Financial Times, he states:\n\n&gt;‚ÄúThe Hindu-Muslim divide is so deep in the public sphere,‚Äù said Hilal Ahmed, a professor at New Delhi‚Äôs Centre for the Study of Developing Societies. ‚ÄúIf India wins, the credit will go to Hindu players.

      <li>Title::: "Twitter is censoring OpIndia. I think it's high time right-wing outlets start a parallel presence on censorship-resistant platforms like LBRY/Odysee, and Rumble"<br />Body: '[OpIndia is getting censored] (https://www.opindia.com/2021/11/twitter-censors-opindia-elle-cartoon-diwali/) \n\n[Discussion on r/Indiaspeaks] (https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qmzyxb/twitter_censors_opindia_cartoon_how_big_tech/)\n\nI feel strongly that OpIndia and other Indian companies must migrate to censorship-resistant platforms and take their audience there. Big Tech controls the narrative and the day is not far when they label OpIndia and Swarajya (the latter has a YouTube channel) as \'Islamophobic misinformation\' and boot them off the internet. There is new legislation discussed in the US which will make a person/entity, once banned, unable to make an account anywhere. So if you get banned from YouTube or Twitter you are effectively shadowbanned from the entire internet.\n\nSome of the older "anti-censorship" platforms are not good. Gab (Twitter alternative) is a place for racists and Nazis, the same, to some extent, goes for B i t-chute (YT alternative).\n\nTherefore, the best platforms for Indian RW companies to have a parallel presence on are: [LBRY] (https://odysee.com/@LBC:a3/LBC-Info_Channel_What_is_LBRY:b) / [Odysee] (https://odysee.com/@MundoVirtual:c/what-is-lbry-decentralized-platform-that:f) and Rumble. These platforms are more mainstream and a lot of YouTubers with lakhs of subscribers have synced their account to Odysee. Shecooks (Indian channel with 8 lakh subs), ADV China (4.3 lakhs), and Some Ordinary Gamers (gaming channel with 2 million subscribers, run by an Indian American) and many others are on Odysee. Being on Odysee is not only a way to get more subscribers but also a means to prevent Big Tech\'s hold on our access to information.\n\nLBRY is a protocol that operates on the blockchain. What this mean is, it runs like a torrent app. When Jeremy Kauffman uploads a video to his channel, others who watch the video download it to their computer if they are using the LBRY desktop app. They then seed (upload) the file to other users that want to watch the video/image/document/text post using their own bandwidth. Censorship is therefore prevented. You can turn seeding on and off whenever you like. It is also possible to donate LBC (a cryptocurrency) coins or even regular cash donations to these channels and support them.\n\nRumble is based in Canada and has a lot of channels with a focus on politics, viral videos, and news. Reuters, Discovery, and many channels (Dinesh D\'Souza and WION for example) are on Rumble. It is also a good option despite its poor interface.\n\nThe far-left that controls Big Tech is very intolerant and powerful. They think they have a duty to protect us from harmful thoughts since we are children who should be taught what to think. I therefore appeal to RW (and even LW) outlets to start a parallel presence on Rumble and Odysee, and defeat these people who accuse everybody that doesn\'t follow their narrative of being fascists.\n\nLinks:\n\n[LBRY] (https://lbry.com/)\n\n[Odysee] (https://odysee.com/)'<br />Author: 'Educational_Repair37'  id: 'qoixo2'<br />Score:170<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qoixo2/twitter_is_censoring_opindia_i_think_its_high/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Quite a lot of Economists and opinion writers think that India's under-performance (compared with China and other East Asian countries) has to with over spending on her religious activities."<br />Body: 'Recently I went through a book [In Spite of Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74121.In_Spite_of_the_Gods). In which the author tries to draw similar lines  and he is wrong.\n\nThere are a lot of other reasons that are hampering India\'s growth (Gandhi-Nehru Economics, Bureaucracy, Lack of political will).\n\n1. **Urbanisation**: China and other Asian countries are heavily urbanised (if not they are small enough). Cities are not virtuous as villages and it comes with a horde of issues but Cities are the engines of Economic growth. Businesses in cities can be easily regulated, formalised. Contrary to this India went with "Rural Development" (Gandhian philosophy), the result is farmers have a huge say in politics but least to do with Economy.\n2. **Protectionism**: Nehru and common Indian\'s were scared of letting foreign companies in India given the Colonial History. If you do a comparative study Singapore was not scared of it (they even officially anglicised Singapura to Singapore), China (CCP) was wary of it but they let foreign companies with 50% local partnership to set up factories.\n3. **Socialism**: I don\'t want to blame Nehru again but the point is Nehru or Gandhi were not Economists, they should have taken advice from eligible people. The problem is not that we learned Socialism failed, we learnt it very late and showed no interest in correcting it. China started with Maoism (far worse than Nehru\'s Socialism) but later CCP leaders corrected it and brought it to what it is today. We were forced to Liberalise our economy.\n4. **Liberalisation (Half done job):** There are still a lot of Indian Industries that are controlled by the Government. Liberalisation efforts were stopped the moment GDP growth rate was decent enough.\n5. **Bureaucracy**: Perhaps no other country suffers from this more than India, we have people running India who are still taught a curriculum designed by Britishers to efficiently manage Colonel India. You can read about the government\'s fight with the IAS lobby just to privatise Air India.\n6. **Lack of R&amp;D**: We can improve things only when we try to understand with an open mind and come up with metrics to measure it. Recent example is Global Hunger Index, BJP was fast enough to cry about telephonic Gallup etc, Congress might have done the same with media support. The point is It is some foreign agency which is giving the ratings, NFHS (India\'s comprehensive survey conducted every 4 years with help from US Aid) shows decline in a lot of parameters considered by GHI &amp; 2020 data is not published hence GHI had to use old data. There are so many key Indicators that India should develop, standardise and work on achieving its target.\n\nPS:\n\n*Sorry if this post reads like a rant. I\'m very optimistic that things will change, current government even with lack of knowledgeable people in their side, amateurish behaviour they still have the best intentions for the country.*\n\n*I saw a post couple of minutes back asking the same question but was deleted before I could post my reply, thought sharing it anyways.

      <li>Title::: 'Ravana is supposed to be a Brahmin, many Brahmins from Mathura to Gujarat claim to be his lineage. How did Ravana become a symbol for "anti-brahminism"?'<br />Body: 'Ravana\'s father was Visvavasu Brahma who was a Brahmin. Ravana himself is considered great scholar of the Vedas, a devotee of Shiva, a composer of many Shaivite hymns and astrological texts\n\n&gt;Ravana was born to a great sage Vishrava (or Vesamuni), and his wife, the daitya princess Kaikesi- . He was born in the Devagana, as his grandfather, the sage Pulastya, was one of the ten Prajapatis or mind-born sons of Brahma and one of the Saptarishi (Seven Great Sages Rishi) in the first Manvantara. Kaikesi\'s father, Sumali (or Sumalaya), king of the Daityas, wished her to marry the most powerful being in the mortal world, so as to produce an exceptional heir. He rejected the kings of the world, as they were less powerful than him. Kaikesi searched among the sages and finally chose Vishrava, the father of Kubera. Ravana was a Daitya or Rakshasa and he belonged to the caste of Brahmins. Ravana later usurped Lanka from his half brother Kubera and became the King of Lanka and became a Kshatriya thereon.\n\n&gt;**Rama had once addressed Ravana as a "Maha Brahman" (Great Brahmam in the context of his education).**\n\n&gt;Father Vishrava noted that while Ravana was aggressive and arrogant, he was also an exemplary scholar. Under Vishrava\'s tutelage, Ravana mastered the Vedas, the holy books, and also the arts and ways of Kshatriyas (warriors). Ravana was also an excellent veena player and the sign of his flag had a picture of veena on it. \n\nhttps://archive.md/81lXD\n\n**The Kanyakubja Brahmins of Vidisha district worship Ravana; they personify him as a symbol of prosperity and regard him as a saviour, claiming that Ravana was also a Kanyakubja Brahmin. Thousands of Kanyakubja Brahmins of the village Ravangram of Netaran, in the Vidisha District of Madhya Pradesh, perform daily puja (worship) in the Ravan temple and offer naivedyam / bhog (a ritual of sacrifice to the Gods). Centuries ago King Shiv Shankar built a Ravana temple at Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The Ravana temple is opened once a year, on Dashehra Day, to perform puja for the welfare of Ravana.[31]**\n\n**The Sachora Brahmins of Gujarat also claim to descend from Ravana, and sometimes have "Ravan" as their surnames.[33]**\n\n**Some Saraswat Brahmins from Mathura claim Ravana as a saraswat brahmin as per his lineage.[34][35]**\n\nThere is also reference to "Ravani", the lineage of Upadhyaya Yasastrata II, who was of the Gautama gotra and was a son of Acharya Vasudatta, and described as "born of Ravani".[36]\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana\n\nhttps://www.hinduamerican.org/blog/the-symbolism-of-ravanas-10-heads'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'qnxlch'<br />Score:68<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qnxlch/ravana_is_supposed_to_be_a_brahmin_many_brahmins/</li>

But that is my personal experience. My observation and bias. I know around 5-6 people falsely accused of rape. 3 spent some time in jail. 2-3 avoided jail time when the matter was solved at the police station. Don\'t know any woman raped.\n\nNow 77% rate is the actual acquittal rape in India(according to NCRB stats). Rest 23% is conviction. Now there is a catch here. Out of these 23% majority is a special category of rapes(which I prefer to call as *Imaginary*) and that is *Rape on the pretext of marriage*. Keeping legal thinking in mind, *Rape on the pretext of marriage* is BS. An adult woman knows the consequences of having sex with a man out of wedlock. It\'s like woman from the fav sitcom **"How I met your mother"** accusing **Barney** of rape because he lies to get laid. And yes if Barney would have been in India, he would have **hanged till death** for this imaginary rape.\n\nThere are violent rapes and it happens. Like Dec 2012 rape case or Hyderabad rape case. But these are rare and gets highlighted.\n\nWhile stalking, molestation and groping is more prevalent. Almost all the girls I know have faced such harassment at-least once in their life.\n\nAnd if you have doubt on anything I say, you can attend any court in any corner of the country. Sit through the hearing of rape cases and know the reality yourself.

      <li>Title::: 'Ellenabad bypolls of Haryana and why the results are a setback for anti farm law protestors.'<br />Body: "The strategy of the anti farm laws protestors is clear: oppose BJP and make them lose everywhere until they can successfully arm-twist BJP into accepting their demands and go back on the farm laws. There have been 11 rounds of dialogue with them and if there is no agreement after all this, it's pretty clear BJP will take the hit and slug it out.\n\nEllenabad is a stronghold of the INLD and the Chautalas. It's been so since the times of OP Chautala (for more than 20 years now). Abhay Chautala, his song, resigned from the Haryana Vidhan Sabha after the 26 January incident in support of the protests. Keep in mind that he was the only elected INLD MLA. This gave BJP an opportunity. Last time, they fielded Pawan Beniwal, who is also from majority Jat community, but he came second, losing by more than 10K votes. He resigned from BJP in support of farm laws n contested from Congress this time. Bharat Beniwal, who was on Congress ticket last time, felt betrayed. There r even insiders who say he cross voted fr BJP. \n\nThis time also BJP Haryana unit was considering putting a Jat face like Captain Abhimanyu Sindhu (ex Haryana finance minister who is also on West UP duty, trying to win back Jats there) or Nitasha Sihag (Jat face, BJP Haryana Mahila Morcha, strong ground worker). This is seat is a difficult one because it is majority Jat plus has good number of Sikhs. Jats r mostly against BJP in Haryana for various reasons, but they dont hate BJP as much as rural Sikhs. Either way, contest was in favour of INLD completely. BJP was having a tough time finding a candidate willing to contest bcs all odds were initially against BJP.\n\nThe powerful Kanda family, esp. Gopal Kanda, HVP MLA of Sirsa lobbied through Sunita Duggal (BJP MP of Sirsa) to put forward his brother Gobind Kanda. They are baniyas by caste who r a small minority bt they hv a lot of money n influence in Sirsa. Gopal Kanda was even in d Hooda-led Congress cabinet in Haryana, so they r no small players. Of course, he also tainted bcs of d Geetika Sharma case. \n\nNow, it is an open secret that most of these protestors who tried to derail BJP's campaign were frm INLD. There r various newspaper clipings indicating d same. This is why BJP didnt send any big players lk Khattar until d vry last day. EC also kept borders closed so no one could violate election norms. \n\nYes, BJP did not win d seat, bt the gap has narrowed to less than 7K votes in a seat which they wud hv otherwise no chance w/ a non Jat candidate. Now, Tikait and co. wud lk u to believe that their role was d main reason fr BJP's loss. If that were d case, BJP wud hv come third, or lost by a much bigger margin. During counting, there was a point when margin was less than 3K.\n\nFirst, this sends d message that farm protests don't represent d common sentiment in Haryana. All d noise is frm a vocal minority. Even Jats didnt go out of their way to defeat BJP unless they were dedicated political workers. There r reports that up to 20% of Jats voted fr BJP in this seat (nt bad fr a 3 way contest n considering d situation in d state after 2016). \n\nSecond, leaving BJP turned out to be horrible blunder fr Pawan Beniwal who failed to even save his deposit. Infighting btwn Kumari Selja n Bhupinder Hooda in addition to anger in Bharat Beniwal against Pawan Beniwal made sure 2/3 of Congress' base went to BJP, another 1/3 to INLD. \n\nThird, JJP's (Dushyant Chautala's party) whatever little base was there before in Ellenabad was at least 80% in tact even if their main votebank is seething over their support to BJP and farm laws. This contributed 6-7K votes to BJP. Digvijay Chautala is a wonderful orator n d stuff he says abt how Jats were cheated in d reservation protests n again r being cheater w/ farm laws protest is on point. I really think BJP shud take him on loan frm JJP fr some time. Great youth leader. I say this even w/ my dislike fr d Chautalas. \n\nFourth, keep in mind BJP is in a coalition gov't w/ JJP. Which means JJP has to be strong fr them to continue. If JJP cadres mass-defect to INLD, it makes d situation all d worse fr d current gov't.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NewsArenaIndia/status/1455470961319284738\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NewsArenaIndia/status/1455823167432183810\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NewsArenaIndia/status/1455780879477870594\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NewsArenaIndia/status/1455620408317595650"<br />Author: 'TallChef__'  id: 'qmr15h'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qmr15h/ellenabad_bypolls_of_haryana_and_why_the_results/</li>

They improvised it &amp; made innovations.\n\nHowever, the initial knowledge of Gunpowder came to China from India.\n\nEven Scholar Roger Pauly, a hardcore Sinophile, admits "Indian inspiration"\nImage\nFor those familiar with Indian literature, this should hardly come as a surprise. Indian literature contains ample references to what could be seen as an early form of Gunpowder\n\nLet us examine these references before jumping into the discussion about Dipavali \nVaisampayana, the narrator of Mahabharata, describes the manufacture of smoke balls by ancient Indians using what many scholars see as Gunpowder.\n\nAccording to a medieval commentator of the verse, the aforementioned smoke balls were indeed made of Gunpowder.\nImage\nAtharvanarahasya mentions the use of charcoal, sulphur and saltpetre to make gunpowder, which are the same ingredients used even today to manufacture Gunpowder.\n\nIn-fact, workers at Sivakasi use these ingredients to make fireworks even today (more below)\nImage\nA look at how Diwali fireworks are manufactured by traditional makers to this day is very revealing.\n\nThis video shows traditional maker of fireworks from Andhra in action.\n\nThis is a simple form of crackers but use of such crackers is very widespread\n\nLion and fire\n116 subscribers\nHow To Make Diwali Crackers\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nIn the above video, the Andhra maker uses basic ingredients to make simple fireworks.\n\n1. Suryakara (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞, Telugu ‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞∞‡±á‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞∞‡∞Æ‡±Å)= Saltpetre\n\n2. Gandhaka(‡§ó‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§ï, ‡∞ó‡∞Ç‡∞ß‡∞ï‡∞Æ‡±Å)= Sulphur.\n\n3. Sand.\n\nThese were known in India since ancient age . Why would Indians borrow this from anywhere? \nThe etymology of the ingredients tells us about their. origin\n\nThe Indian firecracker workers of Andhra and Sivakasi use the Indic Saltpetre (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞) whose origin is Sanskritic. They do not use the word Shora (‡§∂‡•ã‡§∞‡§æ ÿ¥Ÿàÿ±€Å) which is Persian for Saltpetre imported in medieval age \nIt takes an extremely colonized mindset to claim that Indians were incapable of making simple fireworks themselves when they had all basic ingredients since antiquity.\n\nDid they have to wait for Muslims to come and teach them to put all these ingredients in a container? \nUptil this point, we have seen that Indians had knowledge about use of Saltpetre/gunpowder &amp; were perfectly capable of making fireworks themselves.\n\nNow we shall come to Diwali.\n\nWhy are fireworks used in Diwali? What is the underlying theology?\n\nThese will be discussed further \nAt the core of Dipavali is a belief that our departed ancestors would come back on this night.\n\nIt is believed that on the night of Chaturdashi &amp; Amavasya, the Pitrs would come back.\n\nIt is the light &amp; noise which shows them the path in the dark. Hence we illuminate our houses. \nThe Skanda PurƒÅ·πáa is largest of the 18 MahƒÅPurƒÅ·πáas.\nIt describes the rites to be performed on Dƒ´pƒÅvalƒ´ and it mentions this belief.\n\nThe Vai·π£·πáava-kha·πá·∏ça of Skanda PurƒÅ·πáa says\n\n‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ ‡§®‡§∞‡§æ‡§É ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§É ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•Ñ‡§£‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç‡•§\n‡§®‡§∞‡§ï‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§¶‡§æ ‡•§‡•§\nImage\nThe Skanda Purana says Diwali should be celebrated by holding Ulkas in our hands. This will show path to our ancestors.\n\nWhat are "Ulkas"? The meaning of this word has changed with time. GV Tagare translates it as "firebrands".\n\n[Firecrackers in their early form were firebrands]\nImage\nImage\nAnalysing such verses, professor of Sanskrit and historian Dr. GV Raghavan concludes that (an early form of) crackers have been a part of Dipavali celebrations since earliest times.\n\nHe says that their religious purpose was to illuminate &amp; resonate the path of departed pitrs.\nImage\nImage\nIn her thesis, Indologist Tracy Pintchman says that the core of Diwali festivity is illuminating the path of deceased ancestors with firecrackers and lights\nImage\nThis is also corroborated in Ananda Ramayana.\n\nAnanda Ramayana is an epic that has been traditionally been attributed to Valmiki.\n\nIt mentions that fireworks were burst during Lord Rama\'s homecoming.\n\nIt mentions crackers which burst and shine in the sky (gaganantarvirajitan)\nImage\nAs against this, it is objected that Ananda RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa is a work of 15th century.\n\nBut these dates have been assigned by same Indologists who assigned a date of 500-100 BC (post Buddha) for Valmiki RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa.\n\nClearly, this is at odds with tradition which puts both in Treta Yuga \nIn Hinduism,date doesn\'t determine validity.\n\nWhat does is acceptance of texts among Sampradayas . Ananda Ramayana easily qualifies such test and is accepted by most Sampradayas.\n\n"This practice isn\'t old enough,ban it" is Abrahamic.This isnt really how Hindu tradition operates \nSuch an idea could be seen in MedhƒÅtithi\'s 11th century commentary on Manusmriti 2.6.\n\nHe says that a practice (in our case bursting firecrackers), what is actually done with a view to invisible results, by persons learned in the Veda has the authority of Smriti.\nImage\nHard archaeological evidence for all festivals has been allusive in a tropical &amp; frequently (re)populated civilization like India.\n\nThese are wall murals(of a possibly later date) on 9th century Tyagaraja temple in Tamilnadu.\n\nThey depict festival celebrations with firecrackers\nImage\nImage\nImage\nImage\nBogar Sattakandam is a book attributed to Tamil Siddha Saint Bogar. He is traditional dated to 500 BC but some modern scholars have put him in 5-7th century CE.\n\nDipavali firecrackers are clearly described in this book.\nImage\nBogar describes the method of preparing the Saltpetre solution(Vediuppu Cheyanir) for all types of Sarakku Vaippu. Fireworks, gunpowder etc. are all described\n\nFrom Sattakandam 415 to 418\nImage\nHindu tradition &amp; Hindu civilizational memory has always remembered firecrackers as an integral part of Hindu tradition.\n\nThere are thousands of paintings made all over India which show Krishna celebrating Diwali by bursting firecrackers\n\nHere is one from Rajasthan school\nImage\nAn objection is raised that these paintings are late.The earliest available of these Krishna-fireworks series of paintings comes from 16th century.\n\nBut that is precisely the point. Hindu art &amp; tradition hasnt seen firecrackers as an alien custom that was absent in Krishna\'s era\nImage\nA painting of Krishna watching Dipavali fireworks. From Kishangarh(Rajasthan).\n\nWhat to make of this? Were our ancestors such idiots that they made thousands of paintings depicting Krishna celebrating fireworks which may not have existed during his time? Or was it something else?\nImage\nIs it possible they remembered these medieval fireworks as a successor of something which had ancient roots in India and in their memory had been integral part of Hindu culture?\n\nHindu civilizational memory DOES NOT see Dipavali firecrackers as alien import. Rather the opposite. \nAs another example of civilizational memory, the great Marathi Saint Eknath (16th cent CE) describes firecracker celebrations in the wedding of Rukmini and Krishna.\n\nHe describes Agniyantra, Havai, Sumanmala, Chichundari, Bhuinala etc.\n\nThey can be found even today in Deccan\nImage\nThe great Maharastrian saint &amp; Shivaji Maharaj\'s Guru, Samarth Ramdas also describes various kinds of fireworks burst by Lord Rama\'s army in his Ramayana.\n\nThese firecrackers include havaiya, nala, phula(phuljhari), ghosha etc\nImage\nImage\nLet us pause and ask ourselves.What do we make of this?\n\nIf we assume firecrackers were imported in Muslim age, the inevitable conclusion is that all great Hindu painters, poets &amp;scholars were collectively wrong &amp; deluding themselves when they mentioned fireworks in ancient India \nBut there is another,more plausible possibility which does not require denying every evidence.\n\nSkanda Purana says Diwali should be celebrated by holding Ulkas in our hands.\n\nThese ulkas were mostly likely firebrands which served two purposes.\n\n1) Made noise\n2) Illuminated sky \nDiwali celebration with firebrands was its earliest form and must date back to thousands of years.\n\nEven today, such Diwali firebrands can be found.\n\nTake Kaunriya Kathi of Odisha. It is a basic Diwali firebrand without gunpowder. But it illuminates and makes noise.\nImage\nImage\nSuch firebrands illuminated sky which could explain why some commentators described ‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ of Skanda Purana as ‡§¶‡•Ä‡§™.\n\nThis was older, original form. Traces of it can be found in some medieval paintings.\n\nThis painting from Mir Kalan school depicts what is close to older form\nImage\nAt one point(definitely before Muslim age), Saltpetre was incorporated into firebrands. While use of such crackers gradually became widespread, more conservative ones persisted with the older form of firebrands which explains why not many ancient texts describe this innovation \nCrackers used in Ancient India were different from today\'s modern crackers. Just like chairs used in ancient India were different from today\'s modern chairs. Does that mean Chairs are not a part of Indian history? Almost everything used today is different from its predecessors. \nIf one goes by this logic, one could as well conclude that Ancient India had NOTHING in our culture because everything today is different from its yesteryear\'s predecessors. What is relevant is that the concept existed. And the concept was quite simple. \nThe concept was to use a combustible substance on the night of Dipavali to make a lot of noise, illuminate the sky and show the path to our departed ancestors. This is mentioned in the Skanda Purana itself &amp; is true irrespective of whether or not Ulka means modern fire crackers. \nWhat does it all show? With advancement of technology, everything changes. But the basic concept of using combustibles to make noise and illuminate the sky on the day of Dipavali existed since ancient times. This was not a foreign import or medieval 16th century concept. \nIn Sanskrit the original meaning of UlkƒÅ (‡§â‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ) was a "meteor". If the ancient combustibles used in Dipavali were just lamps, they would not have been given this name.\n\nThey are called UlkƒÅs because of the similar visual appearance of crackers to meteors.\n\nThis is common sense. \nThere is NO MENTION of Christmas in the Bible.\n\nThere is NO MENTION of Bakrid in Quran.\n\nWhen are milords banning these festivals?'<br />Author: 'ChirpingSparrows'  id: 'qmhdrv'<br />Score:108<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qmhdrv/bharadwajspeaks_dipavali_firecrackers_in_this/</li>

I was in search of any cancer community in India which is for mental health support, but I didn't found any. There are many organisations for financial support, and as of communities like 'uncancer india', people do not seek out and contact it. Have any of you had experience with uncancer india?\n\nI think emotional support is a very essential for cancer treatment but in india, there are not any such peer groups where cancer survivors and patients can meet. Such groups are created by hospitals in other countries and they say that such groups are great support.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on it?\nI know there are many Indians on this sub, not that I wish but some people might even be cancer survivors or patients here or caregivers, \nplease fellows, can you tell me what were your experiences with treatments in indian hospitals? Did you get connected with people with same situation that you were in ( be it for asking how treatment works from anyone other than doctor or for just getting to talk someone who can understand)??\n\n[P.s. hey all, I'm asking this because from many cancer survivors experiences, I am concluding that mental health support is not much prioritised in india. It often turns into toxic positivity from relatives and people who have not gone through cancer are not able to understand. It saddens me to see that only in tata memorial, mumbai nearly 17000 get diagnosed every year yet there is no such system.\nSuch peer groups system should be there.

      <li>Title::: 'Some Questions and Thoughts on and relating to Indian History and Histiography.'<br />Body: "What is this sub's opinions on historians(mainly on Romila Thapar,Irfan Habib,RS Sharma,Jadunath Sarkar,RC Majumdar,Richard Eaton,IH Qureshi and SM Ikram) as well as any book recommendations on Indian History and Political Theory.Also,why do Rightwingers hate Marxist and Postcolonial Historians like Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib even though many of these Marxist and Postcolonial Historians glorify India as this golden bird until the British ruined it or atleast this is my impression from their work,i could be wrong though.\n\nAs for my opinion,i think there are 4 schools of Indian History;Hindu,Islamic,Marxist and Post Colonialist.A lot of people mixup Post-Colonial and Marxist Historians but there is a big difference between these schools, Post-Colonial schools are people like Romila Thapar and Richard Eaton who don't view history from a materialistic perspective(i.e things like Class Struggle,impact of money and resources,Caste System and so on) while Marxist historians like Irfan Habib and RS Sharma view history from a materialistic perspective(as elaborated in the previous sentence);Hindu historians like Jadunath Sarkar and RC Majumdar view history from a Hindu Nationalistic perspective while Islamic Historians like SM Ikram view history from a Indo-Muslim nationalistic perspective.All 4 perspectives are pretty accurate and useful in my opinion.\n\nIn my opinion,all 4 perspectives have one thing in common,that India is glorious and awesome until the British ruined it;the main debate in Indian History is whether Muslims assmiliated into India or a separate part of India though other controversies exist like the Aryan Migration(though this controversy is tied to the Muslim question since the reasoning is that if Aryans are migrants then why only Muslims are considered as outsiders.)The Marxists and Post-Colonialists say yes,Hindus say no and the Muslims are divided on this issue(mainly on national lines).As for me,i would say that the Muslims are Indian and that they contributed enroumsly to Indian arts,sciences and culture but they also destroyed and persecuted many portions of Hindu culture.\n\nAlso on a sidenote,this point may sound bit too much like an Islamist but Indian Muslim historians like SM Ikram;Indian Muslim intellectuals and Scientists like Fariduddin Munajjum,Mulla Mahumad Jaunpauri and the Lahori family(people like Ustad Ahmed Lahori) are pretty unknown and underepresented compared to Hindu(l.e JN Sarkar,Aryabhatta,RC Majumdar,Sushrata and so on).Idk why.\n\nEDIT:-Also,before anyone says that Muslims never contributed anything of value to the scientific and intellectutal thought of India.Here's a couple articles on Science in Muslim India and its interaction with Hindu scientific traditions,Mediveal India was no where near comparable to Classical India nor the Muslim Golden Age(i e Baghdad,Andalus and stuff)(the two intellectual periods which influenced Indian scientific thought) in scientific research but it still produced great scientists:-\n\n1)https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/scienza-indiana-periodo-classico-la-scienza-islamica-in-india_%28Storia-della-Scienza%29/     this article is in Italian and is from a famous Italian Encyclopedia,so use google translate to read it in English.\n\n2)[https://www.academia.edu/9284425/Science\\_in\\_India\\_during\\_the\\_Muslim\\_Rule](https://www.academia.edu/9284425/Science_in_India_during_the_Muslim_Rule) ,this article is by a historian of science.This article talks about the Hindu influence on the Muslim Golden Age as well as Muslim scientists and intellectuals of Medieval India.\n\nOn another side note,i hate the term Islamic Golden Age since it credits Islam with the Golden Age;when in reality,it has little to do with the golden age.That's why i use the term the Muslim Golden Age since Muslims are actually responsible for the Golden Age(though Hindu,Christian and Jewish contributors did exist) and not Islam itself"<br />Author: 'ShriDuggalPashaSahib'  id: 'qltsjr'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qltsjr/some_questions_and_thoughts_on_and_relating_to/</li>

Half-asleep and barely attentive, Rajastambha noticed that all the previous guards were also asleep on similar pieces of cloth. \n\n*What a kind soul*.\n\nThe guards of Ajatashatru‚Äôs dungeons had been trained to be completely stoic in their emotion, to not betray the slightest sympathy for their prisoners ‚Äì and to revile any of their members who did. Yet Rajastambha could not prevent himself from feeling sympathy for the boy‚Äôs plight. From what he had gathered, the boy had not harmed anyone, he had merely offered his advice to the emperor, and had politely acquiesced to leave when it was refused. And for that crime, he was to be executed. \n\n‚Äú*Rajastambha*.‚Äù\n\nRajastambha was jolted out of his thoughts.\n\nThe boy Chanakya had prostrated himself before him, and was begging for his life most emotionally. Begging *him* to help him escape from prison.\n\nPanicked at the thought of the other guards waking, he softly hissed: ‚Äú*Quiet!*‚Äù \n\nChanakya seemed to read his thoughts. His voice jittery, he said: ‚ÄúI have put all the other guards to sleep. Please, grant me the boon of life.‚Äù\n\nFrom any typical prisoner, Rajastambha would have remained unmoved ‚Äì wouldn‚Äôt even have considered such a request. \n\nBut this was a request from a friend.\n\nA friend who had *taught* him, and friend whom he *knew*, a friend who had told him profound truths about his own character from merely a short period of playing games. \n\n(And somehow, already having been convinced to socialize with a prisoner in violation of the rules, and already feeling implicated, without cause, in the crime of intoxicating his colleagues, it became acceptable to consider such a proposal.) \n\nThe boy had chosen *him*, left *him* alone un-drugged, he had not offered him any material bribes, instead believing in the goodness in his character. To reject such a proposal felt like a betrayal of this trust, an acknowledgement of the corruption of his own soul.\n\nBut then he recalled what the consequences would be of such treason, and said so in so many words.\n\nChanakya looked at him square in the eyes and said: \n\n‚ÄúWhat did you learn from our game, Rajastambha? The source of the emperor‚Äôs information is in alibis ‚Äì the art of successful deception lies in false alibis. This is not your shift; it is Sulabhin‚Äôs, thus there will not be any evidence of your responsibility in freeing me.‚Äù \n\nThe thought of framing his compatriot and having him executed for a crime of his own filled Rajastambha with disgust and horror, but Chanakya quickly added:\n\n‚ÄúYou may have also observed, Rajastambha, how easy it is to tell a man‚Äôs innocence from his voice and tells; thus Sulabhin will not be believed to be guilty either; the purpose of framing someone is to secure your own alibi, not truly to incriminate them.‚Äù\n\nBefore Rajastambha could argue further, Chanakya fell back onto his knees, folding his hands and begging for freedom.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die,‚Äù he cried, ‚ÄúNot at the age of eleven. I love my life.‚Äù \n\nDespising himself more than he despised anyone else, Rajastambha forced himself to shake his head.\n\nThe sole torch in the cell blew out.\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\nRajastambha gulped audibly.\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\n‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\n\nA sudden burst of light seared his eyeballs.\n\nHe slowly opened his eyes.\n\nThe boy who had just been whimpering and begging for his life now stood upright, the slightest hint of emotion having vanished from his face. His previously white dhoti had turned golden; his left arm was folded with his palm facing to his right, and the other hand was outstretched in blessing. A silver halo emanated from the back of his head.\n\nA peacock feather decorated his untied hair.\n\nRajastambha‚Äôs mind filled in the sound of conch shells being blown.\n\n*I do not mind the fool who knows little,* Chanakya had said after their games. *But a fool who fails to recognize the truth even when it is told to his face in simple terms, even upon seeing it in all its obvious glory, even refuses it ‚Äì that is the mark of a barbarian.* \n\nThe day that Mathura had been razed, Rajastambha had asked the city priest the natural question: *We are told that brighter days will come, that the Heir of Samkarshana will return. How will we know to recognize him, when he does?*\n\nThe priest had pridefully twirled his moustache and asked: *How does one recognize the Sun* *when it rises at dawn?*\n\nHad Magadha truly changed him ‚Äì had he truly turned himself into a barbarian? \n\nWas he now no different from the men who had once slaughtered his countrymen?\n\nHad he forgotten to recognize the Sun?\n\nLord Vasudeva stood before him in all his glory, and yet Rajastambha had not recognized him.\n\n‚ÄúForgive me, lord!‚Äù he cried, falling to his knees. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Do not be very upright in your dealings for you would see by going to the forest that straight trees are cut down while crooked ones are left standing.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPabbata was honestly impressed by his own guile.\n\nHis father had almost immediately caught on to the fact that Pabbata intended to use Chanakya in his own war against his brothers when the day came. Pabbata didn‚Äôt care; his father was too lazy and unmotivated to bother stopping him, and didn‚Äôt quite care who inherited the throne after him. Balding and burping, his repulsive father was hardly a threat to him. \n\n‚ÄúI assure you, father,‚Äù he had said, ‚ÄúThat I am loyal to you and to my brothers. I intend to use Chanakya not against Magadha, but in her service.‚Äù\n\nIf Pabbata had judged Chanakya‚Äôs character correctly, the indignant, idealistic boy would almost certainly, upon being freed, declare himself an enemy of Magadha. Already being remarkably popular in Taxila for his intellect, his activities would undoubtedly catch the attention of other enemies of Magadha who may consult with him or employ him as a figurehead. By being close to Chanakya, Pabbata could spy on these enemies far more efficiently than any of the government spies ever could ‚Äì as well as influence them through Chanakya, thus emerging victorious both ways.\n\nPabbata congratulated himself. He was really starting to believe his own lies.\n\nDhanananda had laughed, asking what use could that Brahmin boy possibly be to his prince.\n\n‚ÄúHe is very na√Øve on matters of understanding people,‚Äù Pabbata had agreed. ‚ÄúThere is no doubt on that. Yet I have spoken to him earlier, and he is of considerable intellect. In fact his naivety is an advantage to us , for it makes him easily exploitable.‚Äù\n\nGrinning, Pabbata had told his father his plan.\n\nHe would approach Chanakya asking for his support against a fratricidal war against his brothers ‚Äì just what his father thought was what he wanted; Chanakya, despite not being in any position to reject his offer, would likely place some kind of condition in exchange for his support, like requiring that Pabbata accept him as his teacher so he could undo his Magadhan upbringing.\n\nAt this point Dhanananda had interjected, pointing out that Pabbata would be a fool to accept that deal.\n\nPabbata had shaken his head. \n\n‚ÄúBut what he doesn‚Äôt realize, and neither do you, father, is that this is no *price* ‚Äì it is precisely that education that I desire from him. I have no ambitions for the throne of Magadha, I truly do not, that rightfully belongs to my brother. I wish to learn his knowledge and use it against him, against the enemies of Magadha, in service of my brothers. That is the plain truth, father.‚Äù \n\nOf course, that was hardly the complete truth: Pabbata absolutely desired the throne of Magadha for himself. Well, every man desired the throne of Magadha for himself, although over the last several generations, the throne of Magadha had proved itself to be the clan whore.\n\nAfter having received advice from Pabbata that later proved true, and after being rescued by him twice from the mouth of death, Chanakya was sure to trust him completely.\n\nSo while Chanakya attempted to re-educate Pabbata in his own image, he would, before he knew it, find himself moulded into Pabbata‚Äôs loyal minister, guide the prince to his victory and then secure the possession acquired in that victory. And if after several years Chanakya proved to be too independent and impervious to such influence, then Pabbata would capture him and all his allies, and march back to Pataliputra a hero, thus securing his victory in that way.\n\nWith either outcome, Pabbata‚Äôs victory was guaranteed.\n\nWith that happy thought, he descended into the dungeons to free Chanakya. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but by wise council keep it secret being determined to carry it into execution.*\n\n‚ÄîKautilya, according to the Chanakya Neeti\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, Chanakya was re-born.\n\nAll his idealism, all his irrational faith in men‚Äôs desire for the truth, indeed all his adorable childlike naivety left him that night.\n\nChanakya had not manipulated a wicked man.\n\nChanakya had manipulated a kind and conscientious man, whose insecurities he had learned on the pretence of befriending him. He had previously sown various powders into a fragment of his dhoti, and under the excuse of offering cushions to the guards, tore off the fragment and held it over his torch, rendering them unconscious with its smoke. He had previously planted the seed in Rajastambha‚Äôs mind of the memory of Vasudeva, exploiting his insecurities so that even a cheap spectacle with some lighting and a peacock feather was sufficient to guilt him into servitude.\n\nHe had given Rajastambha an alibi, not to protect him, but in order to give him false hope. In truth, Dhanananda would almost certainly execute all five guards when Chanakya was found missing in his cell the next morning. Such little value had Chanakya assigned to the guard‚Äôs life, that he had subsequently employed him as his spy in Pataliputra, dooming him to his eventual death even if he were somehow miraculously spared the next day.\n\nChanakya felt no guilt. Such guilt served no purpose.\n\nIt was easy to congratulate himself on his successful escape, but the truth was that it was not his ingenuity that had served him, but pure luck. Had he not happened to meet Pabbata in the courtroom, had Pabbata not intervened on his behalf, had Dhanananda not heard his son and agreed to delay the execution, had the guards refused point-blank from socializing with him ‚Ä¶ had any *one* of those occurrences gone wrong, Chanakya would have been dead.\n\nChanakya had been a fool to simply march into the empire of darkness, into its capital city and directly into the dwelling of the very source of that darkness that was its king.\n\nA throne so powerful, yet so unstable as to pass from king to king each decade through executions, was hardly a throne that could be trusted. All of Professor Chanaka‚Äôs preparations had been based on his knowledge of the previous king Mahapadma; he had had no idea of the extent of Dhanananda‚Äôs barbarism.\n\nHe had been a fool to not bother learning about a barbarian king from his people before speaking to him. \n\nHe had been a fool to not make a detailed escape plan in advance, to not *strategize* in advance, were the situation to go awry. \n\nHe had been a fool to neglect Pabbata‚Äôs advice without considering that it may have been based even partially in truth.\n\nHe had been a fool to not question Pabbata or anyone else further on what the consequences of such an interaction might be; had he done so, he may have learned of Dhanananda‚Äôs casual homicidal proclivities a bit earlier and have had the time to escape. \n\nHe had been a fool to not leave the city upon receiving news of how the king had treated the attendant who had requested his audience.\n\nHe had been a fool to not realize what he‚Äôd gotten himself into even after the emperor had mentioned his execution of the wrestlers and dancers.\n\nNow as he walked along the Northern Highway that moonless night, disguised as an Ajivika monk, Chanakya thought, for the first time, about human nature.\n\n\\[Most prison escapees preferred to wear more clothes, not less, to conceal themselves. Chanakya, too, had no desire to roam Pataliputra naked in the winter ‚Äì however, disguising himself as a merchant would have required him to carry merchandise, and a Brahmin scholar in the Nanda capital would be seen as so odd that to assume that identity would certainly expose him. Pataliputra had no secret tunnels, either; the engineering feat of building tunnels out of a water fort was restricted to the Vedic cities to its West ‚Äì this raised some security questions about surrounding cities.\\]\n\nNot in the abstract sense that he had discussed in the *Arthashastra*. It was economics, the science of his own development, that contained the laws that governed the behaviour of men. He had described the manner in which men pursued their goals, and the manner in which they ought to. \n\nBut he had never put any critical thought into questioning his conception of what these goals actually *were*.\n\nExecuting a scholar who came to his court offering cheap information was *stupid*.\n\nEven if Dhanananda had truly believed Chanakya‚Äôs advice to be incorrect, adopting such a policy would only discourage his subjects from attempting to advise him, or even interacting him in any way, depriving him of critical information and support. Did that, then, contradict Chanakya‚Äôs theories?\n\nNo. His theories were based in pure reason. But in his natural childish idealism, Chanakya had assumed that all men desired to know the truth, that all men cared about what they professed to care about, that all men cared at least for their own personal wealth. \n\nDhanananda didn‚Äôt enjoy wealth.\n\nHe enjoyed *looking decisive and powerful*.\n\nYet a single interjection from Pabbata had been sufficient to get the emperor to retract his order.\n\nBecause Dhanananda enjoyed *looking statesmanly*.\n\nChanakya tried to imagine what the emperor‚Äôs reaction would have been if someone else had interjected, saying, ‚ÄúNo, actually just kill this kid, he‚Äôs kind of annoying.‚Äù His mind generated an image of Dhanananda sneering: ‚ÄúWhy do you bother me with quibbles on such minor logistic details? The Brahmin boy‚Äôs execution is scheduled for tomorrow at noon. Any objectors will be executed alongside him.‚Äù\n\nBecause Dhanananda enjoyed *looking high-status*.\n\nThe greater number of common people ‚Äì including kings and such ‚Äì didn‚Äôt truly value what they claimed to value. \n\nA king who said he cared about his people would bankrupt the royal treasury on wasteful government programs that benefit no one and end up raising taxes to unbearable levels. Because such a king did not truly care about his people ‚Äì he cared about *appearing* to care about his people.\n\nA king who said he cared about his personal wealth would lavishly display his wealth and ornaments leading to financial mismanagement and his eventual bankruptcy. Because such a king did not truly care about being wealthy ‚Äì he cared about *appearing* wealthy.\n\nA king who claimed to be a scholarly king who cared about the truth would often a time choose philosophers of particularly stupid ideologies as his advisors. Because such a king did not truly care about the truth ‚Äì he cared about *appearing* to care about the truth.\n\nAnd such was the nature of pretentious society, that people invested themselves into confirming these self-descriptions of their friends. A man who claimed himself to be intelligent, or who spoke with such lexicon and walked with such gait as to signal thus, would have his intellect spoken highly of in such a society, and none would so much as tease him for actions that betrayed his stupidity.\n\nThus the argument for why a king ought to surround himself with sharp-tongued Brahmin ministers who were possessed of a tradition of frank honesty, and who didn‚Äôt resort to flattery.\n\nWhat Chanakya had witnessed that day was a clash of cultures in its truest sense: between the scholarship of the enlightened Vedic culture and the mindless mutual self-indulgences of the barbaric Magadhas. The cause for such a clash was man‚Äôs proclivity to assume that everyone who looked sufficiently similar to him must also think sufficiently similarly to him.\n\n*That* was Chanakya‚Äôs answer to Professor Chanaka‚Äôs claim many years ago that the notions of ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù and ‚Äúbarbarian‚Äù were artificial constructs invented for some political purpose. Their true purpose was to remind men to be cautious among barbarians, to study their customs in detail without assuming any of those customs to be similar to one‚Äôs own. \n\nWhy Magadha? There were non-Vedic cultures in which even mere words and symbols were considered blasphemous, and where every member of these cultures defended so vigorously these obviously irrational social norms. It was essential that such a culture be described as barbarian so that travellers could better protect their selves. \n\nBy erring on something which would have been so obvious to any traveller, Chanakya had proved himself still seriously lacking in sense.\n\n*I have to raise the level at which I think.*\n\n*I have to learn the art of cunning.*\n\nChanakya thought back to his last conversation with Rajastambha.\n\n‚ÄúI wish I could say that I helped you to save myself from committing the sin of *Brahmahatya* \\[2\\],‚Äù Rajastambha had said, ‚ÄúBut in truth, I have been complicit to that crime so many times in the past that I could not possibly make up for it with one good deed.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe concept of atoning for one‚Äôs sins is the fallacy of Magadhi philosophy,‚Äù Chanakya had replied, ‚ÄúThe goal of life is not to merely ensure that one does more good than bad, it is not to merely justify your existence in the world. The goal of life is to do as much good as possible, and that rarely comes from men who justify their actions on basis of *doing good*. Therein lies the distinction, between a *good man* and a *great man* (*Purushottama* \\[3\\]).‚Äù\n\n(From there he had claimed that Rajastambha could do the most good by serving him in Pataliputra as his spy, carrying out and reporting small tasks for Chanakya.)\n\nBut despite the truth of these words, however, Chanakya found himself pronouncing a very particular oath, motivated by the cause that Rajastambha‚Äôs impending death not be in vain.\n\nHe did not intend to publicize this oath to anyone, not even to Professor Chanaka, not even by means of any visual indicators, for secrecy until cause arrived to be public was the way of wisdom.\n\nHe did not stop or slow down; he continued to walk at the brisk pace that he had judged to be optimal, without a waver in his step. He merely turned his head to look at the walls of Pataliputra as they faded into the distance.\n\nFor that night, Chanakya gained a true understanding of his own ambition, and made an honest acknowledgement of the means that were required of him to achieve that ambition.\n\n*I swear to uproot you, Dhanananda, and the very culture you represent: that last dark corner of India yet unconquered by the light of the Vedas, I shall conquer it. I swear to wield, and bring to Pataliputra, that bright torch that the Bharatas \\[4\\] had borne so many years against the Purus ‚Äì on that throne that you forbade me from resting on, I shall place a far greater king, who shall obey my word, and proclaim him Chakravarti \\[5\\]. I swear to adopt the art of cunning; to be restrained by no foolish idealisms; to employ any means necessary to accomplish these goals; so that for centuries forth, it will be known: that Magadha, after conquering Mathura, found herself conquered by her.* \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\[1\\] *dhoti* ‚Äì traditional Indian lower garment for men\n\n\\[2\\] *brahmahatya* ‚Äì murder of a Brahmin, considered the worst of sins in Vedic India; even governments were forbidden from issuing the death penalty to Brahmins\n\n\\[3\\] *Purushottama* ‚Äì ‚Äúthe greatest of men‚Äù, an epithet used to refer to Krishna\n\n\\[4\\] *Bharatas* ‚Äì etymologically, ‚Äútorch-bearers‚Äù; the tribe that emerged victorious in the Battle of the Ten Kings; all subsequent noble lines claimed descent from them, the *Mahabharata* takes its name from them, and the modern Indian endonym also comes from them. \n\n\\[5\\] *Chakravarti* ‚Äì world-emperor\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is part of a story I\'m writing called *The Great Empire*, a fictionalized account of Kautilya\'s rise to power and the formation of the Mauryan empire. As it is a fictional work based on history whose precise details are not known or vary greatly between primary sources, many elements of the story may be jarring to readers familiar with modern, "medievalized" adaptations. See the Preface for a list of specific plot points that some readers may find offensive.\n\n[*Link to FictionPress book*](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3359031/7/The-Great-Empire)'<br />Author: 'sri_mahalingam'  id: 'qlr19e'<br />Score:29<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qlr19e/the_great_empire_ch_1_takshashila_khanda_15_the/</li>
      <li>Title::: "The attack on Diwali isn't new and isn't limited to ad campaigns and legal petitions. Historically the attacks were more direct and dangerous."<br />Body: "On Diwali day in November 2004 Jayendra Saraswati, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi was arrested on trumped up charges of a brutal murder clearly committed by professionals. \n\nThere was very little public response in Tamil Nadu upon his arrest, except Brahmin groups performing yagnas and lighting lamps. VHP and RSS conducted a few political protests that didn't gain momentum. The larger Hindu community remained mute.\n\nThe Shankaracharya was completely acquitted after nine years during which he endured many periods in judicial custody. \n\nCiting a lot of political interference the defense counsel petitioned to have the hearings in any other state, after strong opposition from the prosecution, it was moved to Puducherry. \n\n84 of 181 prosecution witnesses thankfully turned hostile which prompted the Judge to remark that there was police or other pressure on them to give false evidence in the first place.\n\nThe Puducherry court that pronounced the verdict on the trial noted that **fair and proper trial was not performed** in the case by the investigation officer due to the active involvement of SP Premkumar in the case beyond what is specified law. Nobody was punished for the trauma and upset this political arrest had caused. A certain section of the Tamil media even now spreads lies and calumny about the Acharya.\n\n&gt; **‚ÄúDuring the Cabinet meeting, I was extremely critical of the timing of the arrest and questioned if the basic tenets of secularism of the Indian state were confined only to Hindu monks and seers? Would the state machinery dare to arrest a Muslim cleric during Id festivities?‚Äù**\n\n&gt; Mr. Mukherjee wrote he was furious over the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi in November 2004 on Diwali day.\n\n&gt; [The Coalition Years, Pranab Mukherjee](https://i.imgur.com/BHUqBGo.jpg) The President's memoirs\n\nDetails of what happened are not clear since the Shankaracharya never once spoke publicly about the issue. J Sai Deepak mentions in passing in [this Tamil interview](https://youtu.be/6XnIsuBOg-4) that this false murder case has silenced all the monks and monastics in TN from speaking out against theft of temple property and lands, because they fear a similar fate. This is what happens when our saints have a moral code that goes back to before Kali Yuga where a sannyasi is never supposed to defend himself from defamation, since even his reputation is supposed to be a material possession that a Sanyasi has to renounce. \n\nLet us recall that Ajit Doval the NSA of India had to personally meet the cleric of the Markaz last year to request the Tablighi Jamaat to vacate the premises of illegal aliens. They came out spitting and kicking.\n\nSo if you behave like a gangster, you get the sensitive treatment, even then their cases were heard and disposed off double quick, but if you're a saintly soft monk you get thrown in jail with no bail for several months. \n\nUpholding the highest standards of monasticism the Shankaracharya never once gave an interview or complained about ill treatment or police harassment and torture to the press. Thus the world never knows the tragic fate of those who are too noble to even defend themselves. What a  civilization we have created in independent India.\n\nTo this day the apathy of the Hindus continues - unless Hindus defend their faith as one there's little hope of fair treatment.\n\nA petition filed by Swami Dayananda Saraswati challenging the legal validity of the TNHRCE act hasn't been posted for a single hearing the SC since 2012."<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'qlo1be'<br />Score:284<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qlo1be/the_attack_on_diwali_isnt_new_and_isnt_limited_to/</li>

After it is done, the entire senate votes whether or not the candidate must be appointed and if the candidate wins he is the judge for life.\n\nWhat if india amends the constitution and appoints judges in a similar manner too? the supreme court in india has been increasingly liberal and is in a power struggle with the executive at some instances.  An extremely liberal court could mean that a right wing party's laws could be unecessarily billed as unconstitutional and be declared void, even now the court is sorta hostile towards the ruling party ( my view) in the pegasus issue. what if india make slight tweaks to the US model like by appointing judges to a fixed time period. India's supreme court may become too liberal as the judges are only going to nominate like minded people into their positions.  curious to know your takes on this or would you suggest something better?"<br />Author: 'HauntingHoliday4927'  id: 'qla55m'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qla55m/should_india_appoint_supreme_court_judges_like/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The "PewDiePie vs T-Series" movement was extremely Racist towards Indians ; And how Self-Hating Indians have ruined the reputation of other Indians'<br />Body: 'I made this post a few days ago on r/DesiMeta. I felt I should post it here too.\n\nAs we all know, the Internet today is extremely hostile and racist towards Indians. In my experience, around 60% of the Non-Indian population on the Internet is either extremely racist towards Indians or (in the very least) does not hold a favourable view of Indians.\n\n\n**Number 1** :\n\nThis "Wave of Hatred" against Indians can mostly be traced back to **PewDiePie**. "Normalise" would be an understatement, he actually "popularised" racism towards Indians. Nowadays, it has become "cool" to be racist towards Indians.\n\nIn his videos and disstracks against T-Series* (it actually wasn\'t against T-Series, he just used T-Series as a **proxy to attack Indians**), he made several racist statements like :- \n\n1)   "Motu-Patlu what the fk is that even supposed to mean, **your language sounds like it came from a mumble-rap community**"\n\n2)   "**But you India you lose, so best think you haven\'t won**"\n\n3)   "**Guess to beat one Swedish Boy you need a Billion Asians**"\n\n4)   "**I\'m a Blue Eyes White Dragon while you\'re just Dark Magician**" - Double Meaning Line\n\n{ In this statement, He (Pewdiepie) is trying to covertly say that he is superior to us Indians because he is White and has Blue Eyes and we are darker skinned than him while maintaining **plausible deniability**.\n\n"Blue Eyes White Dragon" and "Dark Magician" are actually "Battle Cards" from a popular Anime called Yu-Gi-Oh. The "White dragon" card is more powerful than the "Dark Magician" card.\n\nThis is why i refer to this statement as a Double Meaning Statement. }\n\n\n5)  "You got a fifth of the Population in your Nation, but I got nine year olds of world so hold your **defecation** - Double Meaning Line (aimed at poor people and tribals in India)\n\n\n6)  PewDiePie in his videos also framed all Indian Men as Rapists and Creepy Perverts. \n\n\nDespite him saying all this racist stuff, the self-hating and mentally colonised Indians continued to support him. And whenever anyone raised their voice against this, they were immediately shut down by the self-haters and fanboys by saying - \n\n"InDiAnS cAn\'T tAkE a JoKe" \n\n "i\'M iNdIaN aNd I dOn\'T fInD tHiS rAcIsT" \n\n\nIf it weren\'t for these self haters, all Indians could have united and declared the "PewDiePie vs T-Series" movement as racist and we wouldn\'t be suffering so much today üòî.\n\n\n**Number 2** :\n\n It goes without mentioning how self-haters have completely ruined the reputation of Indians on Youtube and Reddit .\n\nEverytime when you\'ll find a blantantly Racist and Xenophobic Video/Post/Comment aimed at Indians, there will be many Indians in the Comment Section saying - "YeS SaAr, WhAt YoU aRe SaYiNg iS TrUe" - even though the video/post/comment might be **Propaganda**, **False** or just **plain Exaggeration**.\n\nSome self-haters are so idiotic that they will drag India into conversations that aren\'t even remotely related to India, and then they will start sh1tting on India so that they can get validation from foreigners.\n\n\n**Number 3**:\n\n There are many sub-reddits on Reddit that exist for the sole purpose of abusing and making fun of Indians (for example : r/indianpeoplefacebook and r/indianpeoplequora). \n\n And (surprise-suprise) do you know who runs these sub-reddits? - **Indians**.\nI mean, do these people have any self respect left at this point?\n\n\n**Conclusion / TLDR** : \n\nThe "PewDiePie vs T-Series" movement was extremely racist towards Indians and this movement popularised racism and hatred towards Indians. It has now become "cool" to be racist towards Indians.\n\nThis trend really worries me becuase even if India overcomes all adversities and becomes a Developed Nation in the future, other people will continue to disrespect us and abuse us because racism against us has become so normalised and common, and the Self-Hating Indians will gladly join hands with the perpetrators to abuse their own countrymen. \n\nHow will we even counter something that is present on such a large-scale everywhere?'<br />Author: 'RishiMuni46'  id: 'ql1obe'<br />Score:491<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ql1obe/the_pewdiepie_vs_tseries_movement_was_extremely/</li>

I don't think we have many achievements to cause pollution every year just for some entertainment.\n\nHowever I believe that it's okay to fire few crackers on new year as the west is the innovation capital of the world and caus they are the sole reason humanity is moving forward despite their dark past. Almost every modern equipment/gadget we are using has come from there (the innovation itself, not the manufacturing). I believe we would still be living in heirachies of caste solely rely on agriculture if not for the west.\n\nI think it's time we recognize how much of a burden we have been on earth's resources for the value we are adding back to it. We should gladly cut down on pollution like crackers since we can't cut down on vehicle or coal related pollution since we need it to grow. In my opinion, we need to have some accountability and not be proud of the culture of monks under trees or glorifying the past of different kingdoms fighting each other. The existential threat is no more. We are too big to fail now.

The UPSC is itself compromised. They choose the wokest candidates out of all. Questions in UPSC about social justice often expect you to write answers which take the most extreme woke stance. As such, our bureaucrats are largely NOT Nationalists, but rather tend towards ideas that are taken up by the extreme left in Western nations. There is very little the political leadership can do about this. India is a dictatorship of the bureaucracy.\n\n---\n**Judiciary**\n\nThe Supreme Court on the other hand chooses its judges through the collegium system. Basically, India's SC is another dictatorship. The same 500 families that controlled the Supreme Court since the British Raj are still controlling it today. The SC rejects any reform. (See: NJAC) This is India's deep state. You or me cannot vote them out, or protest against them. We can only change the elected government. But the elected government is the ONLY branch of government that considers the will of the Indian people. The other two do not.\n\nAll the woke bullshit in India is be perpetrated by these two institutions. It was the bureaucrats that came up with this idea of introducing trannies into our schools and feeding our kids with puberty blockers. It was the SC that came up with getting women into the army.Most of these people have no stake in India and the collegium judges and bureaucrats would flee to a Western nation the moment the country experiences trouble.\n\n---\n\n**A reform of the judicial system and removal of the current bureaucratic system is the only way out of this.**"<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'qkmq7h'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qkmq7h/the_indian_deep_state_full_explanation/</li>

Discussion does not have to be related to India. Please share your thoughts and interesting news articles in the comments. Here are a few to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top Stories\n\n1. [Anglo-French fishing dispute erupts](https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-threatens-retaliation-in-an-explosive-anglo-french-fishing-dispute/6270269.html)\n\nThe UK and France erupted into a bitter war of words over fishing rights around the Channel Islands, a small archipelago near France that has been under British control for centuries. French fishermen have traditionally enjoyed fishing rights within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the islands, but following Brexit, the UK government has been routinely curtailing those rights, France alleges. Britain, on the other hand, says that it has the sovereign right to determine who gets to use its EEZ after Brexit. France has threatened economic sanctions against the UK and has repeatedly urged the EU to take the country to arbitration. The two countries sent coast guard ships to "fight" each other around the disputed waters.\n\n2. [Taliban calls for recognition of new Afghan regime](https://news.yahoo.com/taliban-says-failure-recognise-government-162607132.html)\n\nFacing a growing humanitarian crisis and a shortage of funds to deal with it, Taliban spokesperson  Zabihullah Mujahid called on the US and other countries to formally recognize the new regime, unlocking frozen funds abroad as well as enabling donors to resume funding. No country has recognize the Taliban regime, although many high-level visits have taken place, the latest being the foreign minister of Turkmenistan Rasit Meredow, with the obvious blessings of Russia.\n\n3. [New COVID-19 outbreak in China](https://news.yahoo.com/chinas-covid-19-outbreak-developing-020148934.html)\n\nChina, a country that claims to have administered over 2 billion doses of its homegrown vaccines to its entire population, is battling a new outbreak of the Delta variant. An entire train full of passengers was put into quarantine in Inner Mongolia province, after one passenger was traced as a close contact of a positive case.

[Japanese PM projected to win election](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/31/japan-election-kishida-517915)\n\n Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who called for a snap election after being elected to lead his party, appeared set to retain control in parliament as his coalition is projected to retain a majority, although a diminished one. His party previously held 305 seats in the 465 member lower house, but is projected to win only 239-288 this time round by pollsters. His Liberal Democratic Party, despite the name, is a right wing party that campaigned on recovery from COVID-19 and pushing back against China. The opposition instead focused on corruption and gender equality, the latter issue being a very sticky point in a deeply conservative society. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Cambridge Five\n\nIn the world of spycraft, the most valuable asset are humans - and they are also the most difficult to recruit. What turns a person to spy for the enemy? Many things are possible - money (the most common), threats to loved ones, and even love affairs. But perhaps the most potent means to acquire spies is ideological - convince someone on the other side that their side is evil, and you have a spy that will continue to work for decades at little cost. Moreover, ideological spies tend to be from the powerful class of society - people who have all the comforts in life to have the time to think deeply about ideology. They usually hold a lot of useful keys too. \n\nIn the years following the Russian Revolution, when the Communists took control and created the USSR, ideology became a huge point of friction in the world. The Soviets displayed Marxism-Leninism as the solution to all problems in society, a system where a benevolent dictatorship "of the people" would provide for all needs. This was juxtaposed with the rest of the free world, where capitalism created inequality and suffering. Of course, the greatness of the Soviet system was all propaganda, but for five young, well to do graduates of Cambridge University in the 1930s, it was pretty convincing. \n\nDonald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Harold Philby, Anthon Blunt, and John Cairncross were all high ranking British diplomats and members of MI5 and MI6, different branches of British Military Intelligence (MI). In the 1930s, fascism and eugenics were all the rage in continental Europe, and had many admirers in Britain and America as well. Those that opposed these ideas were largely restricted to universities and Leftist discussion groups - but once those students graduated, their ideas lived on. Maclean and Burgess were two such students in Cambridge. Once they graduated, Maclean became a British diplomat while Burgess became a BBC correspondent, and they immediately commenced passing sensitive information to the Soviet Union, which went on through WW2 and even part of the Cold War. Philby, who was born in British India, worked as a journalist, then in MI6, and finally as first secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, DC. He worked as a Soviet spy throughout this time. Blunt was a historian that worked with the Royal Palace and worked with MI5 during WW2, when he passed on sensitive information to the Soviets (although they were allies at the time). Cairncross was similar, having become a Soviet spy in the 1930s and going on to leak information about the new NATO alliance and Britain\'s atomic programme after WW2. \n\nThe uncovering of the Cambridge Five was a drawn out process that started with Maclean and Burgess, who had drinking problems and often slipped their secrets into the public, defected to the Soviet Union in 1956. British MI was so stunned that a formal arrest warrant was not issued for them till 1962. However, their defections put Philby in a bind, as suspicion around him began to grow. He resigned from MI6, when Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn named him as part of a "ring of five" spies. He eventually defected to the Soviet side in the dark of the night in Beirut, where he spent the rest of his life virtually under house arrest. Because of his exceptionally high position, Philby was a particular blow to the British, with the Americans holding back from intelligence sharing for fear of even more moles in Britain. \n\nNo wonder then that Blunt and Cairncross were handled more carefully. The exact time when their treachery became known is not clear, but it was kept under wraps, with both being granted immunity by British officials. Blunt\'s role as a spy was only revealed in 1979 by an investigative journalist, and his own confession was only published in 2009, 25 years after his death. Similarly, Cairncross\' role as a spy became public only in 1979, when he himself confessed to a journalist, making him the "fifth man" in the Golitsyn\'s ring. However, unlike all the others, he insisted that he had never hurt British interests, and his immunity from prosecution meant that he was a free man. Nonetheless, the story of the Cambridge Five sent shockwaves through western intelligence - five well-off, high ranking men who had defected for ideological reasons alone. It sparked off a great fear in America that their own officials could be ideologically "impure" - an event known as the Red Scare, which led to a purge of alleged anti-American people from public life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Have a question on geopolitics?

My family is almost like a mini representative of India, some support the left and others support the right but mostly they\'re on the right. But still, they are all a huge fans of cricket and mostly fans on Virat Kohli.\n\nEverything isn\'t going well in our country. It hasn\'t even been a month since the attack on Pandits in J&amp;K and the subsequent attack on our soldiers. What happened in Pulwama couple years ago was also gruesome and heart wrenching. On one hand, Pakistan is killing our soldiers and on other, I see Kohli and Harbhajan doing *jhappian* with Pak cricket players.\n\nNow, I understand that sportsmanship is different and doesn\'t have anything to do with national interests (that is what a pseudo liberal like Barkha or Rajdeep will tell us!). However, when I think from a soldier\'s perspective, I see them batting against a gruesome enemy and taking bullets on their bodies so that people like us can watch cricket comfortably on our TV screens, this is the uncomfortable truth that I refuse to live with. I thus argued this point with my family members and asked them to boycott cricket. \n\nBy watching cricket, we are enabling people like Kohli and Harbhajan who seem to live in a totally different world. They probably see them Pakis as just another team and not the enablers of "Kashmir banega Pakistan" narrative peddled by their country\'s ISI. But I refuse to see just this partial truth where ugly and stinking parts are hidden beneath the carpet. I have decided to boycott watching cricket until BCCI makes it a mandate that our players will wear a black ribbon as a protest mark for people killed in J&amp;K due to their sponsored terrorism whenever they play against Pakistan.\n\nOf course, my family members laugh when I tell this and tell me to forget all this and just chill and watch cricket. To which I reply that what happens if the soldier at Siachen also thinks like this: *These guys seem to be doing jhappis and chilling while watching cricket, why am I wasting my time here? Let me also go and join them.* Have you ever thought what will happen in that case?\n\nI couldn\'t convince my own family members but I still want to voice my perspective and try to convince as many as possible. By watching cricket, we are enabling a crooked Lutyens mentality which doesn\'t play for the country but just for their salaries and BYJUS ad money. But the other side plays it as jihad as their coach Ramiz Raja himself declared in a Youtube video. What do you think? Are we doing the right thing by enabling an ecosystem which doesn\'t even care about the country and their consumer\'s sentiments?

Now obviously, the political machinery that had so casually ignored the brewing conflict till the time it was *literally* on them, demanded that heads should roll and a public report should be drafted and published.  \n\n\nThis responsibility was delegated to [General T.B Henderson Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._B._Henderson_Brooks)\\- one of the few Anglo-Indian officers to serve in the Indian Army at that time- and [Brigadier General Premindra Singh Bhagat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premindra_Singh_Bhagat)\\- a Victoria Cross Recipient during World War II and the Director of Military Intelligence at that time. The Henderson Brooks- Bhagat Report would remain the most controversial report in the modern military history of the Indian Republic. [Posting a few excerpts from the declassified parts of the report as given by Neville Maxwell:-](https://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/AnIntroductiontotheHendersonBrooks.pdf)  \n\n\n*India at the time of independence can be said to have faced no external threats. True, it was born into a relationship of permanent belligerency with its weaker Siamese twin Pakistan, left by the British inseparably conjoined to India by the member of Kashmir, vital to both new national organisms; but that may be seen as essentially an internal dispute, an untreatable complication left by the crude, cruel surgery of partition. In 1947 China, wracked by civil war, was in what appeared to be death throes and no conceivable threat to anyone. That changed with astonishing speed and by 1950, when the newborn People\'s Republic re-established in Tibet the central authority which had lapsed in 1911, the Indian Government will have made its initial assessment of the possibility and potential of a threat from China and found those to be minimal, if not non-extent. First, there were geographic and topographical factors, the great mountain chains which lay between the two neighbors and appeared to make large-scale troop movements impractical. More importantly, the leadership of the Indian Government - which is to say, Jawaharlal Nehru - had for years proclaimed that the unshakable friendship between India and China would be the key to both their futures and therefore Asia\'s, even the worlds. The new leaders in Beijing were charier, viewing India through their Marxist prism as a potentially hostile bourgeois state. But from the Indian political perspective war with China was deemed unthinkable and through the 1950s New Delhi\'s defense planning and expenditure expressed that confidence. By the early 1950s, however, the Indian government, which is to say Nehru and his acolyte officials, had shaped and adopted a policy whose implementation would make armed conflict with China not only \'thinkable\' but inevitable. From the first days of India\'s independence, it was appreciated that the Sino-Indian borders had been left undefined by the departing British and that territorial disputes with China were part of India\'s inheritance. China\'s other neighbors faced similar problems and over the succeeding decades of the century, almost all of those were to settle their borders satisfactorily through the normal process of diplomatic negotiation with Beijing. The Nehru government decided upon the opposite approach. India would through its own research determine the appropriate alignments of the Sino-Indian borders, extend its administration to make those good on the ground, and then refuse to negotiate the result. Barring the inconceivable - that Beijing would allow India to impose China\'s borders unilaterally and annex territory at will - Nehru\'s policy thus willed conflict without foreseeing it.*  \n\n\n*Through the 1950s, that policy generated friction along the borders and so bred and steadily increased distrust, growing into hostility, between the neighbors. By 1958 Beijing was urgently calling for a stand-still agreement to prevent patrol clashes and negotiations to agree on boundary alignments. India refused any standstill agreement since such would be an impediment to intended advances and insisted that there was nothing to negotiate, the Sino-Indian borders being already settled on the alignments claimed by India, through a blind historical process. Then it began accusing China of committing \'aggression by refusing to surrender to Indian claims. From 1961 the Indian attempt to establish an armed presence in all the territory it claimed and then extrude the Chinese were being exerted by the Army and Beijing was warning that if India did not desist from its expansionist thrust, Chinese forces would have to hit back. On October 12, 1962, Nehru proclaimed India\'s intention to drive the Chinese out of areas India claimed. That bravado had by then been forced upon him by the public expectations which his charges of \'Chinese aggression\' had aroused, but Beijing took it as in effect a declaration of war. The unfortunate Indian troops on the front line, under orders to sweep superior Chinese forces out of their impregnable, dominating positions, instantly appreciated the implications: "If Nehru had declared his intention to attack, then the Chinese were not going to wait to be attacked".On October 20 the Chinese launched a pre-emptive offensive all along the borders, overwhelming the feeble - but in this first instance determined - resistance of the Indian troops and advancing some distance in the eastern sector. On October 24 Beijing offered a ceasefire and Chinese withdrawal on condition India agreed to open negotiations: Nehru refused the offer even before the text was officially received. Both sides built up over the next three weeks and the Indians launched a local counterattack on November 15, arousing in India fresh expectations of total victory. The Chinese then renewed their offensive. Now many units of the once crack Indian 4th Division dissolved into rout without giving battle and by November 20 there was no organized Indian resistance anywhere in the disputed territories. On that day Beijing announced a unilateral ceasefire and intention to withdraw its forces: Nehru this time tacitly accepted.*  \n\n\n*Naturally, the Indian political public demanded to know what had brought about the shameful debacle suffered by their Army and on December 14 a new Army Commander, Lt General J N Chaudhuri, instituted an Operations Review for that purpose, assigning the task of inquiry to Lt General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier P S Bhagat. Factionalisation of the Army: All colonial armies are liable to suffer from the tugs of contradictory allegiance and in the case of India\'s that fissure was opened in the second world war by Japan\'s recruitment from prisoners of war of the \'Indian National Army\' to fight against their former fellows. By the beginning of the 1950s two factions were emerging in the officer corps, one patriotic but above all professional and apolitical and orthodox in adherence to the regimental traditions established in the century of the Raj; the other nationalist, ready to respond unquestioningly to the political requirements of their civilian masters and scorning their rivals as fuddy-duddies still aping the departed rulers and suspected as being of doubtful loyalty to the new ones. The latter faction soon took on eponymous identification from its leader, B M Kaul.*    \n\n\n[Neville Maxwell Would directly attack Kaul\'s appointment as the Chief of Army](https://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/AnIntroductiontotheHendersonBrooks.pdfhttps://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/AnIntroductiontotheHendersonBrooks.pdf), who had in his words:-\n\n *At the time of independence Kaul appeared to be a failed officer, if not disgraced. Although Sandhurst trained for infantry service he had eased through the war without serving on any front line and ended it in a humble and obscure post in public relations. But his courtier wiles, irrelevant or damning until then, were to serve him brilliantly in the new order that independence brought after he came to the notice of Nehru, a fellow Kashmiri brahmin and indeed distant kinsman. Boosted by the prime minister\'s steady favoritism, Kaul rocketed up through the army structure to emerge in 1961 at the very summit of Army HQ. Not only did he hold the key appointment of chief of the general staff (CGS) but the Army Commander, Thapar, was in effect his client.*    \n\n\nNot only was the Army involved in the entire fiasco, [but India\'s oldest intel agency, the Intelligence Bureau was not only involved but was also updating the CIA Station Chief in the US Embassy in New Delhi:-](https://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/AnIntroductiontotheHendersonBrooks.pdf)  \n\n\n*Through the early 1950s, Nehru\'s covertly expansionist policy had been implemented by armed border police under the Intelligence Bureau (IB), whose director, NB Mullik, was another favorite and confidant of the prime minister. The Army\'s high command, knowing its forces to be too weak to risk conflict with China, would have nothing to do with it. Indeed when the potential for Sino-Indian conflict inherent in Mullik\'s aggressive forward patrolling was demonstrated in the serious clash at the Kongka Pass in October 1959, Army HQ and the Ministry of External Affairs united to denounce him as a provocateur, insist that control over all activities on the border be assumed by the Army, which thus could insulate China from Mullik\'s jabs.*   \n\n\n*Another question arises: Who, in those years, would most have welcomed the great falling-out which saw India shift in a few years from strong international support for the People\'s Republic of China to enmity and armed conflict with it? From founding and leading the non-aligned movement to tacit enlistment in the hostile encirclement of China which was Washington\'s aim? Mullik maintained close links with the CIA station head in New Delhi, Harry Rossitsky. Answers may lie in the agency\'s archives.*  \n\n\nThe explosive contents of this report led to a massive purge in the Indian Armed Forces as many senior officials were sacked along with the Minister of Defense VK Krishna Menon resigning and Nehru\'s legacy being permanently stained in the annals of history. The entire report was deemed too sensitive for public release and was thrown in the deep dark dungeons of the govt.\'s archives, never to be revealed again. This was the beginning of the information blackout of the civilian government for all military and foreign policy affairs- which continues even today. In 1970, Australian journalist Neville Maxwell would leak Vol. 1 of the Henderson Brooks- Bhagat Report. [His interview transcript with the South China Morning Post is posted here](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1461102/neville-maxwell-interview-full-transcript), with an interesting excerpt that highlights Nehru\'s initial forebodings with China and what eventually motivated him:-   \n \n\n***Post:*** *Ever wondered why Nehru, a known China ally, took such a strong line?*\n\n***Neville Maxwell:*** *On that, I have come to some answers, guided by scholars like David Hoffman and Perry Anderson. Their reading is that the Indian leaders felt insulted by Zhou Enlai‚Äôs insistence on negotiations as they felt it impugned India‚Äôs character as an ancient nation with defined boundaries.*  \n\n\nNeville Maxwell would go on to write a well-detailed book: *India\'s China War* in which he would completely tear apart Nehru\'s Military strategy of needlessly provoking China and goading it into a war with India- a war that India could never have won given its abysmal military conditions.   \n\n\n  \n**2) India\'s Military Reforms of the 1960s: More Funding, More Toys, and More Troops**  \n\n\nFollowing its defeat in the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Indian Armed Forces realized it had to abandon the PMS Blackett methodology of territorial defense and create a more aggressive posture in defense- which would require a major increase in funding.

Nevertheless, India underwent a massive military expansion at that, which I will highlight in the following points:-  \n\n\n1) Establishment of the Research and Analysis Wing- India\'s premier external intelligence agency-  by the CIA Special Activities Division and provision of funding and training support for the first R&amp;AW personnel, aided by MI6 and Mossad.  \n\n\n2) [Purchase of Military Equipment from the Soviet Union which includes the following:](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643691?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A36b6c66c8383091b5a601538bd26a9e7&amp;seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents)  \n\n\n\\- MiG-21 Bison Fighters  \n\\- T-55 Main Battle Tanks  \n\\- AK-47 Rifles  \n\\- SA-2 Air Defense Missiles  \n\\- Guided Missile Cruisers  \n\\- Destroyers  \n\\- Corvettes  \n\\- Anti Ship Missiles  \n\\- Minesweepers  \n\\- Whisky Class Submarines  \n\n\n3) Technical Support and Military training provided by the Royal Canadian Army, British Army, and the United States Army.  \n\n\n4) HMS Hercules Class Aircraft Carrier with Hawker Sea Hawk Carrier Borne Jet Fighters.  \n\n\n5) [Establishment of the First Five Year Defense Plan in 1964 which entailed the following:-](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643691?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A36b6c66c8383091b5a601538bd26a9e7&amp;seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents)  \n\n\n\\- Increase in Army strength to 825,000 by 1965  \n\\- Increase in Air Force Strength to 45 Tactical Squadrons  \n\\- Improvements in Early Warning Air Radar Systems  \n\\- Replacement of aging Indian Navy ships  \n\\- Equipment standardization and indigenization   \n\n\n6) [Establishment of the Committee for Defense Planning and Joint Intelligence Committee under the Cabinet for centralization](https://www.idsa.in/system/files/jds_4_3_lkbehera.pdf)[ of Defense Planning and Intelligence.](https://www.idsa.in/system/files/jds_4_3_lkbehera.pdf)  \n\n\n7) Establishment of Department of Planning and Co-ordination under DRDO   \n\n\nHowever, the Indians ran into a lot of obstacles, many of them of their own making and some of them due to external complications. For instance, after Nehru rejected the expansion of American, French, and British military aid in favor of Soviet military aid, the British blocked the sale of 3 Daring Class Destroyers to India while the Americans demanded dollarized payments upfront for the purchase of F-104 Starfighter Jet Fighters and B-26 Jet Bombers. The Soviets also were keen to exploit weaknesses and steer India away from becoming a pro-US power in South Asia (which would have meant a loss of the only foothold for the USSR in South Asia) and [delayed the supply of Whisky Class Submarines and 38 MiG-21 Fighters till 1965](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643691?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A36b6c66c8383091b5a601538bd26a9e7&amp;seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents) to gain additional leverage over India.   \n\n\n[This military expansion put immense strain on the Indian Economy and slowed down growth between 1963-1967.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4370452?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A2b505c8a5d9bfec7f53ab7de88c379a5&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents)   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GDP at 1960 Prices from 1957-58 to 1972-73 ](https://preview.redd.it/5qi7qmofvqw71.png?width=443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5d2ba386946e624e3673a593841e6c2fca0805f)\n\n  \n\n\n**3) India\'s War of Attrition- the Indo Pakistan War of 1965**  \n   \nThe Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 was the most stressful war for both India and Pakistan and the bloodiest one ever fought involving massive tank battles and dogfights not witnessed since the Second World War. The war began over a [Pakistani claim on the Rann of Kutch](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/world/Pakistan/Paks-intrusions-on-borders-triggered-1965-war-Durrani/articleshow/5009969.cms) area which led to [Pakistani Border Patrol intrusions in January 1965 followed by Indian counter-patrols in the region, which led to a clash between Indian and Pakistani forces](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) and became a *casus belli* for the Pakistanis to declare war. Pakistani PM Ayub Khan had grossly under-estimated India\'s military might thinking that it had not recovered from the beating it had received in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and green-lit the major infiltration effort organized by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistani Special Forces into Kashmir, codenamed ["Operation Gibraltar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gibraltar). However, the Pakistani infiltrators did not get a warm reception as expected and the Indian Army was alerted and resulted in a major operational failure.  \n\n\nThe war would commence on August 5th, 1965, [when 30,000 Pakistani Army regulars would cross the Line of Control into the Indian side](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1965.htm) disguised as local shepherds but were discovered by the Indian Army border patrols and the Indian Army itself launched a major incursion into Gilgit Baltistan (PoK). By August 8th, Pakistan had captured Tithwal, Uri, and Poonch while India had captured Haji Pir Pass in PoK. The Pakistani Army responded with Operation Grand Slam, intending to capture Akhnoor in Jammu and completely cut off all Indian troops in J&amp;K from their supply routes. The invasion began at 0330 Hours, IST on 1st September 1965 with a 300 gun artillery barrage as thousands of Pakistani Mechanized and Armored units poured into Indian J&amp;K, overwhelming whatever token resistance the unprepared Indian troops offered, forcing the Indian Air Force to respond which brought in the Pakistani Air Force. Eventually the battle lost steam as Indian resistance stiffened more faster than the Pakistanis expected, moreover, [the Indians began their own invasion in the Thar Desert Region, placing Lahore and Islamabad under direct threat.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_3632000/3632092.stm) The Indians engaged the Pakistani Army in fierce combat: [The Battle of Burki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Burki) which was the first major tank clash with the [Pakistanis losing 84 Main Battle Tanks vs. India\'s 4](http://sainiksamachar.nic.in/englisharchives/2009/jan15-09/h61.html). This put the Indian Army within striking distance of Lahore International Airport. The Indian Army continued its thrust with the 3 Jat Rifles Regiment and the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade [capturing Dograi on the outskirts of Lahore in a fierce battle.](http://sainiksamachar.nic.in/englisharchives/2015/oct01-15/h5.htm)   \n\n\nHowever, all was not flowers and gifts for the Indian Army- the town of Munabo- just 250 km away from Jodhpur fell after a company of 5 Maratha Rifles was overrun in a 12 hour battle with the Pakistani 1st Armored Division. This would be followed up by the [infamous Battle of Chaiwinda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chawinda), the largest tank battle fought after WW2 involving 500+ tanks (232 Pakistani and 360 Indian) as the Pakistani 1st Armored Division clashed with the Indian 1st Armored Division and inflicting major casualties on the Indian tanks, forcing the Indians to withdraw and putting the Sialkot-Amritsar axis under direct threat. The Indians were pushed all the way to Khem Karan, just 100 km away from Amritsar, where they would make their last stand in what would become the [Battle of Assal Uttar](https://medium.com/the-national-identity/the-national-identity-viii-the-battle-of-asal-uttar-and-the-legacy-of-the-65-war-1e75eaa39121) as the Pakistani Army went against their own conventional armor doctrine and split their tanks into piecemeal formations while the Indian Army concentrated all their remaining tanks and artillery in an "all or nothing" defensive posture. The Indians would inflict a humiliating defeat on the Pakistani 1st Armor Division, knocking out 100+ tanks and capturing another 48 tanks, and ending the threat to Amritsar (off note here, but many people in the Defense establishment do not realize how close India had come to capitulating here if the Indian defense had been broken decisively and the Pakistanis managed to cross the Beas River into Punjab, there was no combat formation available as all reserves had been committed to the war already and the Pakistani Army would have advanced into Delhi within 24 hours without any resistance)   \n\n\nThe war would in a stalemate with tens of thousands of casualties- the bloodiest conflict fought in Asia post-Korean War. [The UNSC passed Resolution 211](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/IN%20PK_650920_Security%20Council%20Resolution%20211%20%281965%29.pdf) demanding that India and Pakistan declare a ceasefire and return to the pre-war positions. The war although a stalemate ended with India holding the upper hand in terms of casualties inflicted, landmass held, and available resources.  \n\n\nWhile this war was being fought, a new center of trouble was developing within India itself- the CPI-M radicals in the Naxalbari region were protesting against landlords and called for radical land reform, led by ultra-radical Marxists [Charu Majumandar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charu_Majumdar) (who called for a People\'s War against India), [Kanu Sanyal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanu_Sanyal), and [Jangal Santhal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangal_Santhal) (leader of the  Siliguri Kishan Sabha) initiated politically motivated violence against landlords in the Naxalbari and Siliguri regions. The movement would find sympathies with the workers who were kept under Feudal-era serf-like conditions by their landlords and would eventually gather steam, alarming the CPI (ML) wing of the West Bengal Government. Whether this political violence can be contained is to be seen.......  \n\n\nThat\'s all for this part, in the next part I will cover post-1965 reforms, the 1971 Indo-Pak War, and the Military-Babu Complex of India. Once again, Suggestions, Challenges, and Doubts are more than welcome.   \n\n\n**For Other Parts:**\n\n[Part I: Post-Independence Reforms and the Sino-Indian War (1947-1962)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qiybsf/indian_military_strategy_history_2018_land/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)'<br />Author: 'Plutonian990'  id: 'qjlv2u'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qjlv2u/indian_military_strategy_history_land_warfare/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'How Zohra Segal, 48-year-old mother of two, reinvented herself in London | Biography Excerpt'<br />Body: '*Edited excerpts from biography,* ***Zohra! A Biography in Four Acts*** *by Ritu Menon, reveal how the actor and dancer bounced back from her husband Kameshwar Segal‚Äôs death.*\n\nKameshwar died in 1959, Prithvi Theatres closed down, and Zohra stopped acting. For three years she lived in a kind of suspended animation, bereft of all the resources, relationships and activities that had sustained her. Kameshwar‚Äôs death, the more or less simultaneous closure of Prithvi Theatres and Uzra‚Äôs final departure for Pakistan marked the kind of turning point in her life from which there would be no going back.\n\nA subtle transformation was taking place within her ‚Äì she realised that the only skills she had were dancing and acting, and that, thus far, she had simply, and conveniently, attached herself first to one celebrated artiste and then another, ‚Äòbasking in their glory‚Äô. She was on her own now, single, the sole breadwinner, not just for the time being but for the foreseeable future. And she was forty-eight years old, with two very young children to look after. A stock-taking was necessary.\n\n**England beckons**\n\nThere was nothing impulsive about her decision to seek work as an actor in England, just a practical reckoning that any experience gained on the London stage ‚Äì should it come her way ‚Äì could only be to her advantage. She needed to work as an actor, but also to earn a living, and so she arrived at the second critical decision in her current situation: she would take whatever she was offered with regard to both. She would suppress her ego as an actor; and as an individual, relegate her aristocratic lineage to the background.\n\nShe would, in a manner of speaking, make herself over. Acquire a persona. Present another face to the world. A dresser at the Old Vic, a glorified ayah? Why not? No one knew who she was in London and, looking on the bright side, she could see as many plays as she liked at the Old Vic. A seamstress at Pettits? A new skill. Managress at the Tea Centre? The better to entertain her friends and co-workers at the BBC with. Waiting for her luck to turn, recalling, at every low point, Kameshwar‚Äôs adage: ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt mind, it doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äô\n\nIn the beginning all her roles were fillers, her screen presence often no longer than a few minutes. Producers would send their scripts to agents with a breakdown of the characters, and if the agents had clients who seemed to fit the roles they would send their details on and hope they were called for an interview. ‚ÄòWith Zohra, people came to us because they wanted Zohra,‚Äô said Jill Williams, ‚Äòand I don‚Äôt remember her ever turning down a job.‚Äô\n\nZohra told Roshan Seth, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm more than fully aware of my shortcomings.‚Äô But she persevered. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt,‚Äô said Roshan. ‚ÄòI gave up, returned to India, she didn‚Äôt.‚Äô\n\nMadhur Jaffrey, too, gave up her acting career for want of good roles and developed as a TV personality, focussing on food. Rani Dube moved into production, Jamila Massey slowly branched out into writing, and Indira Joshi retired early. Zohra waited. Used her voice initially to good advantage on BBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòEnglish by Radio‚Äô, ‚ÄòLook, Listen, Speak‚Äô and ‚ÄòMake Yourself at Home.‚Äô She accepted bit parts whenever an offer came her way, made herself available, kept her body in trim.\n\nHer mantra:\n\n&gt;Eat a good diet.\n\n&gt;Do all things in moderation.\n\n&gt;Exercise every morning.\n\n&gt;Keep happy.\n\nThe roles she got were like that of the Ayah in the Kipling series ‚Äì and that, too (as she told her cousin Muneeza Shamsie), ‚Äòbecause Waris Hussein stood by me‚Äô ‚Äì but she didn‚Äôt discriminate (unlike other Indian actors in London at the time) because, as Roshan Seth said, ‚Äòto discriminate was a luxury, and she didn‚Äôt have that. She never turned anything down ‚Äì she needed the money, she needed the work, she needed to be seen‚Äô.\n\nShe needed to be seen, and to be seen by as many people as possible, for which television was the perfect medium. She loved theatre, believed that the best training for an actor is the stage, and always maintained that ‚Äò[the] stage is like a sari, the TV screen like a rumaal. You can make a rumaal out of a sari, but not the other way around.‚Äô But she also knew that television was far more likely to have an opening for her than the West End, and also likely to be much better paid.\n\nThrough the hard times that continued for several years and gave little indication that they would end soon, or for long, Zohra never looked back or retraced her steps. ‚ÄòIt was a kind of one-way street,‚Äô recalled her nephew Babar, ‚Äòbecause she had burnt her bridges. She never dwelt on her adversity.‚Äô\n\nIndeed, adversity, it almost seemed, brought out the best in her. Although she herself thought she was bad-tempered, selfish and impatient, no one (other than her children, obviously) ever recalled her being so, on any occasion. The Zohra they saw, knew and worked with was never disparaging or judgemental, was always game ‚Äì ‚Äòcreatively lovable‚Äô, in Dolly Thakore‚Äôs words, and ‚Äòlife-enhancing‚Äô, in Jill Williams‚Äô opinion. In England, in a social environment that was never completely home to her, working in a field characterised by competitiveness, rivalry and professional jealousies, a field, moreover, where a subtle racism was never far from the surface, Zohra developed the habit of stiff-upper-lip-with-a-smile.\n\nWith rare exceptions ‚Äì Jewel in the Crown, Firm Friends, her early films ‚Äì Zohra was cast as what Jill Williams called the ‚Äòfunny granny‚Äô, and it was a role she made her own. In a way, a nani‚Äôs or dadi‚Äôs personality and place in Indian families almost comes ready-made; what Zohra did was to give it an added twist: she improvised. Often, dialogues were bland or boring or in broken English, and roles could be skimpy. She made something of them, regardless, even if it was only to add gibberish Bambaiyya lingo to the twinkle in her eye.\n\nThat Zohra had undeniable stage and screen presence was a fact, but was she actor or performer? Was she playing a role, or playing Zohra? Onstage or off, on screen or not, wasn‚Äôt she always just playing a part, and hadn‚Äôt she always said, ‚ÄòWhatever I do is for an audience‚Äô? Did she actually ever stop acting?\n\nShe loved being complimented, loved the applause, never tired of enquiring about her performance: ‚ÄòDid you really like it? I was good, wasn‚Äôt I?‚Äô But she could also overdo it, become a caricature of herself. ‚ÄòIf she had been directed properly,‚Äô commented Roshan Seth, ‚Äòher performances would probably have been very different.‚Äô So, why wasn‚Äôt she? ‚ÄòBecause of her age, because of who she was, because she was SO sincere, SO honest, SO truthful‚Ä¶ Nobody told her, ‚ÄòTry not to try.‚Äô\n\nSeth believed it was her early exposure in the Prithviraj mode of acting that was responsible for many of her over-the-top performances, that when ‚Äòyou are not given the tools to do the job, you think excess energy will do it for you‚Äô. Yet it was the same Roshan Seth who also believed that ‚Äòthere was something in Zohra of Mother Courage, taking the ploughshares on her shoulders, something in her of the tigress‚Äô.\n\n[Source](https://scroll.in/reel/1003630/how-zohra-segal-48-year-old-mother-of-two-reinvented-herself-in-london)'<br />Author: 'koach-BC-universe'  id: 'qjjmzs'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qjjmzs/how_zohra_segal_48yearold_mother_of_two/</li>

The feeling was there but was unable to put it in words, this sums it up. Was listening to a few Sai Deepak lectures where he referred to the issue about how the judiciary\'s interpretation of constitution exclusively pushes for secularisation of culture religion and sentiments of only a particular majority. While the perceived minorities have a free hand in management of their own religio social issues. In doing so, the majority is allowed to believe that it\'s a privilege/permission provided by constitution for them to be allowed to practice their beliefs within the confines of constitution and with oversight of government, while the minorities have the "right" to do so. This effectively dilutes their belief system in their unique identity and instead constitution replaces it, not even in public life ( which is the right thing) but also their personal one (which is problematic). This is not the case with the other side who are allowed to have a parallel system coexisting with country\'s law ( absolutely fine when dealing with just their community specific issues, but shouldn\'t be valid in questions involving others). Eventually there will come a time when the majority will believe that their identity was a "myth" , stories and fictional tales.\n Now my understanding of Sai\'s exact words can be a little off with a few additions of my own, but gist is same.'<br />Author: 'anshulruhil09'  id: 'qjijlo'<br />Score:41<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qjijlo/gradual_secularisation_of_hindu_mindset/</li>

The Supreme Court also ruled that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate is subjecting them to unnecessary pain and suffering, so such events were outlawed.[41][42]\n\nOn 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the tradition under certain conditions, effectively ending the ban.[43][44][45] However, on 14 January 2016, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on this order, upholding the ban, after a petition filed by the Animal Welfare Board of India and PETA India, leading to protests all over Tamil Nadu.[46] The Supreme Court refused to review its decision on 26 July 2016.[47]\n\nOn 16 January 2016, the World Youth Organization (WYO) protested at Chennai against the stay on the order overturning ban on conducting jallikattu in Tamil Nadu. The WYO also demanded a ban on PETA in India.[48][49]\n\nOn 8 January 2017, several hundreds of protesters conducted a rally at Chennai Marina opposing the ban on jallikattu.[50] The participants walked from the lighthouse to the labour statue bearing posters saying "save jallikattu".[51][52] A few churches openly conducted prayer mass and rally against the Supreme Court ruling.[53] Following the protests at Chennai, many students started rallies in various towns of Tamil Nadu.[7]\n\nAfter hearing the petitions which were led by the Animal Welfare Board of India challenging central government\'s notification,[54] the Supreme Court of India on 12 January ordered a stay, issued notices to the central government and the Tamil Nadu government[55][56][57] and later refused to lift the stay.[58] Numerous jallikattu events were held across Tamil Nadu in protest of the ban,[59] and hundreds of participants were detained by police in response.[60][61] The Supreme Court has agreed to delay its verdict on jallikattu for a week following the centre\'s request that doing so would avoid unrest.\n\nDue to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of jallikattu events.[62] On 23 January 2017 the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bipartisan bill, with the accession of the Prime Minister, exempting jallikattu from the Prevention of Cruelity to Animals Act (1960).[63][64] The first legal jallikattu under this exemption took place on 1 February in Alanganallur, Madurai district.[65]\n\nThe legal situation surrounding jallikattu is as yet not clearly resolved.\n\n-____________________________\n\n29 March 2006: While hearing a petition filed by K.

Jawaharlal Nehru in 1946 to present a scientific strategy for the defense of the newly formed Republic of India. [The Armed Forces had retained Field Marshall Sir Claude Auchinleck\'s, Armed Force Organisation Plan calling for 200,000 Active Duty Ground troops, a 20 squadron Air Force and a Navy centered around 2 Aircraft Carriers with](https://idsa.in/system/files/jds_5_2_gdbakshi.pdf) a primary threat coming from the Great Indian Desert Region (i.e. the post-independence state of Pakistan). [P.M.S Blackett had submitted the following recommendations to the Indian Government,](https://www.jstor.org/stable/532210):-  \n\n\n1) Maintain a small territorial defense force focusing exclusively on a Defensive Minded Strategy  \n2) Maintaining a Non Aligned posture against the Soviet Union and the United States  \n3) Military Expenditure MUST NOT exceed 2% of India\'s GDP  \n4) No need to pursue any Weapons of Mass Destruction Programme (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Weapons)  \n5) Focus Extensively on Generating economic growth by modernizing core industries, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation.  \n6) To ensure the Indian Armed Force do not get entangled in a war against a major power, extensive civilian control of the Armed Forces must be maintained in all affairs related to defense.  \n\n\nThis extremely pacifist recommendation was taken to an extreme level that pushed India\'s Defense Budget below the recommended 2% target- the Army went through a massive demobilization period in which 7 World War II era Divisions were disbanded while the Frontier Guards were divided between India and Pakistan- with Pakistan gaining 7 of the 11 Frontier Divisions, [with defense becoming an afterthought.](https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/217/1/Final_Budget_Speech_1948-49.pdf) Another issue the Indian Army faced as against other branches was the acute shortage of well-trained and educated officers and NCOs in its units while most of its Heavy Mechanized units were sapped/de-commissioned in a "Peace Dividend" move following the end of the Second World War. This move would set the stage for the First Indo-Pakistan War of 1947-48 in which a defanged Indian Army was essentially reduced to fighting a desperate rearguard action against their more numerous, well-led (mostly because of the fact that Muhammed Ali Jinnah had requested the British Colonial Government to allow their military officers to serve in Pakistani units and more aggressive Pakistani Army counterparts. In fact, the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947-48 remains the most intense war the Armed Forces, especially the Army ever fought with[ most Param Vir Chakras being awarded in this conflict](https://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmPhotoGalleryWithMenuWithTitle.aspx?MnId=EfxaYIrx5QKKweuxvLEVwg==&amp;ParentID=+TZ06yGP3OH9UhaOvAtI2Q==&amp;flag=C9dOyn8bpH2rosxB+2Ygbw==)\\- 5 out of a total of 20 awarded (20% of all Param Vir Chakras ever awarded since 1947). The Armed Forces Chiefs were also relegated to a subordinate role to the civilian government and removed from all key military advisory roles- completely centralizing decision-making authority in the Indian Government rather than the Military itself. This blunder got reinforced by the extremely restrained policy of non-aggression in which Indian tactical commanders had "zero control over their own units and supporting commands in any military region as all decisions had to be routed through the civilian government machinery in New Delhi- first through the Ministry of Defense, then the Cabinet Committee on Defense, then the National Security Advisor and finally the Prime Minister and President, of course, all of them being subject to the political tomfoolery in both Houses"- a problem that has not been sorted- and even worsened by additional complications in the chain of command, till date. This problem will be highlighted later on in this write-up.  \n\n\nAnother long-term strategic failure of this move was the fact that while the Indian Armed Forces in a real manner, was preparing for an inevitable conflict with the People\'s Republic of China- with the civilian government dangerously escalating matters geopolitically by supporting Tibetian Independence and taking Bhutan and Nepal under its wings- primarily because it wanted to use these states as a strategic tripwire against the Chinese Military power in the region which would give the Indian State ample time to reinforce its frontier along the Chinese Border. This strategy was also pushed to a new height by Defense Minister V.K. Krishna Menon ([in his Forward Policy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/651889)) who appointed China hawks in the Ministry of Defense and as key Generals in the Indian Eastern Command against China and also managed to piss off the military establishment by dismantling the old seniority-based promotion program for Officer Ranks with a Merit-based system- l[eading to a leadership crisis in 1958 when General K.S. Thimayya (Chief of Army) resigned](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2643745) \\- being replaced by [General Brij Mohan Kaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Mohan_Kaul)\\- a known China Hawk and had risen to the ranks due to the fact [that he was a "personal favorite" of the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and VK Krishna Menon](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=x6FsaptULgAC&amp;q=B.M+Kaul+nepotism&amp;pg=PA161&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=B.M%20Kaul%20nepotism&amp;f=false) (based off former President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan\'s Autobiography written in 1991 in which he showed disdain for General BM Kaul).  \n\n\nHowever, not all was bad at this time frame- the Indians had come off a high in the successful military operations: [Operation Polo (Annexation of Hyderabad)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Hyderabad) in 1948 leading to the integration of the Kingdom of Hyderabad into the Republic of India and [Operation Vijay (Annexation of Portuguese India- Goa and Daman &amp; Diu)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vijay) in 1961. But the 900-pound Elephant in the room was being ignored by the Indian Military and Civilian establishment- the People\'s Republic of China. The PRC had come off a momentous high following its civil war and subsequent intervention in the Korean War against the US-led United Nations Coalition lasting until 1953. Following the Korean War, [the People\'s Liberation Army of China started to change its peasant model popular militia army into a mechanized modern army with extensive Soviet help](https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013230/http://libweb.uoregon.edu/ec/e-asia/read/chicom.pdf)\\- modeling itself off the Soviet Armed Forces and creating a Military District style organization model- with 13 Military Districts being created. The PRC operated with the geopolitical psychology of being "at Siege" from Imperialist powers looking to undermine their nation- and Indian affairs of appointing China hawks, courting states that were "*obviously"* Chinese enclaves (South Tibet, Tibet, and Aksai Chin region), "occupying rightful Chinese clay" (Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh) and belligerent posturing along the Chinese border regions (courtesy of PM Nehru, BM Gaur, and VK Krishna Menon) only pissed off the Chinese even further- leading to the Annexation of Tibet in 1959- in which Nehru FURTHER angered China by hosting the Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetian refugees in India. [The Indian Republic and PRC were now engaged in a dangerous strategic gambit- or in non-PC terms, a game of chicken](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm) in which the person blinks first stands to lose massively, setting an extremely fluid situation along the Tibet-Kashmir-NE Frontier region as a major buildup of forces on both sides continued, [blaming each other for escalating the situation and failed talks between both nations set the stage for an inevitable clash.](https://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/china%20decision%20for%201962%20war%202003.pdf)  \n\n\n  \n**Part B: The Border Explodes: Sino-Indian War of 1962**  \n\n\n**(Prelude to the War)**  \n\n\nIn hindsight, the war was a natural reaction resulting from the tensions simmering in the region since the 1950s. Take your pick: blaming Hawkish policy frameworks especially the Forward Policy of the Ministry of Defense and not matching these commitments with increased defense spending throughout the late 1950s, the McMahon Line Dispute between India and China, [the 1957 Kongka Pass Incident in which 9 CRPF personnel were killed and another 10 were taken prisoner by the PLAGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongka_Pass#Kongka_Pass_incident) (prisoners were eventually released), [Chinese territorial claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute), unnecessary escalation of tensions by both sides, [the naive thinking on part of Pt.

This will be done with a view to establishing additional posts located to prevent the Chinese from advancing further and also to dominate any Chinese posts already established in our territory."*  \n\n\nSuch belligerent statements were nothing new by now. For example, in 1962, [the Ministry of Home Affairs had made the following statement:-](https://web.archive.org/web/20111111000325/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm)  \n\n\n*"If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by her, India will have to repeat* *what she did in Goa**. She will certainly drive out the Chinese forces."*   \n\n\nThe major blunder made here was that the Indian Defense Establishment had grossly underestimated the readiness rates of the PLA along the North East Frontier and over-estimated its own readiness rate, thanks to excessive corruption and bureaucratic delays in the reporting of information all the way up to the chain of command in New Delhi. [The next blunder was to not allow the Indian Air Force to conduct any sorties in support of ground forces](https://www.idsa.in/strategicanalysis/The1962IndiaChinaWarandKargil1999_rsukumaran_0703)\\- CAS or Battlefield Superiority missions were not allowed and the Air Force had been strictly relegated to an Airspace Defense and Regional Interdiction role for "not escalating the situation" (ironically)- the primary fear being that the PLAAF would have retaliated by bombarding Indian population centers- especially New Delhi.   \n\n\n**(The "Battle" of Chusul, 1962)**  \n\n\nBy July 1962, the situation had heated up to a point where the figurative pressure cooker was ready to explode, with Indian forces getting the green light to aggressively push back any Chinese incursions into Indian territory. This situation led to the ugly escalation in the [Battle of Chushul on July 7, 1962,](https://web.archive.org/web/20010209084245/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-3/lns.html) in which a company of the J&amp;K Rifles along with 1/8th Gorkhas and 5th Jat Rifle Battalion were surrounded by a force of nearly 350 Chinese troops in their own posts and a screaming match ensured that also involved the use of loudspeakers. Such harassing attacks would continue for the next 3 days until the Chinese gave up on provoking the Indians to open fire and spark an incident that could be used as a pretext for war and withdrew.  \n\n\nThe situation had attracted the attention of major Great powers- the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. All 3 nations engaged both sides in a series of talks in order to de-escalate the situation along the entire border region. Predictably, all these talks failed as they had no effect on the simmering tensions with each side refusing to acknowledge the problems or back down from the dangerous situation they had created.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(**The Cuban Missile Crisis and its impact on the Cross Border tensions)**  \n\n\nAs if to highlight the cross border situation in a sick twist of fate, [the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in their own geopolitical game of chicken in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis) when the Central Intelligence Agency had notified the US Government that the Soviet Union was basing off Nuclear Tipped R-12 and R-14 Medium Ranged Ballistic Missiles (MRBMs) in Communist Cuba as a matching move to the Americans basing Jupiter MRBMs in Italy and Turkey. The crisis had distracted both the superpowers from the rapidly deteriorating situation at the Sino-Indian border. The Soviets in an effort to shrug off minor incidents so that it could focus on the Americans more, decided to greenlight the Chinese offensive when [Premier Mao obtained guarantees that the USSR would not intervene on behalf of the Indians](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/ghosts-of-black-november/), and the Americans along with the rest of NATO were pre-occupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis leaving India fluttering alone in the wind at a high spot from which it could not back down.   \n\n\n**(The Intent of the Chinese and Indians)**  \n\n\nFor China, [a series of declassified CIA reports in 2006](https://wayback.archive-it.org/924/20150627204033/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/14/polo-07.pdf) highlighted the intent of the Chinese going to war with India:-\n\n  \n1) The Chinese were terrified of being encircled by American and Soviet client states from all sides. the Chinese were acutely aware of American forces in the Pacific, Korean Peninsula &amp; SE Asia, British Forces in SE Asia, the USSR with its Indian client state, and the Russian Far East would form a steel ring that would choke the Chinese to death.  \n2) The Chinese wanted to reverse the British gains of the McMahon Line and return Arunanchal Pradesh, Sikkim, parts of Uttarakhand &amp; Himachal Pradesh, and the Aksai Chin region "back to rightful Chinese ownership".  \n3) To punish India by showing it as a belligerent and hostile communist power that was not worthy of trust and to widen the Sino-Soviet Split in favor of the Chinese.  \n4) To reverse the "territorial gains" of the Indians under their belligerent "Forward Policy" by utilizing Salami-slicing tactics of territorial expansion.  \n\n\n  \nFor India:  \n\n\n\\- Maintain the status quo in the region by reaffirming the McMahon Line and the subsequent territories via Forward Policy  \n\\- Maintain a Defensive posture in line with the PMS Blackett Strategy along the entire frontier  \n\\- Mobilising sufficient forces in the region to prevent future Chinese incursions.  \n\n\n**(The Thag La Incident)**  \n\n\nIn June 1962, Indian troops occupied the Dhola Post in the Thag La Ridge which actually lay North of the *actual* McMahon Line but South of the Indian interpretation of the McMahon Line. The Chinese issued diplomatic protests and eventually began their own counter-deployments on top of the Thag La range. On 8 September, a 60-strong PLA unit descended to the south side of the ridge and occupied positions that dominated one of the Indian posts at Namka Chu. Fire was not exchanged, but Nehru told the media that the Indian Army had instructions to *"free our territory*" and the troops had been given the discretion to use force. On September 11th, 1962, all Indian forces were given the order to fire at will on any Chinese incursions into Indian territory. The entire operation was a bust due to unclear policy directives from New Delhi and the fact that the Indian troops had to carry all their equipment ALONG with their heavy equipment at an altitude of 16000+ feet. [On September 16th, 1962, the first skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops occurred when](https://web.archive.org/web/20020810075442/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1962War/Namka.html) PLA troops threw hand grenades on the Indians and a subsequent firefight started across the entire front, with the Indians losing the Dhola Post.  \n\n\nThis incident had disillusioned many Indian soldiers and tactical commanders, including Brigadier General John Parushuman Dalvi (who would be captured during the war) voicing their criticism on occupying the Dhola Post in the first place, with the same doubts being shared by many senior officials in the Ministry of Defense.   \n\n\nOn 10 October 1962, an Indian Rajput Rifles patrol of 50 troops to Yumtso La was met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers. Indian troops were in no position for battle, as Yumtso La was more than 16,000 feet above sea level and Kaul did not plan on having artillery support for the troops. The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians under their belief that they were north of the McMahon Line. The Indians were surrounded by Chinese positions which used mortar fire. They managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties.  At this point, the Indian troops were in a position to push the Chinese back with mortar and machine gunfire. Brigadier Dalvi opted not to fire, as it would mean decimating the Rajput who were still in the area of the Chinese regrouping. Frustrated, the Indians helplessly watched the Chinese ready themselves for a second assault. In the second Chinese assault, the Indians began their retreat, realizing the situation was hopeless. By the time the dust settled, the Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties and the Chinese 33.  This attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October, it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack, with a massive troop buildup. A long line of mules and porters had also been observed supporting the buildup and reinforcement of positions south of the Thag La Ridge \n\n  \n\n\n**(War Erupts Across the Frontier)**  \n\n\nOn October 20th, 1962, the People\'s Liberation Army of China ignited the Sino-Indian war by attacking along a 1000 kilometer front in both the North and North East. On the Western Theater (Kashmir), the PLA sought to expel Indian forces from the Chip Chap valley in Aksai Chin while in the eastern theatre, the PLA sought to capture both banks of the Namka Chu river while in the East, the Chinese aimed to force the Indians off the Thag La Ridge completely and out of the mountains in the Arunanchal Pradesh region. The PLA would execute night infiltration attacks on isolated Indian battalions and companies while utilizing mortars and heavy artillery to their fullest extent and being the masters in Guerilla warfare (courtesy of 30+ years of combat experience against the Chinese Nationalists, the Japanese in the Second Sino Japanese War and the Americans in the Korean War), the Chinese would cut down Indian troops with ease. However, the war was not one-sided as the Indian Army would put up extremely tenacious resistance even in the face of overwhelming odds- for example, in the [Battle of Walong (18th October-16th November 1962)](https://web.archive.org/web/20020615032009/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1962War/Walong.html), the 6th Kumaon Regiment put up tenacious resistance despite repeated PLA attacks with Indian mortars and machine-gun fire cutting down PLA troops and holding their position for 4 hours before retreating and leaving a company back for rear-guard action.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Progress of the Sino-Indian War in Kashmir with corroborating claims of both sides\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yocs7dq80kw71.png?width=450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c1aa78348ded48263332aff3bc53df52a02a9e3)\n\nEventually, even with the full-spirited defense of the Indian Army, the Chinese were able to push them out of the Aksai Chin region and even gain more territory than the original Chinese territorial claims. The Indian side was fighting without Air or Artillery support as I had mentioned before- Centralisation and Micro-management of the war from New Delhi doomed the Indian defense effort. The Indian Air Force was not allowed to fly combat sorties in support of the Indian defenders on the ground while artillery support was withheld up to a time frame of 24 hours- at a time where every minute proved critical, the artillery support was withheld because the civilian government had not decided whether firing heavy artillery would escalate the war or not (again, ironic). By 22nd October 1962, the Chinese had entered 16.4 kilometers deep South of the original McMahon Line across the entire front in Kashmir and started fortifying their positions. Meanwhile, [the PRC decided to negotiate from a position of strength and offered to end the war with the following demands](https://web.stanford.edu/group/tomzgroup/pmwiki/uploads/2094-1962-12-KS-a-JHS.pdf):-  \n\n\n1. A negotiated settlement of the boundary\n2. That both sides disengage and withdraw 20 kilometers (12\xa0mi) from present lines of actual control\n3. A Chinese withdrawal north in NEFA\n4. That China and India do not cross lines of present control in Aksai Chin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot daring to lose any Indian territory with the upcoming general elections and the loss of face for Nehru and the Indian National Congress, Nehru on 27th October 1962 responded with the request that:-  \n\n\n*"Restoration of peace and friendly relations and suggested a return to the boundary prior to 8 September 1962. He was categorically concerned about a mutual 20 kilometers withdrawal after 40 or 60 kilometers of blatant military aggression". He wanted the creation of a larger immediate buffer zone and thus resist the possibility of a repeat offense."*  \n\n\nPremier Zhou re-affirmed his original claims presented in the letter before. Facing Chinese forces maintaining themselves on Indian soil and trying to avoid political pressure, the Indian parliament announced a national emergency and passed a resolution that stated their intent to "drive out the aggressors from the sacred soil of India" and issued a general mobilization. The war continued on 14th November 1962, with the Chinese cutting off 10,000 troops of the Indian 4th "Red Eagle" Infantry Division near Se La and Bomdi La and cutting off the supply route of the Indian troops by occupying Thembang. On the Western Front, the PLA advanced and engaged Indian troops in the [Battle of Chushul](https://web.archive.org/web/20010209084245/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE3-3/lns.html) in which Indian forces were hit relentlessly with waves of PLA troops and holding their position. On Rezang La, the situation had turned desperate as the 123 troops were hit by Chinese mortars, heavy artillery, and machine-gun fire from the heights. This was also the place where Major Shaitan Singh would make his last stand against hopeless odds- engaging nearly 900 PLA troops with a Bren LMG for 4 hours before being killed, buying vital time for the remnants of the 114th Infantry Brigade to withdraw to the next defensive line- Major Shaitan Singh would be awarded the Param Vir Chakra Posthumously for his actions.   \n\n\nBy 19th November 1962, the PLA had achieved all of its objectives and declared a front wide ceasefire.  \n\n[Premier Zhou Enlai declared a unilateral ceasefire to start on midnight,](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/175946.pdf?v=404219d0404b58d9d0eb299c55521da9) 21 November. Zhou\'s ceasefire declaration stated:- \n\n*"Beginning from 21 November 1962, the Chinese frontier guards will ceasefire along the entire Sino-Indian border. Beginning from 1 December 1962, the Chinese frontier guards will withdraw to positions 20 kilometers behind the line of actual control which existed between China and India on 7 November 1959. In the eastern sector, although the Chinese frontier guards have so far been fighting on Chinese territory north of the traditional customary line, they are prepared to withdraw from their present positions to the north of the illegal McMahon Line and to withdraw twenty kilometers back from that line. In the middle and western sectors, the Chinese frontier guards will withdraw twenty kilometers from the line of actual control."*  \n\n\nThe Chinese had inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Indian Army but taking a punishment off its own, losses on both sides totaled in the thousands in under a month of intensive fighting.  \n\n\nTo highlight the strategic failure and the chaos that followed, Pt. Nehru\'s correspondence letters with US President John F Kennedy highlight the increasingly desperate situation which was highlighted by the tone of each letter  \n\n\n  \n[Excerpts from Letter One:](https://historyinpieces.com/documents/documents/nehru-letter-jfk-sino-indian-war-1/)  \n \n\nNew Delhi  \n19th November 1962\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nIt is now a month since the Chinese massive attack on India started on 20th October. I think I must write to you again to acquaint you with further developments that have occurred since my letter of 29th October. Before I deal with these further developments I would like to say that we are extremely grateful to you and the Government and people of the United States of America for the practical support given to us. We particularly appreciate the speed with which the urgently needed small arms and ammunition were rushed to India.\n\nThere was a deceptive lull after the first Chinese offensive during which the Chinese mounted a serious propaganda offensive in the name of peace to get us to accept their so-called three-point proposals which, shorn of their wrappings, actually constituted a demand for surrender on their terms. The Chinese tried, despite our rejection of these proposals to get various Afro-Asian countries to intercede with varying offers of mediation.\n\nAfter my clear and categorical statement in Parliament on 14th November rejecting the three-point proposal of Chou En-Lai, the Chinese who had made full preparations to put further military pressure on us restarted their military offensive. I am asking our Ambassador to give you a copy of a statement on the developments in the military situation during the last few days which I made in the Parliament this morning. Bomdila which was the Headquarters of our North-East Frontier Agency Command has been surrounded and the equivalent of two divisions engaged in the operations in the N.E.F.A. area are fighting difficult rearguard actions. It is not quite certain how many of them will be able to extricate themselves and Join the Corps Headquarters at Tezpur further south.\n\nThe Chinese are by and large in possession of the greater portion of the North-East Frontier Agency and are poised to overrun Chushul in Ladakh. There is nothing to stop them after Chushul till they reach Leh, the Headquarters of the Ladakh province of Kashmir.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Excerpt from Letter Two:](https://historyinpieces.com/documents/documents/nehru-letter-jfk-sino-indian-war-2/)\n\n \n\n*New Delhi*  \n*19th November 1962*\n\n*Dear Mr. President,*\n\n*Within a few hours of despatching my earlier message of today, the situation in the N.E.F.A. Command has deteriorated still further. Bomdila has fallen and the retreating forces from Sela have been trapped between the Sala Ridge and Bomdila. A serious threat has developed to our Digboi oil fields in Assam. With the advance of the Chinese in massive strength, the entire Brahmaputra Valley is seriously threatened, and unless something is done immediately to stem the tide the whole of Assam, Tripura, Manipur, and Nagaland would also pass into Chinese hands.*\n\n*The Chinese have poised massive forces in the Chumbi Valley between Sikkim and Bhutan and another invasion from that direction appears imminent. Our areas further North won\'t be on the border with Tibet in the States of U.P., Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh are also threatened. In Ladakh, as I have said in my earlier communication, Chushul is under heavy attack, and shelling of the airfield at Chushul has already commenced. We have also noticed increasing air activity by the Chinese air force in Tibet.*\n\n*Hitherto we have restricted our requests for assistance to essential equipment and we are most grateful for the assistance which has been so readily given to us. We did not oak for more comprehensive assistance particularly air assistance because of the wider implications of such assistance in the global context and we did not want to embarrass our friends.*\n\n*The situation that has developed is, however, really desperate. We have to have more comprehensive assistance if the Chinese are to be prevented from taking over the whole of Eastern India. Any delay in this assistance reaching us will result in nothing short of a catastrophe for our country.*\n\n*We have repeatedly felt the need of using air-arm in support of our land forces, but have been unable to do as in the present state of our air and radar equipment we have no defense age fret retaliatory action by the Chinese.*\n\n*I, therefore, request that immediate support be given to strengthening our air arm sufficiently to stem the tide of a Chinese advance.*\n\n*I am advised that for providing adequate air defense a minimum of 12 squadrons or supersonic all-weather fighters are essential. We have no modern radar cover in the country. For this also we seek your assistance. Our needs are almost immediate. The United States Air Force personnel will have to man these fighters and radar installations while our personnel is being trained. U.S. fighters and transport planes manned by U.S. personnel will be used for the present to protect our cities and installations from Chinese air attacks and to maintain our communications. We should if this is possible also like U.S. planes manned by U.S. personnel to assist the Indian Air Force in air battles with the Chinese air force over Indian areas where air action by the I.A.F. against Chinese communication lines supplies and troop concentration may lead to counter air action by the Chinese.*\n\n*Any air action to be taken against the Chinese beyond the limits of our country, e.g, Tibet, will be taken by I.A.F. planes manned by Indian personnel.*\n\nThe Sino-Indian War remains a major shakeup for the entire Indian Defense establishment as it represented a failure of the PMS Blackett\'s Strategy of Territorial Defense as depleted forces with no battle plans and independence of the three branches (in this case the Air Force and the Army) along with a hawkish strategy led to total disaster and led to a major purge in the Indian Government as PM Nehru, Defense Minister Krishna Menon and Chief of Staff BM Gaur were forced to resign with the war still breeding deep resentment in the minds of Indians till date. The post-war Henderson Brooks report was constituted in 1963 highlighting what went wrong and due to the sensitivity of the report, remains classified till today (partial de-classification was done by an Australian Journalist Neville Maxwell in 2014, leading to his book *India\'s China War)*  \n\n\nThat\'s all for this post, in the next part I will discuss the Post \'62 reforms, the Indo Pak Wars of 1965 and 1971 along with the Sundarji Doctrine and emergence of RAPID units.

I recognise that the spiritual aspect of human beings is a real thing and we do need to believe (at least most of us find solace in believing) in a higher power to make sense of our existence and why we do what we do. But it's obviously man-made, the same God would not go whisper different versions of Himself to different prophets. Or I could say different religions are just different interpretations of the same power, by man himself. And similar to our gender, physical appearance and genetic structure, all of us are just handed over the religion followed by our ancestors, at birth. \n\nI cannot deny that mankind has used religion to commit heinous acts of inhumanity over the centuries. But isn't that what we should all unitedly stand against? I have been born into Islam myself, and I honestly hate how influencial mullas have misused our religion, mainly feeding this false sense of superiority and successfully misinforming impressionable minds(read dumbfucks) to literally sell their soul in the name of God by committing acts of terrorism. But that is the fault of assholes who use religion as a medium of gathering an army for their own disposal, and not the religion itself. Islam is beautiful, it is an extremely powerful religion that teaches you to find peace within yourself by submitting to a higher power. And that is all that religion should be, an extremely personal thing, only to be applied internally not externally. \n\nGetting to my main point, apologies for the delay, this vicious circle that is being created by labelling religion along with political issues just feeds into apprehensions (in Hindus) and feelings of animosity (in Muslims) or even vice versa depending on the news we are fed. How are we to break this circle, if we don't realise that we humans are more than our religious beliefs, that separate cognizance of an incident without prejudice against gender, religion, caste or financial status is required to truly understand the right course of action, that using hate to fuel more hate will do no one any good? Or am I just being delusional by actually thinking that you and me can live harmoniously, simply because we choose to."<br />Author: 'Mr-iousMan'  id: 'qiwt6x'<br />Score:50<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qiwt6x/is_religious_harmony_a_myth/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Unpopular opinion: Hindus don't know anything about Sikhs"<br />Body: 'Hindu\'s think Sikhs are a offshoot of Hinduism, and many of them go to the Gurdwara regularly. I find this hilarious, because they go to the Gurdwara while Gurbani is being sung, and most often it is critical of Hinduism and Hindu\'s. \n\nThen they bow to Guru Granth Sahib Ji, in which Baba Nanak and the subsequent Guru\'s heavily criticized and rejected Hinduism. \n\nThey hear the words "Raam, Brahman, Har" and don\'t realize it\'s in criticism of the Hindu ideas, and instead think: "wow the Guru\'s praised Raam" etc. \n\nI\'ve heard Hindu\'s both right wing and left wing make outrageous claims like: "Baba Nanak was a Hindu because he was born a Hindu", "Baba Nanak created Sikhs to fight for Hindu\'s",  "The Guru\'s believed in the Vedas", and my favorite "Ek Om Kar is the same as Om" üòÇ \n\nRespectively, Baba Nanak said he rejected the Hindu faith and went so far as to say "The Hindu\'s are lost and blind, they are the blindest of all the blind. The fools worship rocks as Naraad instructed" Pg 556, Guru Granrh Sahib Ji. Sikhs didn\'t become warriors until the 6th Guru and it wasn\'t to protect Hindu\'s, it was in retaliation of the 5th Guru being martyred. Furthermore, Guru Gobind Singh Ji fought more wars against Hindu Rajahs then against the Mughals. The Guru\'s openly condemned the Veda\'s, called them made up fairytale\'s and said Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv were fools who couldn\'t find enlightenment. Lastly, the word "Om" is first found in the Upanishad meaning "Mystical Sound"; "Ek Oan Kar" means their is only one truth. \n\nSo why? Why do Hindu\'s keep themselves in delusion by choice? Why do they keep trying to assimilate Sikhs? \n\nI will quote more of the Guru\'s below to reinforce my claims. (Before if anyone tries to brush this off as translation errors, I urge you to go to your local Gurdwara and read and search for yourself): \n\n"The Vedas and the Scriptures are only make-believe, O Siblings of Destiny; they do not relieve the anxiety of the heart. (Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Ang 727)" \n\n"Vedas, Shastras, Simritis all say many things but I do not accept anyone of those. (Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh Ji)" \n\n"The Hindu is sightless; the Muslim has only one eye. The spiritual teacher is wiser than both of them." (Ang 875)" \n"\nIf the Lord Allah lives only in the mosque, then to whom does the rest of the world belong? According to the Hindus, the Lord\'s Name abides in the idol, but there is no truth in either of these claims. ||1|| (Ang 1349)\n\n\n"I do not accept Ganesha as important. I do not meditate on Krishna, neither on Vishnu. I do not hear them and do not recognize them. My love is with the Lotus feet of God. He is my protector, the Supreme Lord. I am dust of his Lotus feet." (Guru Gobind Singh)"\n\n"The Vedas do not know His greatness. Brahma does not know His mystery‚Ä¶. Shiva does not know His mystery. The gods have grown weary of searching for Him. (Ang 894)"\n\n"Through Brahma, the hymns of the Vedas were revealed, but the love of Maya spread. The wise one, Shiva, remains absorbed in himself, but he is engrossed in dark passions and excessive egotism. ||2|| Vishnu is always busy reincarnating himself - who will save the world? The Gurmukhs are imbued with spiritual wisdom in this age; they are rid of the darkness of emotional attachment. ||3|| (Ang 559)"'<br />Author: 'moooosicman'  id: 'qitq6k'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qitq6k/unpopular_opinion_hindus_dont_know_anything_about/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The civilizational narrative'<br />Body: "Outsiders know nothing of India's civilizational tussle of a millennia with violent Islam (not the peaceful Indianized Islam which came to India at the time of the Prophet, nor the mystic Islam of science and reason which was compatible with Indian traditions, but the free will denying, logic defying murdering cult that came in with the Turkic + Mongol invasions).\n\nThe Pakistani state is built on hatred of India - i.e. they don't have a reason to exist without an opposition to India. The opposition is not just religious, but their civilizational ideology.\n\nUnderstand this, and you will never argue that giving away Kashmir will solve anything. Giving them Pakistan did not make them happy, why will Kashmir? The goal is to occupy all of India, physically and culturally.\n\nPakistan thinks like a colonizer, India thinks like someone who doesn't want to be colonized. The colonizer is the natural aggressor. Anyone who sides with Pakistan while in India is guilty of treason against not just the state but against the civilization. India and Pakistan are not any two countries, but two civilizations that have been at war for a thousand years.\n\nThis goes all the way back to the nomadic warrior roots of the Muslim invaders, and the settled civilization roots of India. India is a settled civilization that wants to develop in science, arts, culture, business etc. with much to lose in an invasion, and the invaders on horseback living out of tents with nothing to lose want to steal the civilization.\n\nWhen the Mughals entered India they were savages on horseback possessing little knowledge of running an empire, let alone architecture - in a hundred years they had built the Taj Mahal - which is only possible by stealing a civilization and putting your name on it. Persian and Indian talents employed under the Mughal sword.\n\nIndia will always be defensive because its instinctive nature is to divert any economic surplus towards raising itself as a civilization, rather than on attacking others. The word ahimsa is unique to India after all.\n\nPakistan will always divert any extra money to buying weapons with which to raid India. You cannot make peace with this kind of an opponent - you must not only break their back but destroy their civilizational narrative which is based on theft and control of Indian civilization.\n\nIndia may think breaking Pakistan into two is a victory, but the invaders believe they are still coming out ahead. A 1000 years ago they came to India without an inch of land, and today they have 1/3rd of India. The very existence of Pakistan emboldens them to believe victory is near."<br />Author: 'greasesoda'  id: 'qitegj'<br />Score:182<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qitegj/the_civilizational_narrative/</li>

I consider myself right-wing, but I would not want to be around them, at all.\n\nMy definition of right-wing has more to do with forming a country that can get rid of the identity politics and is not constantly walking on eggshells because of specific groups that lose their shit when they get called out. I want history in schools that is not whitewashed. I\'m sick of self-loathing apologists and at this point I can\'t tell if they\'re larpers or actual Indians.\n\nWhen people use the term right-wing Indians and just leave it at that, not much context is there for the outside world. Such person, who otherwise may have agreed with you, would dislike you simply because you were described as a right-wing person.\n\nI just saw a post on a certain sub where someone was criticising RSS for supporting LGBT people. This sub is considered a reactionary, "right-wing" sub, which takes things to an extreme from time to time. Yet, in the comments, people were disagreeing with the OP.\n\nThe meaning of the term "right-wing" is universal, so is of the word "nationalist". But there\'s a big difference between the nationalism of a brown man in India who fought for independence, and a white nationalist in America.\n\nI think terms like "right-wing" are used effectively to get people to disagree/set a narrative through articles/opinion pieces; and believe that if such labels, and association of people and groups with said labels were to be dropped, a surprising number of people will be able to find common grounds, who would have never had a discussion otherwise.'<br />Author: 'peacefulchodi'  id: 'qhs7zp'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qhs7zp/the_terms_rightwing_and_nationalist_are_used_to/</li>

I think it has a balanced bass which is not too boomy but the higher frequencies aren't as good compared to the Sennheiser products. Since the microphone isn't working anymore, I decided to try Sony XB450AP which felt sweaty and uncomfortable even after short intervals. This brings me to Reddit, open to your suggestions!\n\nIf the price range (3.5k INR is the hard upper limit) does not allow me to have a balanced range of frequencies, I'd like to go with one that has a balanced bass (not too tight or punchy) than lots of treble. I'll be using it for literally everything - from listening to music, to lots of lectures, to talk with people (which is why it *needs* to have an in-built microphone) to occasional gaming."<br />Author: 'amswy'  id: 'qhfcrm'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qhfcrm/need_suggestions_for_earphonesheadphones_within/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Have you guys met each other, apart from the official reddit meetup? If not why?'<br />Body: 'A few months ago, I asked for help/support on this sub and many kind people have responded. And I did take their help. I went to meet them in person in their homes. I traveled all the way to Chennai,Bangalore,Vellore and I\'ve in turn invited them. I am very happy to have met these wonderful people. Thanks to all of you. Later on I got lot of support locally and made couple of friends, despite the severe language barrier.\n\nSo, why don\'t you meet each other. A new friend is always an asset. One more person that you can depend on or support in times of their need. You\'d have the benefit of a person\'s comment history before you trust. When strangers of opposite sex can meet without "fear" of "privacy" and "security" why not us guys?\n\nOf course on internet we all lie a bit ( I do, because I want to confuse the bots of reddit and camouflage my real identity, and sometimes I was just messing around, or just to evoke a reaction from others to see how they respond). This was one of the reasons of my initial hesitancy. But if we take this as a part of human nature, I think we are good to become one giant family. \n\nI share my email/phone number over anonymous chat client (I forgot its name). I\'ll lookup and edit the message later on. Or type it on an image and share it.

      <li>Title::: 'The pseudo liberal left has managed to do fine tune what Britishers had started.'<br />Body: 'Anything that seems like an alternative viewpoint to this will be labelled as right wing propoganda. Why do some individuals want to seperate Mahabharata from hindu religion? Instead of using their platform to showcase a positive side of Hindu culture, they have chosen to use a hindu text for their purpose while sidelining themselves from the text\'s source i.e.hinduism , just to appeal to the current pseudo liberal culture where it\'s essential to declare yourself as one to appear "nice". I still remember my school days when a few cool kids used to make fun of any person they saw going to a temple and scoffed at the very idea of going to one, but they\'d visit Gurudwara with their girlfriends on a holiday, visit churches every time they went to Goa. Now these examples are in no way to be considered a passive aggressive posture, it\'s a good thing to respect all cultures and it\'s very essential for us to understand other cultures and religions in order to peacefully coexist, but the problem arises when you fear that if you identify with your own religion, you\'ll be tagged a BJP supporter/right winger. That\'s pseudo liberalism for you. The left has managed to perfect the work of Britishers to instill a deep shame in the minds of natives regarding their own religion that they don\'t want to identify a text as Hindu. The left has managed to label an entire religion as Right Wing.'<br />Author: 'anshulruhil09'  id: 'qh28vk'<br />Score:65<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qh28vk/the_pseudo_liberal_left_has_managed_to_do_fine/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Redditors who went abroad for studies but decided to stay there indefinitely, what was your motivation for the decision apart from the higher salary? How did your family (parents, siblings) back in India react to your decision?'<br />Body: '8 years ago, I went abroad for my PhD with the plan of returning with a degree and some postdoctoral experience to teach and work in the IITs or NITs. However, post PhD and a postdoctoral experience later, I have realized that academia is not my cup of tea. I would like to work in industry, but compared to abroad the salaries will be extremely low in my field of study. Also, the opportunities are far less and most of the job openings in India are for masters level.\n\nCurrently I am in Canada and have received an industrial job offer with decent salary and exactly in my field. I am very happy and fortunate to get the job. However, in the back of my mind I feel guilty of forfeiting my initial intention to return back to India and be an academic there. \n\nMy parents and siblings back home wants me to settle abroad and have no monetary expectations from me. They just want me to be happy. However, I feel that I am abandoning my responsibilities towards my parents and overburdening my siblings who are well settled in India. My parents are getting old and I might not be able to personally help them out during medical emergencies, if they ever occur.\n\nMy question to people settled abroad, apart from salary, what was your motivation to settle abroad after your studies? And how do you manage your responsibilities towards your parents and what was your siblings reaction to your decision of permanently settle abroad?'<br />Author: 'poobreakphilosopher'  id: 'qh06d0'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/qh06d0/redditors_who_went_abroad_for_studies_but_decided/</li>
