Despite being charged for murder, how does he get a bail every time? \n\nHe lives in a village with his army of henchmen who recently killed 8 police officers who went to arrest them. Did the Police have no intelligence on the strength of Vikas’s army? And how come Vikas already knew about Police’s operation to be able to plan this counter strike?\n\nAt the bottom of this is the corruption in UP police and politics. This time, the police itself paid the price..\n\nI have a close relative, who’s dad was killed by his fellow police officer during an encounter (it was just a timing that suited him). Mostly because he was an honest officer on the verge of a promotion and his boss was jealous of his achievements.\n\nPolice in general in India is marred by corruption, and so many brazen things you and I can’t really imagine, but UP police is a whole different level.\n\nYogi ji really need to fix the police system...following are some steps:\n\n1. fitness test for all police officers every year. Those who fail, give 3 months to fix themselves or suspend them.\n\n2. body camera and cctv camera in police stations - Make it mandatory\n\n3. Diversify police force ...get officers from south, east so they don’t have too many local biases\n\n4. Upgrade the police stations and police equipment including cars \n\n5. Appoint psychologists for every police station to consistently check the mental health, morale etc \n\n6. Recruit more and give 2 days off every week on rotating basis (most policemen are over worked).\n\n7. Remove security for politicians - If they are unsafe, so are the citizens. Make the city safe, to be safe.\n\n8. Increase social interaction opportunities with the citizens \n\n9. Ban laila majnu squads and lathicharge for violating lockdowns etc\n\n10. When found involved in a crime, dont just transfer or suspend, try them like criminals. \n\nVikas Dubey and his team need to be eliminated asap, or many such gangsters will take over their villages soon!

While I investigate further, I'd like to know what you guys think.\n\nSo, my company is doing bad and most of the tech staff are laid off and it seems only sales guys are on the payrolls with a reduced salary. They said they'd call me back as soon as things improve though (I have contributed a lot to growth of company and I am liked a lot). But I think universe is telling me to move on.\n\nWhat I did? written lot of code, mostly enterprise web dev(Fin Tech), some systems programming early in career. Unexpectedly, I walked into people management and my last role was a PM. I managed mid sized teams very efficiently (say 70-80 people). My superiors will vouch on by abilities.\n\nWhat I want to do? While I was studying in uni, I worked with one good prof at IISc and managed two publish two papers (one and half, really). One was published in Journal of Applied Physics (2^nd author, with Prof as a first) and another one in Physical Review (B) as one of the numerous authors. My work was on theoretical polymer science, an application of variational methods in protein folding. Those days it was a hot area and many were into it (not sure about it now though). There was also one guy from SSU who was into Topology and shit of polymers working with my prof on related problem.\n\nI love math, took lot of electives and learnt a lot. As an undergrad did lot of simulations using MCMC methods for various stochastic models esp in physical chemistry of liquids.\n\nI have reasonable savings that'd sustain me for say 3.5-4 years. I don't need funds. I'll need access to journals and community. I'd like to work on some novel problems with a prof, which probably will lead me to a different career. Say as a computational scientist, in a specific domain. I have an undergrad degree from tier I institute and I think I can get good recommendations. I don't want to go abroad. PhD can be on cards (there is a formal route and exams), but I am not really looking for a degree as long as I can publish in good journals.\n\n\nI am all ears.

Guys, we need to stop supporting Nepali businesses because as we\'ve seen in the case of Manisha Koirala, these people earn their bread from our country and at the same time they openly abuse India. There\'s no need to consider Nepal as little brother or help Nepalese in any way. They have taken advantage of our generosity too much. We should show them their real place. The population of India which was considered to be a bane, is proving to be a blessing. We have the largest customer domain for every business, so we should capitalize on that power. Try to minimize dependence on any company whose shares are acquired by Chinese, boycott the Bollywood movies with agendas. Also we should try to maintain close relations with countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Myanmar. We have won freedom after thousand years, don\'t squander it just because you want.

      <li>Title::: 'Verse of the Day : Bhagavad-gita As It Is -- 3.34'<br />Body: "\\*Please write answers to the questions in comments\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**इन्द्रियस्येन्द्रियस्यार्थे रागद्वेषौ व्यवस्थितौ |**\n\n**तयोर्न वशमागच्छेतौ ह्यस्य परिपन्थिनौ || ३४ ||**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nindriyasyendriyasyārthe\n\nrāga-dveṣau vyavasthitau\n\ntayor na vaśam āgacchet\n\ntau hy asya paripanthinau\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SYNONYMS**\n\nindriyasya—of the senses; indriyasya arthe—in the sense objects; rāga—attachment; dveṣau—also in detachment; vyavasthitau—put under regulations; tayoḥ—of them; na—never; vaśam—control; āgacchet—one should come; tau—those; hi—certainly are; asya—his; paripanthinau—stumbling blocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRANSLATION**\n\n**Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThose who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one's wife. All other women are to be considered as one's mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astray-as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of Kṛṣṇa detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from Kṛṣṇa consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures ? Why one should be unattached to them ? How is Kṛṣṇa consciousness helpful in this ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/nat9mebmwk851.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=999c8316381c248e1acbe0abeafaf7b8a7ba35ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'hkdhdh'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hkdhdh/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_334/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The North West Frontier Province (known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa today) should have been a part of India (read thread below). READ how NEHRU’s PETTINESS AND STUPIDITY led to us MEEKLY CONCEDING the territory (which should’ve been part of India) to Pakistan. DISHEARTENING'<br />Body: 'Historian and Civil Servant, and former director of the National Archives of India, Raghavendra Singh in his book, “India’s Lost Frontier” argues that the NWFP served as a strategic bulwark for India that negated Jinnah’s Two Nation Theory (from Brookings India), since the CONGRESS WON the 1946 elections there despite it being a MAJORITY MUSLIM province. \n\nHe argues that it is imperative to recognise that the docile acceptance of NWFP\'s loss in 1947 may have serious consequences for India\'s security (given the NWFP’s geopolitical and strategic importance) in times to come.\n\nIn his presentation, Singh covered the decision-making process behind NWFP joining Pakistan. He argued that India’s negligence and in particular, the Congress which “very knowingly let this province go to Pakistan” was critical in allowing India to lose this province. \n\nTo support this argument, Singh questioned Jawaharlal Nehru’s decision in April 1947 to hold elections in the province “on the same issue of Pakistan that was held in 1946,” where the Congress, led by its leader Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, came to power with a comfortable majority. \n\nHe explained that the Chief Minister of the province was called to Delhi with an idea of giving it a “veneer of consultation” – evident in Lord Mountbatten’s report to Whitehall which mentions that “Nehru wanted it that way.” The decision to hold elections (later converted to a referendum), put Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan in a position where he could not owe his allegiance to India.\n\nSingh also quoted an excerpt from his book in which the then Congress President Acharya Kripalani admits that the ‘Congress had no intention of sending anyone from outside the province to influence the voters there for the referendum’ and advised Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan to ‘avoid electioneering speeches’.\n\nIn this 1948 referendum, voters were given two options: either to join India, or to join Pakistan. The Khudai Khidmatgars led by “Frontier Gandhi” Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan boycotted the elections in protest. \n\nThe eligible voting population was only around 500,000 despite the total population of the province being over 4 million. The turnout in the vote was only 50.5%, with turnout being lowest among NON-MUSLIMS (1.16%). Non-Muslims comprised MORE THAN 35% of the population and NEARLY 30% of the electorate. They were not represented, not even heard. \n\nOnly about 3 lakh people voted, obviously 99% of them voted for Pakistan, but all of Khan’s supporters sat the polls out, as did Congress supporters and non-Muslims. Even the turnout among Muslims was weak. \n\nBased on this FARCE of a referendum, the British decided to award the NWFP to Pakistan. This was despite the fact that Frontier Gandhi’s Khudai Khidmatgars and the Congress formed an alliance to DEFEAT THE MUSLIM LEAGUE in the provincial elections of 1946. \n\nIn fact, the Muslim League won only 17 out of the 36 Muslim seats in the Frontier Province. The Congress won 30 seats overall, which is nearly TWICE as many in the same province. This election proved categorically that the support for Pakistan in the Frontier Province was mixed at best, and actually very low if you look at the numbers (17/36 Muslim seats won only). \n\nNevertheless, the greedy Muslim League, the cunning and wily British and the deer-in-headlights Congress Party led by the clueless Nehru-Gandhi cabal partitioned the country and awarded the Frontier Province to Pakistan. \n\n"A disheartened Ghaffar Khan -- a close friend of Mahatma Gandhi and a key political figure of NWFP -- once said that "neither the issue of partition nor of referendum in NWFP was discussed with us...we were stunned to find out that the decision on both the issues had already been taken by the Congress High Command," Singh writes.\n\n"After the Working Committee\'s meeting on June 3, 1947, I said to Gandhiji, -- you have thrown us to the wolves\', the book quotes Ghaffar Khan as saying.\n\nGhaffar Khan, who founded the \'Khudai Khidmatgar\' (servants of god) movement in 1929 against the British rule in India and associated with the Congress, felt grievously let down by the Congress leaders who had assured him that they would never accept partition, Singh says.\n\n"The \'Khudai Khidmatgars\' were not even given any advance notice; instead they were asked to fend for themselves, leaving them completely in the lurch. I was in Delhi at that time yet nobody whispered a word to me, the book quotes Ghaffar Khan as saying.\n\nThe British knew and so did the Congress, of the strategic importance of the NWFP. They realised how crucial it was to sustain its ministry during those years. Recognising the significance, Mahatma Gandhi toured the frontier twice with the sole purpose of resolving factional disputes in the provincial Congress, according to the book.\n\n"Two elections were held, in 1937 and 1946. Despite the province being Muslim-dominated, the Congress won a large number of seats. British civil servants conspired with the Muslim League to ensure that support was transferred from the Congress to the League," he said. "The League started gaining strength, and the Congress started losing support in just a couple of months-between February, when elections were held, and August." When Nehru was alerted, he was dismissive of the developments, Mukherjee claimed.\n\nThe book by Singh notes how Jawaharlal Nehru\'s visit to the province in October 1946 had disastrous consequences.\n\nAt the start of his visit, Nehru was greeted with a large unfriendly crowd at Peshawar airport after which he had to be whisked away. His convey was heckled, his aircraft sniped at and his car stoned.\n\nHe needed constant escorting by the army and uniformed personnel. Nehru even had to leave without meeting the tribesmen.\n\nA bullet fired by an NWFP tribesman came very close to Nehru while he was sitting in the car.\n\nAccording to the book, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, had maintained till April 1947 that elections would be held in the NWFP and the newly elected representatives would also have the option of declaring themselves as an independent Constituent Assembly.\n\nBut on May 1, he introduced a new proposal of holding a referendum in the NWFP.\n\n"The reason for Mountbatten\'s changed stance was Nehru. It was Nehru who had earlier agreed to the possibility of holding elections in the NWFP and then shown a preference for a referendum," the writer claims and wonders if Nehru consulted the NWFP government or more importantly, Ghaffar Khan, before suggesting such a momentous changes?  \n \n\nThe results of the referendum, boycotted by the Khan brothers and Pathans who believed in a free Pathan state, were overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan, Singh says.\n\nThe blame game on who lost the frontier for India has long since gone on. "On August 14, 1947, the day when the NWFP formally became an integral part of Pakistan, it still had a Congress ministry. The first undemocratic act of the Pakistan government was to dismiss it on August 22," the book says.\n\nAbdul Gaffar Khan had no choice but to pledge his allegiance to Pakistan after partition (his people were there) and immediately opposed the ruling elite, forming his own party, the Pakistan Azad Party, which was to be secular in nature. The elected Congress government was dismissed less than a week after partition by the Pak government. He was hounded by the Punjabi ruling class for many years, and arrested repeatedly for his activism and his standing up for the rights of Pashtun people. He died under house arrest in Peshawar in 1988.'<br />Author: 'dukegabon'  id: 'hk850x'<br />Score:42<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hk850x/the_north_west_frontier_province_known_as_khyber/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Why are a lot of Indian liberals and seculars from the uppermost caste and class?'<br />Body: "I can understand if a lot of Dalits, tribals or people from low income background become a secular liberal. Like Black people in the US voting for Democrats, I can understand if they root for secular parties of India. After all, there was systemic discrimination in India for a long long time.\n\n**But the reality seems different.** Often when a liberal or secular person comes to a TV show, he/she looks like someone from a very privileged background. And when you Google their family history, they do indeed are the descendants of so-and-so community. It is often the right-wing spokesperson who looks like someone from a much less privileged background. So what's happening here? \n\nI think what's happening is **systemic discrimination of ideas.** Just like their ancestors, they think of themselves to be different from the masses. So for example, if the masses embrace Hindu nationalism, they do the opposite, by rooting secular globalism, just to be different. Why? Because they always consider themselves to be different (and better) compared to the masses. \n\nJust to be clear, not all people from the upper caste or class think this way, but for those who do, I think they're just further reinforcing social hierarchy, contrary to what they preach."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'hk4p3d'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hk4p3d/why_are_a_lot_of_indian_liberals_and_seculars/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'India should not overreact to Chinese aggression. Change my mind.'<br />Body: "While the recent rise in anti-Chinese sentiment is completely justified following current developments, I'm here to argue that the best approach that India could take is to have little to no retaliation. My reasons are as follows:\n\n**1) China already has problems in many fronts, it'll be a huge drain to India if China focuses a lot of its resources on dealing with India.** India should be careful of not becoming like Soviet Union in WW2, they won together with other allies, but at the cost of 24 million deaths. Even India had a bigger WW2 casualty than US and UK combined. In the current scenario, India shouldn't pay the bulk of military and economic cost of dealing with China, let US be its principal rival. The Americans conveniently make a lot of noise, but don't do much. \n\n**2) Most of the time, reacting to your enemy's maneuvers is a poor strategy.** The reason for that is because, unless you've anticipated their move, you become a slave of your enemy's actions. You think China didn't weigh in all of the possible things India could do should they escalate border tensions? I think the Modi govt is well aware of not falling into Chinese trap, but unfortunately Indian liberals, for their own political interests, are challenging the Center to do more. \n\n**3) The best geopolitical stance for India in the next two decades is to be equidistant to China and USA.** As much as Indians may hate having closer ties with untrustworthy Chinese, it is the best position to be in. India needs to have only **ONE BIG** long-term goal, which is to ensure all of its population get out of poverty and get access to basic resources. Unfortunately bad ties with China will adversely affect that goal."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'hk12zw'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hk12zw/india_should_not_overreact_to_chinese_aggression/</li>

Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of māyā simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. Kṛṣṇa consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties. Therefore, without being fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yogī or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one's position and to try to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of māyā.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one is bound by the modes of nature ?

Ofcourse just this isnt going to solve the problems Im about to state and hell there might be more to this than I can think of because I generally tend to stay away from content like this. But this according to me is a step in the right direction and we'll see how to go from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose of us who have been on reddit would have experienced multiple times in how whole of reddit is just okay about making fun of Indians but absolutely nothing gets done about it and its swept under the rug as normal. I'm not implying that we're in the racial hot seat and theres some serious hate speech going on but this sort of casual discrimination isnt acceptable either. My issue isnt just this, its also that we already have a small section of society whose got inferiority complex, self hate due to unreasonable expectations and is constantly looking for gora validation and this is a platform for those people. Just imagine the affect this sort of behavior this might have on younger kids who browse reddit, their minds are still developing and this might distort their understanding of what our country actually is, the challenges we've faced and how we are doing now. For fucks sake we just pulled almost 300mil people out of poverty in the last decade and theres still stereotypes of shitting in the street prevalent on this site. The only other country which has done something comparable to this is China, at huge costs.\n\n  \nAll that sub does is reinforces the existing, old Indian stereotypes. About us having poor english, bob vagne memes etc. Only maybe 1 in maybe 100 posts is something original and everything else is the exact copy of each other. \n\nIf this sort of behavior was targeted at any other races reddit would be losing their shit right now.  Just go visit blackpeopletwitter or whitepeopletwitter, not only the posts are much tamer, but when blackpeopletwitter decided that only verified black people could participate, there was so much drama, it was national news and even nytimes had an article about it.

Many students have personally dealt/witnessed such incidents where teachers loose their cool , and end up beating the students inhumanly. We can compare the fear of the students facing such incidents, with a  documentaries of animal torture. Aren't students human too ? Don't they have human rights ?

When a colonized country transfers $50 Billion to another every year, it is well worth it for the colonizer to invest a few tens of millions in preventing anything from stopping that."<br />Author: 'detether'  id: 'hj0e3q'<br />Score:164<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hj0e3q/now_communist_party_of_india_marxist_is_trying_to/</li>

The OP got so triggered and started making personal remarks and attacks on people who replied Sanskrit. He claimed that 'Tamil' is the oldest language in the world and that Modi government is hiding true facts about it which sounds absolutely bonkers. So that made me wonder why are Tamilains so passionate about this debate? What exactly does it prove and how does it matter which language is the oldest.

      <li>Title::: 'Know thy History! My fellow Indians please read authentic historical works.'<br />Body: '#  History is too important to be left alone to Historians!\n\nSo recently I have taken upon myself to create well-cited notes on the history of ***Bharat!***\n\nI was going through all the authors for citations and I noticed some strange things\\~\n\n&gt;How does one make a civilization weak and emotionally and intellectually vulnerable?  \nIt is simple you just take away the only pride that one might have and whitewash that to make them believe that they were barbaric LOWER IQ people who could not manage anything on their own! So they put all that morally depressing things in our History Books!\n\n *I noticed some strange things! All the post-NEHRUVIAN/INDIRA reign our History books started getting hijacked by the* ***Leftist/Assumed Centrist/Marxists.*** *Any Uninformed person if reads those books then all he will think is that OUR HISTORY is pathetic and we were a bunch of savages who were colonised by INVADERS/HUNS/TURKS/GREEKS/MUGHALS/EUROPEANS/BRITISHERS and everything came from them!*\n\nBut the reality is far away from it! One will only feel sad and depressed if one reads those books!\n\nLike I was referring ***UPINDER SINGH*** book on ancient India history and her pejorative of referring to ***GUPTA EMPIRE*** was so visible! She apparently the daughter of Former PM Manmohan Singh! No wonder she might have been involved in "CONGRESS RAJDARBAR" to get politically entrenched! But she is smart! From her writings, she will call out Marxist Historians and Nationalist School of thought historians that we should look at history without bias! But then she always takes a U\\~Turn. All this is "HISTORY AL TAQIYA" and she slowly starts injecting ***MARXIST BIAS*** in her books! By reading her books one will hardly feel any pride! SO instead of getting our chest swollen up with pride, it sinks in with low self-esteem! Unfortunately, she is an EMINENT PROF in Delhi University! So according to her GUPTA EMPIRE IS NOT THE GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA! (Guess what as Marxist she is smart to hit the right spot by lowering down the only empire that really in all sense was the TRUE GOLDEN AGE EMPIRE OF CLASSICAL INDIA!) \n\n# So they attack that! This reminds me of interesting lines~\n\n&gt;*It all boils down to pride. Italian city-states, post-Christian Central Europe - all wanted to claim at least cultural successorship to Rome\'s legacy. Rome was that one girl everyone wants to have but cannot.*  \n*Rome, therefore, got remembered in annals as that continuously coveted girl whom everyone wanted to sleep with, some did, some did not and some raped her because she plainly refused but then again - they all got what they wanted.*  \n*Now contrast with the Gupta Empire -*  \n*A people who hate their own past will not tend to remember it like some prize woman coveted overtimes, nor will they try remembering it as a time when they were the best. It boils down psychologically to the fact that while Rome became European invaders\' trophy courtesan, the Gupta period became the whore of history.*  \n*Empires are not called empires because they recorded themselves as such in history. Empires are called empires only because its peoples\' descendants choose to recognize the history that way. For instance, the Mughal \'empire\' got destroyed and de-facto abolished many times before its dynastic end had actually arrived and yet - books call it the Mughal empire. Reason - the people who wrote those books would rather remember Turko-Mongol Islamic rule as a continuous prized memory of history rather than whatever your status explains.*  \n*Psychology of people remembering history is normally the answer to questions pertaining to the later interpretation of history as well.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Ok. Riddle me this.*  \n*The Roman Empire was, in the course of its existence, dissolved several times, changed hands even more, was split up, parcelled out, apportioned, quartered, gambled away, bought back, and otherwise rendered defunct multiple times- but it\'s still called the \'Roman Empire\'.*  \n*On the other hand:-*  \n*1- Sri Gupta (240 AD to 280 AD) (Founder of the Empire)*  \n*2- Ghatotkacha Gupta (280 AD to 319 AD)*  \n*3- Chandra Gupta (320 AD to 335 AD)*  \n*4- Samudra Gupta (335 AD to 380 AD)*  \n*5- Rama Gupta (380 AD to 382 AD)*  \n*6- Chandra Gupta 2/ (aka Vikramaditya) (382 AD to 415 AD)*  \n*7- Kumara Gupta (415 AD to 455 AD)*  \n*8- Skanda Gupta (455 AD to 467 AD)*  \n*9- Puru Gupta (467 AD to 473 AD)*  \n*10- Kumara Gupta (473 AD to 476 AD)*  \n*11- Buddha Gupta (476 AD to 495 AD)*  \n*12- Narasimha Gupta (495 AD to 523 AD)*  \n*13- Kumara Gupta (523 AD to 540 AD)*  \n*14- Vainya Gupta (540 AD to 550 AD)*  \n*15- Bhanu Gupta (550 AD to 557 AD)*  \n*16- Krishna Gupta (557 AD to 559 AD)*  \n*17- Harsha Gupta*  \n*18- Jivita Gupta (few days)*  \n*19- Kumara Gupta (560s AD to 570s AD)*  \n*20- Damodara Gupta (few days)*  \n*21- Mahasena Gupta (570 AD to 580 AD)*  \n*22- Prabhakara Pushyabhuti (son-in-law of Mahasena; 580 to 604 AD)*  \n*23- Rajyavardhana Pushyabhuti (604 AD to 606 AD)*  \n*24- Harshavardhana Pushyabhuti (606 AD to 647 AD)*  \n*25- Unnamed noble (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n*26- (?) Varmana (690s AD to 725 D)*  \n*27- Yashoda Varmana (725 AD to 752 AD)*  \n*28- Unnamed Varmana Heir*  \n*29- Ama(?) Varmana (780s AD to 832 AD)*  \n*30- Dundhaka Varmana (833 AD to 860s AD)*  \n*31- Bhoja Varmana (No Conclusive Data present)*  \n*So, we have a single Empire extending over most of North India from Punjab to Bengal, with Sindh and Orissa being taken into the Empire every so often, and extending well into the Deccan and North East for centuries at a time- lasting almost uninterrupted for more than 600 years. This Empire demonstrates remarkable continuity in rule- with power passing fairly smoothly from ruler to successor across three dynasties, linked by both blood and election.*  \n*This Empire lasted two period of massive climatic upheaval that led to the destruction of multiple Empires across Europe, South America, Persia, and China- and encompassed the \'Golden Age of India\' in the 4th Century- presiding over a flourishing of Art, Culture, and Literature the World has scarcely seen- with an almost exacting continuity of Ethos and Belief.*  \n*So- why is \'Roman Empire\' a legitimate usage while the \'Gupta-Vardhamana\' Empire isn\'t? The iconography in their coins is consistent, the focus on Emperors being scholar-soldiers is consistent. Their military representation- with the Brahminy Kite standard- is consistent. The administrative organization- barring the steady change from centralized Empire under Sri Gupta to a wholly internally-divided Feudal state under the Varmana- is consistent as well.*\n\nSO, my friends, History creates a narrative! OUR GRAND NARRATIVE and IT Should be known to all!\n\n***Here are some authors that one should stay away\\~***\n\n* Romila Thapar(MARXIST)\n* Irfan Habib(MARXIST)\n* RS Sharma(MARXIST)\n* Upinder Singh(Calls herself NEUTRAL YET INJECTS MARXISM)\n* Bipin Chandra\n* Satish Chandra\n* Ramchandra Guha\n* Kosambi\n* D.N Jha\n\n**SOME AUTHORS WHICH YOU SHOULD READ\\~**\n\n* *RC Majumdar* (The Granddaddy of all Historians in India.

      <li>Title::: 'POSCO wanted to set up a steel plant in India. Planned investment $12bn. expected employment:40,000 (direct). But, communists rallied against it. Forced the company to abandon the plant. Now, India is importing steel from China, while we export iron ore.'<br />Body: "&gt;A short thread on POSCO plant in Odisha (I worked in Steel industry for 5 years)\n\n&gt;1. Odisha is iron ore resource rich state (substantial reserves of low grade iron ore too)\n\n&gt;2. POSCO is a pioneer in COREX technology which uses low grade iron ore\n\n&gt;3. First MoU signed in 2005\n\n&gt;4. First Odisha government said they will give land and mines, and POSCO wanted a port, so Paradip was a perfect place to have the 12mtpa steel plant right next to the port for exports.\n\n&gt;5. 12mtpa plant in a single location would have been the biggest plant at that time in India\n\n&gt;6. POSCO said they will bring the latest technologies + FINEX to upgrade low grade ores and introduce many specialty steel grades that India imports. Expert in FINEX - @ShahZankit\n\n&gt;7. Then they said based on the success they will build more capacity in the mines to export ores. \n\n\n&gt;8. First mistake - immediately protests started saying our mines are given out free and they are making money out of it and Odisha government got cold feet and started dragging on giving clearances\n\n&gt;9. Even then after recession, POSCO were still interested &amp; ready to pay for land\n\n&gt;10. But the government couldn't acquire even half of the 4100 acres requested by POSCO\n\n&gt;11. Then POSCO made a 2nd mistake of identifying agriculture land (mainly beetles/tobacco cultivation) in the Paradip area, as the protests erupted, the over enthusiastic newspaper made it big\n\n&gt;12. Huge protests started across India and the government went into paralysis mode\n\n&gt;13. Odisha government could have stepped in to provide better compensation or otherwise given land for the plant at another location but did neither\n\n&gt;14. Issue was taken upto the PMO but no action\n\n&gt;15. POSCO still wanted to build in Odisha and were ready to pay for the mines and land, but by the time 2012 they lost all hope and decided to cut their losses and leave\n\n&gt;16. A big loss for Indian steel industry, it would have been a 70000 crore investment\n\n&gt;17. If that investment had materialized smoothly, Odisha would have been a success story for the next 50 years\n\n&gt;18. Many companies got cold feet to invest in Odisha fearing loss of money and time, bad press and lethargic bureaucracy\n\n&gt;19. People think it was one investment that got away, it doesn't work that way.Businesses do deep internal analysis before they make an investment\n\n&gt;20. I was interning at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada &amp; the Sales Head - India told me, Indian bureaucracy had the biggest ego he encountered\n\nhttps://twitter.com/theindianseeker/status/1277204228109295619\n\nWire eulogizing the communist who led the protests against Posco. \n\nhttps://thewire.in/rights/gananath-patra-communist-leader-passes-away\n\nProtests against otehr steelmakers in Odisha continue. \n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-villagers-oppose-jsw-steel-plant-proposed-in-land-acquired-for-posco-growing/article29994027.ece"<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'hif0x8'<br />Score:769<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hif0x8/posco_wanted_to_set_up_a_steel_plant_in_india/</li>

TikTok is banned now in India.\nInteresting.\nI am writing this after  watching a recent video by Rick Beato\nIn Rick\'s video, he says that he talked to a few A&amp;R guys from major record labels about how major record labels look for artistes to sign. The platforms they look at and all.\nFun fact, the ones in the US actually look at TikTok first and are signing most artistes from there and then YouTube, after that, maybe Instagram.\n\nPeople over the world use apps very differently. \nSo tbh, I don\'t get a lot of people who say the app should be gone cause a lot of the content on it is cringe etc.\nThat\'s bullshit. \nWhatsApp forwards have literally sparked riots due to misinformation in places. No one is coming forward to say Ban that or whatever.\nSame goes for a lot of stuff on YouTube.\n\nI won\'t really talk about the whole Chinese app thing cause I don\'t have enough research on that and also on what other Chinese apps and all are getting banned.\nSo I will shut up about the things I don\'t know \n\n "We don\'t own any connections that we made here"\n\nThink about it.\nSome content creator probably put a lot of effort in their TikTok accounts.\nIf tomorrow, I was to lose my facebook or my instagram accounts just like that. I would be very hurt.\n\nI have years of my writing, posts, friendships and connections on these platforms.\nThis ban culture thing is dangerous and I hope anyone supporting it for the reasons that I have stated above rethink it.\n\nIf you still support it, no scene, respect your opinion.'<br />Author: 'skapaxd'  id: 'hi8vjx'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hi8vjx/opinion_on_the_reality_of_social_media_tiktok_ban/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] Russia-Taliban nexus, Uighur genocide underway, and Operation Acoustic Kitty'<br />Body: "Welcome back to the Geopolitics Thread after a long hiatus. The world has been caught up in the COVID-19 Pandemic, which has dominated headlines everywhere including in India. However, as the world moves into a difficult 'new normal,' the world of geopolitics is lighting up again. We discuss those events here. Discussion does not have to be related to India. Here are some top stories to get the ball rolling:\n\n# Top 5 stories\n\n1. [Report alleges Russian intelligence paid Taliban to kill US troops](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/politics/russian-bounties-taliban-us-troops/index.html)\n\nIn a bombshell report from the NYT, it is alleged that the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU, paid bounties to the Taliban to kill US soldiers in Afghanistan. In effect, this alleges that Russia has been funding the Taliban. The report has led to a massive flutter in Washington, DC although the White House is yet to make any substantive statement on it. President Donald Trump, since being elected, has tried to mend the relationship with Russia, presumably to shore up an anti-China alliance that has been the centerpiece of his foreign policy. The Taliban has denied taking any money from Russia, although not the killings themselves. \n\n2. [Seattle's CHOP devolves into anarchy](https://www.foxnews.com/us/seattle-chop-shooting-protest)\n\nSince the nationwide protests against police brutality against African-Americans, a small section of Seattle has been virtually taken over by protesters. Going by various names, such as Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) and Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP), this occupation zone of sorts was created after a police station was forcefully cleared by protesters. Since then, the zone has become a sort of nation unto itself, boasting of its own little economy and leadership following socialism. However, after a spree of killings and violence, pressure is growing for the police to re-enter the zone and break it up. \n\n3. [Israel plans controversial annexation of West Bank enclaves](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-annexation-un/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-halt-illegal-annexation-plan-idUSKBN24015E)\n\nThe Unity government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel is planning to begin the process to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank into itself, a controversial move that has brought upon criticism from the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and even his own alliance partners. The move would formalize land that is already administered by Israel but claimed by Palestine as part of its territory. Critics fear that annexation would render any two-state solution impossible.\n\n4. [Insurgents attack Karachi Stock Exchange](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-attacks/gunmen-attack-pakistani-stock-exchange-seven-killed-police-idUSKBN2400IS)\n\nGunmen claiming affiliation with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) stormed the Karachi Stock Exchange in an attempt to hijack the building, although they were stopped by security forces. Two guards and a policemen were killed and all 4 gunmen were shot down as well. Pakistani politicians and security establishment are laying the blame on India's intelligence agency, RAW. However, the MEA retorted, “unlike Pakistan, India has no hesitation in condemning terrorism anywhere in the world, including in Karachi.” \n\n5. [China forcing sterilization of Uighur women to kill off their population: AP](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-forcibly-sterilizing-uighur-women-xinjiang-abortions-contraception-ap-2020-6)\n\nIn yet another gruesome report on the ongoing attempt by the Chinese to Sinicize the Uighur minority, the AP reports that Chinese authorities have been running a campaign involving hundreds of thousands of women, which includes forced abortions, involuntary sterilizations, forced contraception, and outright jailing women that have more than two children. Over a million Uighur men are already locked away in concentration camps. Families have been forced to re-decorate their homes in Han-Chinese fashion and to sing so-called patriotic songs in Mandarin in order to receive food. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Operation Acoustic Kitty\n\nDuring the Cold War, both the KGB and the CIA were known to come up with rather innovative techniques to spy on each other's countries. In the 1960s, the CIA determined that cats would be suitable spies inside the Kremlin. Specifically, cats with listening devices surgically implanted into their ear canals. A pilot project was launched to spy on diplomats outside the Soviet Embassy in Washington, DC. \n\nHowever, it soon became clear that there was a major problem: the cats didn't play ball. While they could be trained to walk short distances, environmental variability and the cats' sense of hunger made them highly unpredictable. After spending $20 mn on the project, it was cancelled in 1967, largely considered a failure, although some accounts claim it has limited success. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What stories caught your attention?*"<br />Author: 'icecoolsushobhan'  id: 'hi6px4'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hi6px4/biweekly_geopolitics_thread_russiataliban_nexus/</li>

There are no signs of reduction of daily COVID-19 cases in India with currently 20k cases per day. Exposure of thousands of students to public transport and crowded examination centres can cause rapid spread of virus among students.\n\n2. Final year students have already proven themselves by passing previous 7 semester exams. Another semester result will not change the total aggregates much. Why not just cancel their exams as well.\n\n3. The final semester has fewer theoretical subjects as compared to other semesters. A major portion of the total marks is covered by projects, seminar reports and internal assessments. Marks can be easily assigned to them on the basis of internal assessments.\n\n4. Universities are also conducting offline practical exams. These colleges have no facilities for safety of students. Masks, sanitizer, and thermal screening are just formalities. Most of the cases are asymptomatic, therefore thermal screening is not effective here.\n\n5. With the regular delay in exams and results, students can neither apply for jobs nor apply for higher studies. Major IT companies are allowing employees to work from home. Some IITs are also planning to start new semester in online mode.\n\n6. Students who are already placed, can’t join their companies because they have no degree yet. In this economic crisis, some companies are taking back their job offers. With the regular delay in exam results, we are afraid of losing our job offers.\n\n7. Many Students are living in states other than their university state. With no railways and private transport facilities, it is very hard and dangerous for them to reach their respective examination centres. \n\n8.

It\'s about my personal experience in Nepal. It was refreshing and I didn\'t find any reason to complain.\n\nObservations-\n\n1. Nepal is one of the few tourist states where you won\'t get fleeced by hoardes of touts the moment you land in the airport and set your foot out of it. Atleast not like Delhi. As an Indian,Food in Nepal was cheap and was of relatively the same quality as of India. \n\n2. I do not know if it\'s due to the relatively thin population or something else,it felt safe to be in Kathmandu (Thamel and the road infront of the Narayanhatti palace). The females of our group went on a walk freely on the roads at the middle of the night. This would have been unimaginable in some capital cities. \n\n3.  Nepalese people are very courteous and most importantly accommodative. All the hoteliers I met were more than accommodative to our sometimes dominating demands. It\'d have been impossible if it were India. \n\n4. Surprisingly there was some Anti Hindu rhetoric which I was exposed to. During a trip to the Mala palace,a couple of guides were busy espousing a theory of Nepal being forcibly converted to Hinduism from Buddhism by the Shankaracharya. Now,while I could find no source or reference for this,the man was convinced that this was the case. I am not a practicing hindu myself,and I\'ve known a few cases where actual conversions were done,but Nepal was not one of the places. The fact that this rhetoric was spouted freely seems to convey that Nepal is relatively open to dissent. \n\n5. Even more surprising was the fact that most Nepalese in my anecdotal experience, didn\'t go to temples as much as they went to the Pagoda in Kathmandu. The Pagoda was quite famous admittedly,but Tibetans are far and few in Nepal,and most people out there were kids from school coming in for a walk. Meanwhile at Pashupatinath,all the people out there were Indians. I couldn\'t understand this dichotomy at first. However, decreasing religiousity levels can offer atleast some sort of explanation. \n\n6. Idk why but every truck has the sentence "Buddha was born in Nepal" written out there. Ok,some Indians might be ignorant about it,but it has been turned into a national slogan out there'<br />Author: 'bhopadbhopad'  id: 'hh73kp'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hh73kp/a_personal_view_of_nepal/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Analysis of Shekhar Gupta\'s article named "Xi has thrown the gauntlet at Modi. He can pick it up like Nehru, or try something new"'<br />Body: 'An [opinion piece](https://web.archive.org/web/20200620193740/https://theprint.in/national-interest/xi-has-thrown-the-gauntlet-at-modi-he-can-pick-it-up-like-nehru-or-try-something-new/445219/) written by Shekhar Gupta appeared in thePrint on 20th June 2020. There are some misplaced basic assumtions in the article that set the tone of the whole article and put Mr.Gupta analysis way off the mark. \n\nArticle is about Modi’s options in the ongoing Inda-China standoff. Article is filled with same assumptions and opisions some of which are repeated in Indian media often and some of them, you will find, in Shekhar Gupta’s articles on geo-politics every single time for example Mr.Gupta has an aversion to non-alignment and India’s strategic autonomy. \n\n1. #Defending borders is optional\n\nWhenever China threatens to breach the border (In places where there is no clearly demarcated border status quo is considered demarcation) and Indian forces respond with backing of current political leadership Mr.Gupta terms it as Modi trying to look “look hard, decisive, risk-taking” as if not defending border can be an option. He writes:\n\n“*He, however, shares one weakness with Nehru: A larger than life public image, and a thin skin. That is what Xi has seen as an exposed flank. From Chumar to Doklam to Pulwama, the Chinese have noticed how vital a factor “face” is for Modi in his domestic politics. There is a compulsion to look hard, decisive, risk-taking, start something and then conclude it in a way you can claim victory. That is not such an easy option against China.*”\n\nWhen the enemy is breaching your borders with armed forces you do not have an option to “look” soft or hard, you only have one option to drive enemy forces out. Not driving them out is not an option. People sitting on constitutional post take oath, at the time of their appointment, to uphold sovereignty and integrity of India. Those who do not uphold that duty are clearly committing treason. \n\nHowever, It has been considered optional for far too long in India and we have lost large tracts of land to China’s salame slicing pertaining to this thought if it can be called a thought. It would be more accurate to call it the success of China’s psyops to convince people of a India that preserving its borders is optional and can be given up in persuit of good relations with China. \n\n2. #Not accepting the reality of India’s hostile neighbourhood\n\nShekhar Gupta writes:\n\n“*It takes Modi back to the dilemmas all his predecessors have faced. Is India fated by geography and history to endure a two-front situation? How can India change this? “Can it reach out to either of the two (Pakistan or China) and break out of the triangulation? If so, which one?*”\n\nThe reality is India has never faced a two front war. Is that a possibility? Yes. Our armed forces have taken that into account and developed capacity accordingly. It is to be noted that Pakistan’s “all weather friend” China has never attacked India to help Pakistan in any of the wars so far. Not even in the most recent Kargil war. \n\nIndia is destined to have a two front situation and never to have friendly peace with either Pakistan or China till they accept India’s hegemony or India accept theirs. This is the hard to swallow geopolitical pill Luteyen’s commentators unwilling to face and fearful to express cause it is their habit to avoid harsh sounding truths. To avoid such truths they spin a yarn of nonsense like terming not responding to Pakistan sponsored terrorism in India “strategic restraint”.  This makes them easy target for our neighbour’s psyops. \n\nWhenever an action is taken to deter our neighbours from carrying out violence against us these people start calling for peace. Sounds way to much like turning the other cheek. Sadly, turning the other cheek never won any wars, not even the one of India’s independence as is falsely claimed in school history textbooks in India. \n\nNeigbouring countries can have peace only when they have a well defined relationship and one accept the hegemony of the other. An example of this is U.S.A and Canada. In this relationship U.S. is clearly the big brother and Canada a follower. \n\nOn the other hand when the relationship is not defined and enforced there is constant bickering like in case of India and Nepal. India and Nepal’s relationship is claerly defined but has not been enforced in a long time which makes Nepal think it can have all the benefits from India and stab it too with Chinese support. \n\n3. #Giving up Strategic autonomy (freedom to formulate our foreign policy) is good for India’s security\n\n“....*can it (India) still remain essentially non-aligned?\nFor clarity, if you give up that pretence and align with any big powers, you cannot also hold on to Cold War notions of strategic autonomy. Can you trade them for better security?\nEvery choice involves compromises. Modi has to pick one. Nehru junked his inflated notions of non-alignment and reached out to Kennedy’s America for help in 1962. Help came, and he permitted the Americans to even set up a military mission in New Delhi headed by a two-star general. This came at a price.\nThe Western powers dissuaded Pakistan from taking advantage of India’s predicament in October-November 1962, but in December, Sardar Swaran Singh was negotiating under duress with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on Kashmir. This was in return for Western support. Swaran Singh stalled, and as Nehru declined, Kennedy was assassinated, and the American opportunity was gone. India swung Centre-Left again.\nIndira Gandhi was sharper. In 1971, when the Bangladesh opportunity came, she knew she could only win if something could keep China off India’s back. She signed that Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union, which was a euphemism for a strategic alliance. It gave her those few weeks’ leeway to finish the war.*”\nThis part of the article is most agitating. I am sure you must have felt a revolt inside you when you heard something deliberately stupid, especially, a spin by media persons. This is that part. It asks the question can India be non-alligned. \n\nThe simple answer to that is yes India can and should be non-aligned. India that has been non-aligned during the bipolar cold war era when the whole world was divided into either of the two blocks, when being non-aligned meant not having a big brother watching your back and being vulnurable geo-politically. India that not only remained non-aligned but was the founder and leader of non-aligned movement. \n\nIt is also important to note what “alignment” means here. It means to have foreign policy tied up with, if not downright dictated by, another nation. There is a whole spectrum of nations aligned with bigger powers. On the lower end of this spectrum is Pakistan which completely depends for its existence on the nation it is “aligned” with. Now experts openly call Pakistan a client State. On the other end of this spectrum is a powerful nation like Japan which, though economically powerful, is subservient to the U.S. when it comes to world affairs. \n\nThis article sneer at strategic autonomy by calling it a “cold war notion”. In fact being part of a bloc or “align” with with a superpower is very much a cold war notion which has since been discarded and made almost obsolete in a multipolar world. \n\nIf India aspire to be a free nation and a world power it has to retain strategic autonomy. Most things that we aspire to are things that we will gain in future but strategic autonomy is one thing we have and it makes sense to keep it rather than to sign it away. All the powerful nations be it U.S., Russia or China have strategic autonomy. Perhaps It is Mr. Gupta’s own projection of inferiority on the whole nation when he fail to think of India as a State with strategic autonomy which, by the way, India already has and is being adviced to give up by Mr.Gupta by dismissing it as a cold war notion. \n\nLet’s look at it in a different way. Strategic autonomy is just a fancy word for freedom. Can we trade our freedom to formulate our foreign policy for better security? Sounds like something a Raja of a riyasat might have had in mind when they signed the subsidary alliance and agreed to be British protectorate. Freshen up the whole subsidary alliance of Richard Wellesley which helped British to take over one Indian state after another. For the initiated By the late 18th century, the power of the Maratha Empire had weakened and the Indian Subcontinent was left with a great number of states, most small and weak. Many rulers accepted the offer of protection by Wellesley, as it gave them security against attack by their neighbours and rebellion by their own people. The alliance was forced upon rulers so their territories could be annexed by the British. \n\nThere are compulsions in geo-politics but those compulsion are that of geo-political nature and not because we have signed our strategic autonomy away in lump sum to be part of a bloc or a treaty organisation. \n\nFurthermore the article contradict itself when it goes on to discuss non-alignment and narrates how India, on two seperate instances successfully achieved its geo-political objectives with U.S and U.S.S.R cooperation on two seperate occassions when it suited us and when we were in need. This is what non-alignment is: flexibility to deal with other nations on our terms. \n\nTo “align” is to be forced to buy American defence system patriot instead of what we consider to be superior s400 from Russia. \n\n4. #Surgical Strike came “too soon”\n\n“*Narendra Modi too made a dramatic flourish with Nawaz Sharif and then gave up too soon.Pathankot, Gurdaspur and other betrayals happened for sure. But great leaders distinguish the tactical from the strategic.*”\n\nAny Prime Minister that will take a tough stance against Pakistan will be accused to have given up “too soon”. How soon is too soon? And by the way why are we looking at tenure of individual Prime Ministers when we should be really looking at the Pakistan policy as a whole. The trail of betrayals has a far longer list than just the three mentioned in this article. \n\nThe policy of engaging Pakistan and letting it execute one terrorist attack after another with impunity has been going on for last thirty years in which we have lost countless lives. If anything the current policy of making Pakistan pay for terrorist attacks by retaliatory action is late rather than “too soon”. \n\nSome people think letting terrorists from other country come in and kill your civilians and soldiers and taking no effective action against it is the greatest strategy there is. \n\n5. #Pakistan’s bad image in India is BJP’s doing\n\n“*As things unfolded subsequently, he and his party built their politics on anti-Pakistanism.*”\n\nAfter what all Pakistani State against India has done since independence there is no chance of having a pro-Pakistan sentiment. There is something the writer is missing. Its not that BJP has created a sentiment. The sentiment exist on the ground and BJP is honoring the will of the people. Public representative are suppose to represent people but this democratic principle is not something that Luteyen’s commentators hold dear. \n\n6. #Search for seacond “pole” in a multipolar world \n\n“*The unipolar world is now over. As is non-alignment. China is the other pole, as the Soviet Union used to be. It has no incentive in settling its borders, not even delineating the LAC with you.*”\n\nUnipolar world may have been over but this is not a bipolar world of cold war era either. To keep searching for the second “pole” in a multipolar world is a cold war era mindset with no basis in present reality. And since there are no two poles there is no need to “aligh” or in other words be subservient to one or the other super power, especially for India which did not join either bloc even at the peak of cold war, retained its strategic autonomy. \n\n\n\n7. #India can unilaterality make peace with Pakistan\n\n“*Peace between two antagonists is only possible when the bigger power wants it. For India, Xi’s China isn’t that power.*”\n\nI don’t know what Gupta is smoking but when he says peace is only possible when the bigger power wants it imply India does not want peace with Pakistan and that’s why there has been no peace between India and Pakistan. I dont want to waste words, time and effort cause everyone knows in India-Pakistan equation who wants peace and who disrupt it with terrorism. \n\nAlso if bigger power wants peace it can have it? What nonsense is that? Can you give a few examples where bigger power wanted peace and the smaller power did not and peace was achieved? No. \n\nPeace is a game played by both sides and no side can unilaterally have peace with the other. These nonsensical assumptions go unchallenegd and so I took the time and effort to dissect this article.

      <li>Title::: 'How history becomes biased'<br />Body: 'V. K. Rajwade was a veteran Marathi historian, who perhaps contributed most to shed light on Maratha history by compiling historic Marathi and Sanskrit documents and making commentaries. He wrote his commentaries in the preface, one such preface to a 17th-century manuscript called "Radha Madhav Vilas Champu", which is essentially a biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji\'s father Shahaji written by someone during his lifetime. \n\nThe following paragraph is a word to word translation of paragraph 48 of that preface.\n\n---\n\nMir Jumla was Abdullah Qutb Shah\'s vizier. He was famous for his wealth and diplomacy all over India. He attacked south Karnataka in 1652 CE. Karnataka was desired by both Adilshah and Qutbshah since it was adjacent to their realm and strategically important. Adilshah sent Shahaji from his side. Mij Jumla fought a bloody war with Shahaji after entering Karnataka, in which Mir Jumla was routed by Shahaji. Finally, Mir Jumla ran off to the fort of Gooty. Shahaji sieged the fort and Mir Jumla had to surrender and sign the treaty.  Contemporary Muslim chroniclers don\'t even mention this vastly successful campaign of Shahaji. They occasionally mention some Muslim generals of Adilshahi carried out a successful campaign with flying mentions or secondary attributes to Shahaji. The same chroniclers then complain Shahaji got stronger. Conclusion of these accounts is clear. The Muslim chroniclers did not write the painful(for them) reality of Maratha general winning wars and getting stronger.\n\n---'<br />Author: 'nanafadanavis'  id: 'hgprtm'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hgprtm/how_history_becomes_biased/</li>

The Lord instructs that one has to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Kṛṣṇa, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, is called adhyātma-cetasā. Nirāśīḥ means that one has to act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such Kṛṣṇa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the four important instructions the Lord is giving to do all kinds of work ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the eternal constitutional position of a living entity ?

They issued a statement denying any knowledge of the drug and told Ramdev to stop publicising it as a cure and ordered Patanjali to immediately submit all its research, chemical compounds of the drug, details of its trials, and the necessary permissions.  \n[https://twitter.com/AmanKayamHai\\_ET/status/1275404514514751491](https://twitter.com/AmanKayamHai_ET/status/1275404514514751491)  \n\n\nPatanjali dispensed the medicine to speculated patients and then claimed they had tested negative. These were speculated patients who had only claimed to have come in contact with a Covid-19 patient and had been quarantined. They had not been tested before this drug was actually given, so there is no way to prove that they were positive.  \n\n\nAnother claim being made is that patients are cured within 14 days when they take Coronil. Fourteen days is actually the normal incubation period for the virus, so a lot of people who are infected get cured by taking common allopathic medicines or none at all.  \n\n\nLater Patanjali replied to the AYUSH ministry, giving them the details about the composition of the medicine and the trials conducted.  \n[https://docdro.id/cYwIqQG](https://docdro.id/cYwIqQG)  \n\n\nFrom the reports, we know that Patanjali did not even bother to test the drug on the most vulnerable groups of patients, with a high morbidity rate.

As a result, NPAs rose\n\n\n\n4) What would happen if NPAs rise ? Banks would need to set aside a bigger portion of their profits as a provision. So the balance profit is lower.\n\n\n\n\n5) Lesser profit means what ? Lesser money to lend.\n\n\n\n6) Lesser money to lend means less credit. So consumers are unable to get a loan. Same goes for MSMEs, who desperately need credit.\n\n\n\n7) What would happen if consumers cannot get a loan ? Demand falls. \n\n\nHowever, it is double the trouble for MSMEs. They are crushed by the lower demand AND lower supply ( due to lack of credit on their side ). Big companies are affected mostly by just the demand side instead. \n\n\n\n\n\nWill reforms help ? \n\n\n\nYes. But it takes time for the effects to show up.

They are the ones who have been dragging this country ahead for several decades. And now, their incomes also fell ( the companies that is, not the salaried class ) due to lower demand from the rest of the population.\n\n\n\nThis is the price we pay for neglecting investment in education ever since independence and just throwing money into social welfare schemes.

      <li>Title::: 'A New Additional International Financial System Established By Sanction Countries &amp; Asia Will End The Current World Madness'<br />Body: '**A New Additional International Financial System Established By Sanction Countries &amp; Asia Will End The Current World Madness**  \n \n\nThere is a way can easily defeat the US Dollar &amp; the Euro with a special strategy.  \n There is absolutely no way for the USA and the West to erase sanctions or have any change to end the current modern slave. So it is better for all the “slave” nations to setup an new additional international financial system to compete with the IMF.  \n \n\nAll the current sanction countries such as North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, etc. and the Asia should setup a brand new start-up global financial system.  \n \n\n**An example of the new one can defeat the US Dollar, Euro is here:**  \n \\- Currency rate will based on the inflation rate of each nations and be observed carefully via the other nations, and only change once per week or per month. The final inflation rate will be the result of average rate reported from each other member nations.  \n \\- All nations will have to setup a new office to receive report about local government corruption and observe the inflation rates in all other nations. All nations will have the new set minimum base note.  \n \\- There will be a trading limit and restriction rule like if reach 1000 dollar per person then that nation will receive a warning, if reach 2000 dollar of import goods then will not allowed to import goods any more but still allow export good, the restriction will lift only your nations debt within the new system back to under 1000 dollar per person.  \n \\- All the foreign currency exchange rate via commercial banks will use a same official rates, no any additional rate and random set by each banks like the current one.  \n \\- Each nation in the new financial block will have their own rule own permission about how to deal with the other nations from the IMF or any new other financial system.  \n \n\nA currency is always backed by a government and is tell you the stable and life of any nations.  \n But now if you can have a new organization like above then your national currency value will skyrocketing because it will be backed by many nations as well and via the most fair rule which is the inflation rate.  \n \n\nImagine a new financial organization with Japan, new China, Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mongolia, which mean all the member currency will backed by over 2 billions people and will going to crush the current US dollar backed by oil and the Euro back by over 500 billions people. And that is just a small Eastern Asia region, if including the West Asia then that will be nearly 4 billion people.  \n \n\nThat is the way to defeat the US dollar &amp; the Euro.  \n You do not need gold-backed currency because the most powerful is the knowledge-backed currency.  \n A new virtual invisible government with a virtual currency combine a lot of small individual currencies, what a great strategy !  \n \n\nAll the sanctioned nations and the Asia have nothing to lose, they should kick off the great life reset.  \n As long as using only knowledge to fight, but not the Gold physical threat like the North Korea are doing, then it will be perfectly ok for the West.  \n \n\nHello the Asia the East, if you want to this special strategy, you must get the permission from me the Savior first in advance.  \n \n\nBest Regard,  \n **The Savior Messiah Kalki Maitreya Buddha Anyname**'<br />Author: 'Sunair_resort'  id: 'hgkr9u'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hgkr9u/a_new_additional_international_financial_system/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indians attribute all good qualities to education. In fact it is the semi-educated but vital people that lead the world. A highly educated man achieves nothing but academia and prizes. Validate this raw truth with examples.'<br />Body: "What is the appeal of a Tom Cruise (Dyslexic), a Rapper (50-cent, Eminem) or a Trump or Modi?\n\nThey all act much more like a primal alpha male than an intellectual one.\n\nOther famous Dyslexics are Jim Carrey, Richard Branson, John Lennon, Mohammed Ali. Narendra Modi and John F Kennedy had no formal education. So did a legion of Business successes - John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Ingvar Kamprad, Soichiro Honda, Steve Jobs...the list is endless. Among musicians a lack of formal education is the norm.\n\nWhat is gained in the name of education? Do we offer any education of life? Do we teach the art of life? Not at all. We teach some second hand ideas, new terms, diagrams, concepts and equations. All second hand, none of arose in the student as a genuine question, the questions were not asked but the answers were given. An educated man ends up with a great pile of words and passed down ideas… has no other wealth of his owns. He is as ignorant of real life as any uneducated person but with one difference - that is his illusion that he is not an idiot. He has no understanding whatsoever about the art of living, he has no idea of the paths along his real talents might flower in unexpected directions.\n\nSuch an education, accumulation of books read, the wealth of debate becomes a weight on the brain but neither does it make the brain free, nor alive, nor thoughtful, nor does it provide any originality in looking at life, nor does it inspire the art of living or teach ways of living. So far, this is what we have been calling education.\n\nThose who are semi-educated (**self educated, no formal education - I do not mean the uneducated)** \\- they are more alive, they have more vitality, are more charged with possibility. Charting your own path (as an actor, a musician or a politician)is uncertain and full of risk for many educated people. It is an unfamiliar zone. It requires courage to live from your instincts, because in charting your own path nothing is familiar, everything is fresh, like a bird flying through the air, there is no road on the map to follow. It is an open space. To launch into it, you need real courage. This breeds risk taking and courage as the fibre of character and teaches lessons of life that formal education does not offer. On the track of education, and more higher education there is a comfortable, a mundane and familiar intellect....there is a known career path, known results...and mediocrity.\n\nDyslexics can't focus on the written word for a long time, musicians on a stage and demagogue politicans wield disproportionate power because their life lessons are drawn from observing people first hand. They describe our complex world in simple terms and tell us that actually there's a simple problem with a simple solution, and we should choose them to fix things.\n\nThat's the secret of Dyslexics, Rappers, Politicians - the raw, semi-educated, vital man - they take simple ideas and pour enormous energy into them, while the educated are aware of things that have been tried and retreats into doubt, he does not explore, believing it to be a lost cause. It is a conflict between raw energy and simple solutions vs breadth of knowledge and an underappreciation for the energy required for success.\n\nDoes this mean I am advocating a lack of education? No, all the examples are of those who are semi-educated, self educated or had no formal education. It is not lack of knowledge or education that is the problem, but that overeducation for 10-15 years causes one to lose vitality, diminishing our capability and risk taking and flirt with the unknown in the prime years of life.\n\nThe inability to read and therefore pile on degrees like one is instructed to do is a gift in disguise. **Those who are educated can hardly think of anything new. They just go one dissecting ideas with more ideas. Any problem in life - they rummage their memory for existing solutions to such a problem. They are like a closed circuit. They are stuck in patterns of the past, they ask no vital questions. They are dogmatic. The overeducated have fixed ideas and they defend them tenaciously instead of being open.**\n\nDedicating oneself to 10-15 years in pursuits of fancy degrees and PhDs and Doctorates leads to a very extended period of breaking touch with the core essence of our life through overeducation. If we look at the educated man with unbiased eyes it is is difficult because we are also educated men, so it is with great difficulty that we are able to see an educated man’s diseases. Where there is the same disease prevalent all over the place, it is very difficult to recognize it.\n\nVitality, fearlessness, raw energy and an instinctive sense of power to wield the torch of change are much more important than fancy degrees and impressive academic credentials."<br />Author: 'SirByron'  id: 'hg9g7p'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hg9g7p/indians_attribute_all_good_qualities_to_education/</li>

As expected, it had more than 10k upvotes ; which is not really surprising considering that any negative news about India tends to have a huge number of upvotes.\n\nLooking at the comments, I could see so many people(especially Americans) saying extremely racist and hateful things like Indians are  millenia backward, all Indians are criminals, rapists etc. And to top it off, even some Indians saying that Indian men are all misogynists and potential rapists. \nI agree that Indian does have a big problem with misogyny and crimes on women, but all of us are trying to slowly eradicate it, aren't we?And which country doesn't have the same problems?\n \nIt was also quite ironic to see the Americans criticizing India in a very xenophobic manner; a country known for its very huge ratio of sexual offense per capita which has also received a lot of flak over its discrimination and killing of Blacks and Browns. Not to mention NZ and Australia, known for their rampant racism towards immigrants (Indians/blacks especially) and natives. The Christchurch shooting  is a clear representation of that.\n\nI'm sorry if I got carried away, but what I wanted to say is that we have to work for the improvement of issues troubling our society so that such incidents like the one in Chattisgarh do not happen in the future.

      <li>Title::: 'Experience of doing business in India vs China by an Indian Manufacturer'<br />Body: "**I am the Vice President  of a medium sized Indian corporate**.  We are one of the largest manufacturers of Drum Closures in the world.  These are a closing devices used in the manufacture of 200 litres Steel drums.  It is a very high precision engineering product.  We are also one of the largest  manufacturers and exporters of scaffolding system out of India.  These are also highly engineered precision products.\n\nIt is a common practice in these days in the business circles to **compare India and China in almost all spheres**.  In every forum or platform the discussion inevitably veered around China - India comparison. In this article, **I want to share the  experience  of   starting and operating business in China**.  You may make your own comparison with the conditions in India based on your own experience .  **I am a patriot to the core and am no fan of China**.  However the business and economic considerations compelled our group  to consider putting up a factory in China for producing drum closures and scaffolding for Chinese and international markets.  We considered the availability of cheaper raw material, highly productive labour, very low logistic cost and good sized domestic market in China as the reasons enough to invest in a factory in China.\n\nWe were aware about **volatile Indo-Chinese relations** and the risk involved in operating in China.  They have some **typical laws and their legal system tend to favour Chinese**.  We had developed high level of indigenous manufacturing technology which is economic and competitive.  There was also fear of Chinese learning and copying our technology. In spite of all these fears we decided to go ahead by taking reasonable precautions.  We decided not to take any Chinese partner.  Apart from the fear of  loss of technology there is also a law in China that Chinese citizen holding minority interest also has a veto power in the company.  **Hence we decided to go on our own.**\n\nIn 2006 we started searching for a suitable location.  We wanted to be close to East Coast but in a location where the labour was cheaper than the developed eastern provinces and the laws permitted generation and disposal of effluent.\n\nIn 2008 after many discussions and considerations we located an Industrial Zone Quanjiao  in a small town about 50 km west of Nanjing which met most of our requirements.  After obtaining initial information about the zone, we decided to meet zone authorities  personally and  to see the area .  I and one of my colleagues reached the zone office in the morning at about 10.00 AM.  **To our surprise we found that the zone authorities had made elaborate arrangements to welcome us.  Local party chief and few other senior officials were also present**. We felt awed and nervous.  We told the zone head that we had visited  only for a survey and do not have a plan to sign any deal.  The zone chief informed  very politely that they were sure that we would be satisfied with the land and the conditions.\n\nThey then explained  their proposals and showed  various sites in the zone.  After we showed our interest in a piece of land they made a final offer which was substantially more attractive than the offer made in the mail earlier.  We asked for few more facilities which they readily agreed **and after about 4 hours the deal was signed**. We were  amazed at their helpful and cordial approach all through the discussions and **their determination to get first foreigner to invest in their industrial zone**.\n\n After signing a short MOU , we informed them that we need to go to Nanjing and speak to a lawyer to form a company.  The zone chief mentioned that if we have trust in them they would form the company **with all approvals free of cost**.  By this time we had already started trusting them and  agreed to their proposal.  They had also got a local Bank Manager with all the necessary forms for opening the bank account.  **All this in a day's work!**\n\n**Within a week** we got company registration with the name and registration number and the company documents were given to us **within 2 weeks**.  The bank account was opened within one week thereafter.  Hence within less than one month we were  able to buy the land with all the registration and approvals  and also open the bank account.\n\n**One officer in the zone was nominated to give us all the required assistance**.  We mentioned about the need for an architect.  Promptly he gave us names of about 5 architects who were already active in the zone.  After some discussions with architects we finalized one  from Nanjing and gave him details of  the building  requirements.  We once again approached the officer of the zone  for help to find  some contractors for construction.  Within one day he give list of 8 or 9 civil contractors who were doing construction activities in the zone.  We floated the enquiry to all the contractors and finalized one of them.\n\n**The building was constructed in about 4 months and in 6 months time we were able to start the production.  In my last 30 years of experience in India I  have yet to see a factory starting within 6 months.**\n\n**We have been in production for last 10 years and are quite satisfied with our working in China**.  I would now like to share some of my experiences of operation in China.  \n\n1)   Even though the labor wages are higher than India, **the cost per piece works out to be cheaper because of high productivity of the labor.**\n\n2)   The zone we selected is located in a small town with a population only about 1,50,000.  The zone was also one of the **most ordinary typical industrial zone of China**.  In spite of this the **internal road of the zone are wide, concreted with shady trees on both sides, good landscaping and very clean and organized.  The zone offer 5 basic services of providing electricity, water and sewerage connections at the factory gate, levelled land and road connectivity.  I have yet to see an industrial estate of similar quality and services anywhere in India.**\n\n3)   The workers are provided free lunch every day by the company.   This is the common practice in China.\n\n4)   Every year during Chinese New Year all the business in China remain closed for 10 days.  Apart from these there are few holidays during Labour day in May ,National Day in October , Dragon boat festival in June. **There is no PL,CL system**.\n\n5)   The factory laws in China is very well defined and there is **no room for any discretion**.  The 5 star Insurance is compulsory for each and  every employee which covers Endowment , Accident ,Unemployment , maternity/paternity and hospitalization .  For the compensation for injury during working is well confined depending on the nature of injury.  **The compliance of factory rules are done once at the time completion of construction and then there is no further inspection**.  In fact during our more than 10 years operations **we do not have any inspector visiting our factory for any reason.**\n\n6)   We submit VAT returns online every month and every month our VAT refund due is credited.  **There is no human interaction or any failure**. In fact no one can issue Invoice which they call Fapio with their own logo or style . Each and every seller has to by pre-printed Invoice/Fapio from the Sales Tax department and can issue only those Invoices to their customers. Seller has to buy one devise from tax department which gets connected between computer and printer and **data gets transferred to tax department automatically**.\n\n7)   There is a very high degree of safety and security and **there is no theft**.\n\n8)   There are **no aggressive unions**.  In fact the wages and benefits are well defined and **there are no negotiations**.  The working is peaceful.  **There is no political or bureaucratic intervention**. After every Chinese New  year, **our area's Mayor visits our factory with entire HOD of departments like Electricity ,Labour,Zone etc. to discuss on any issues if faced by us.This is amazing.**\n\n9)   All the government offices are fully accountable.  If any application for any license or permit is not settled in 30 days then the **same is deemed to be approved.**\n\n10) In spite of Indo-Chinese tensions from time to time due to situation in the borders the Chinese workers and staff are very cordial and friendly.  They are all aware about the tensions but it has not affected our or any other Indian establishment.\n\n11)  There are no other taxes or dues except VAT, Income Tax, Custom Duty and local taxes.  These are all well-defined and there is no room for disputes.  All assessments are done online.\n\n12) **The government of China response very quickly to changing international situation.  For example when President Trump slapped 10% Custom Duty on Chinese products, within one week government of China increased the VAT rebate by 4% and also devalued their currency .  Thereby nullifying the custom duty in US and at the same time making Chinese goods more competitive in the rest of the world.  This is their usual speed of response.**\n\nThese are some of cuff observations of operating in China.  **Clearly China has unmatched ease of starting business as well as ease of doing business**.  It is because of this  combination that the invisible **transaction cost are almost NIL in China**.  This propagates downstream and upstream  giving **over all competitiveness to the Chinese products.**\n\n**If the Government of India follow the China model of ease of starting business and doing business then I am sure India can overtake China as world manufacturing hub because intrinsically Indian entrepreneur  is more seasoned, matured and experienced than Chinese counterpart.**\n\n*JAI HIND !!!*\n\n------------------\nBest Regards &amp; Wishes,\n \n**Deepak Mishra\nVice - President**\nTechnocraft Industries (India) Ltd."<br />Author: 'TheReal_Skywalker'  id: 'hg3m7k'<br />Score:125<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hg3m7k/experience_of_doing_business_in_india_vs_china_by/</li>

But the wise should not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers' lack of knowledge.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nPersons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called mandān, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant men think of the body as the self; bodily connections with others are accepted as kinsmanship; the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship; and the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves. Social work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one's own spiritual activities silently.\n\nMen who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human being.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the characteristics of an ignorant man bewildered by the modes of material nature ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p3mu85m07751.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08589c8c50c1e9ee09e1c3355632122193fc85bb\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'hg1zg0'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hg1zg0/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is329/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'From Kipling: It is always a temptation to an armed and agile nation To call upon a neighbour and to say: "We invaded you last night--we are quite prepared to fight, Unless you pay us cash to go away."'<br />Body: 'India’s bilateral trade with China has been a one-way street, for many years, and it’s been “Advantage China” all the way.\n\n\n\n2001-2002: India $951.95 million to China’s $2.036 billion\n\n2002-2003: India $1.975 billion to China’s $2.792 billion\n\n2003-2004: India $2.955 billion to China $4.053 billion\n\n2004-2005: India $5.615 billion to China $7.097 billion\n\n2005-2006: India $6.759 billion to China $10.868 billion\n\n2006-2007: India $8.321 billion to China $17.475 billion\n\n2007-2008: India $10.871 billion to China $27.146 billion\n\n2008-2009: India $9.353 billion to China $32.497 billion\n\n2009-2010: India $11.617 billion to China $30.824 billion\n\n2010-2011: India $14.168 billion to China $43.479 billion\n\n2011-2012: India $18.076 billion to China $55.313 billion\n\n2012-2013: India $13.534 billion to China $52.248 billion\n\n2013-2014: India $14.824 billion to China $51.034 billion\n\nIt’s clear that the real thrust to Sino-Indian bilateral trade began in 1999-2000, and from the start it was “Advantage China” and “Disadvantage India”.\n\nOne wonders what made the Indian government ignore this huge imbalance for so long. \n\n&gt;The irony is that whereas India’s bilateral trade deficit was bad from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 (varying between $743.85 million in 1999-2000 to $1,482 billion in 2004-05), the year-on-year Chinese surplus figure never exceeded the $2 billion mark. Against that, India’s deficit (or the Chinese surplus) started becoming unmanageable and alarming from 2005-06, when it touched a record $4.108 billion. The adverse trend kept increasing from then on.\n\n&gt;In 2010-11, it went into negative territory, touching minus $29.31 billion and then kept on going downhill: in 2011-12 $37.23 billion; in 2012-13 $38.74 billion and in 2013-14 it was $36.21 billion. Then in 2014-15, the gap shot up to $48.479 billion. The figure was $52.696 in 2015-16 while in 2016-17 it marginally dropped to $51.110 billion.\n\n&gt;The most alarming fact is that the value of Indian exports either stagnated or declined. Thus whereas India’s exports to China in 2013-14 stood at $14.824 billion, it declined to $11.934 billion in 2014-15; $9.010 billion in 2015-16, and marginally rising to $10.171 billion in 2016-17.\n\nThe question arises: why have Indian exports steadily fallen over the years? \n\nAre we taking the “easier route” of “import for internal trading” at the expense of our indigenous industrial production, factory expansion and employment generation? Are we unwittingly taking recourse to what the United States did over three decades ago? The US then depended on comparatively cheap mass-produced fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), manufactured by Western as well as joint-venture Chinese corporations based in China, which sent the goods from there to the US. At that time, the US imported huge amounts of goods from China to avoid buying “comparatively expensive” American goods.\n\nIs India making the same mistake now? Is the cost of goods taking precedence over quality?\n\nBut in the long run, India has no alternative but to adopt a course correction — both for the health of the economy as well as to ensure political survival.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that the situation is alarming. Why? Because the Chinese are investing $52 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), passing through our territory in Jammu and Kashmir under the illegal occupation of Pakistan and China.\n\nCan it then be said that the entire CPEC investment money in our own territory is being sourced from India? Is India unknowingly, but indirectly, funding a cause which it deems to be a violation of its sovereignty? Is it incorrect to suggest or ask: “Is India scoring a same-side goal under the banner of Sino-Indian bilateral trade?” Only for the sake of so-called Chinese goodwill?\n\nThere is one factor which is too conspicuous to be ignored. The entire Sino-Indian bilateral trade appears to be between a country supplying cheap raw material (India) and a nation that is an industrial goods manufacturer (China), which could be likened to Lenin’s famous quote on imperialism being the highest stage of capitalism, in which the industrial nations send their finished goods (at a fat profit) to consumers who had earlier exported the raw material to produce it. Low-cost raw material ending with high-priced finished goods results in an adverse trade balance for India!\n\nLet’s see what India imports from China and what it exports to that country. Indian exports to China include iron ore, cotton yarn, granite and natural stone, plastic raw material, bulk minerals and ores, human hair, pearl, precious, semi-precious stones, finished leather, marine products, electronic components, etc.\n\nChina’s exports to India include telecom instrument, electronic components, computer hardware peripherals, organic chemicals, consumer electronics, electronic instruments, electric machinery and equipment, airconditioners, refrigeration machinery, products of iron and steel, project goods, aluminium products, cranes, lifts and winches, machine tools, accumulators and batteries and moulded and extruded goods.\n\nEven before moving into the White House, US President Donald Trump has been crying hoarse about his country’s adverse trade balance vis-a-vis China, but it is doubtful how far, or how much, he will be able to do anything to reverse the situation. India, however, hasn’t yet reached the position where America stands today. Does India really want to fall to that position? Will it do any good to a nation of 1.26 billion? Should India remain a nation of eternal trade deficit even in the 21st century?\n\nhttps://www.asianage.com/opinion/oped/290318/india-china-trade-deficit-risingclose-the-gap-before-its-too-late.html'<br />Author: 'Sea_Shrimps'  id: 'hg1wuc'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hg1wuc/from_kipling_it_is_always_a_temptation_to_an/</li>

He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and that his position should not be in the material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme, who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. He therefore engages himself in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different features-namely Brahman, Paramātmā, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead-is called tattvavit, for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.\n\n**Question 1 : Who is called a tattvavit ?**\n\n**Question 2 : How one can get detached from the activities of material senses ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/tmsmi9nw21751.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fe9da93f683071d6e2a8aebf2cf871598b7ee75)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'hfjdjv'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hfjdjv/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is328/</li>

However, if you dig in deeper, you could see subtle fault lines in the color spectrum. For example, when an Indian person is noticeably lighter-skinned than the majority, there\'s a higher chance that he/she has a different political or religious belief from the majority. The same goes to someone in the very dark spectrum\n\nMaybe that\'s why people who live in the regions of Punjab and Kashmir have over time developed a noticeably different identity to those in the Hindi belt. Maybe that\'s also why a lot of Dalits and Tamils, who are noticeably darker than other Indians have a high percentage of their community who identify as Christians. \n\nI think what\'s happening here is an identity crisis that led to identity separation. **"*****They look different to me and my family, could they be my people?

The Allahabad High Court held then Prime Minister **Indira Gandhi**   to be guilty of corrupt electoral practices and disqualified her from   contesting elections for 6 years. After she was not granted a total  stay  by the Supreme Court, Gandhi imposed national Emergency upon the   country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Raj  Narain files election petition in April 1971 before the Allahabad High Court.**\n\nRaj  Narain, influenced by the rumour  about chemical treatment of ballot  papers amongst other grounds of  corrupt electoral practices, filed an  election petition in April 1971  through advocate **Ramesh Chandra Shrivastava** before the Allahabad High Court. He engaged Senior advocate **Shanti Bhushan** \\[then a member of INC (O)\\] to represent him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**June  12, 1975 Indira Gandhi was found to  have indulged in corrupt  practices**\n\nThe  judgment was pronounced on  June  12, 1975. Indira Gandhi was found to  have indulged in corrupt  practices on account of rostrums constructed by  government officers and  that her election agent Yashpal Kapoor worked  at her instance in the  election while being a gazetted officer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Indira Gandhi appeals in SC for stay**\n\nGandhi   appealed before the Supreme Court. As summer vacations were running,   the appeal came to be presented before the vacation judge – Justice **VR Krishna Iyer**.   At that time, the vacation judge, unlike today, sat only on Tuesdays   and Fridays. On June 20, the Advocate-on-Record for Gandhi, **JB Dadachandji**, mentioned the matter for an early date. The date of hearing was fixed on the coming Monday i.e. June 23.\n\nAfter   hearing the arguments on stay application, Justice Krishna Iyer   reserved judgment and pronounced the same on the next day, June 24, at   3:45pm. After hearing Shanti Bhushan and **Nani Palkhivala** (for Gandhi), a [conditional stay was granted](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1240174/), but it was clarified that there was no legal embargo on Indira Gandhi continuing as the Prime Minister.\n\n# The next day after Indira Gandhi got stay from a vacation Judge. President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed had declared national Emergency.\n\n**Leaders arrested**\n\nJune  24, 1975, at midnight, political leaders of the opposition  including  Jai Prakash Narayan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Morarji  Desai,  and Charan Singh were picked up and lodged in jails and at 10 AM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A small story that took place in  Ramlila Maida**\n\nIt was past 9 pm and the night  had got colder although the rain had  stopped. I said to a colleague from the  Hindustan Times that I thought  people might start to leave unless somebody said  something more  inspirational. “Don’t worry,” he replied with a smile, “nobody  will  leave until Atalji speaks. Everyone here has come just to hear him.” He   pointed to a small man with steel-grey hair, the last speaker that  evening.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he is the best  orator in India.  Have you never heard him speak?”\n\n“No. I’ve only been in  journalism since he went to jail.”\n\n“Well, you’re in for a treat.  And to hear him for the first time today will really be something.”\n\nIt was well past 9.30 pm when  Atalji’s turn finally came and as he rose to speak the huge crowd stood up and  started to clap.\n\nHe paused.

Some would say that this habit extends to the workspace where it's always the boss's fault.\n\nSomeone needs to tell the vast majority of Indians who indulge in this habit that **blaming others almost always never solves your problem.** For example, if you blame your local govt for shortage of ICU beds for COVID patients, what do you expect the outcome to be? For the govt to apologize and buy beds immediately? You tell when has this ever happened? \n\nPerhaps that's why India still is in such a despotic state. When people complain about everything, nothing gets done. The politicians or administrators who get things done will never come to power because its impossible for them to satisfy the masses, those who come to power are clever people who say one thing and do another thing."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'hevcmm'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hevcmm/do_indians_have_a_problem_of_perpetually_blaming/</li>

The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of Kṛṣṇa.

He does not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Hṛṣīkeśa, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa.\n\n**Question 1 : Why a spirit soul forgets his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What are the symptoms of ignorance originating from false ego in a person ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/vxyumt18ks651.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f6ffc7ec1b375fa06a23004e2b7b7161f21c66)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'heute5'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/heute5/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is327/</li>

The cultures and religions that they had developed are too numerous to be named here alone but most, if not all, were *animalist* and different tribes had different names for their gods/god, spirits, rituals etc but not all worshiped the same gods/god or had the same beliefs. In terms of culture, they had settled long enough to diverge far from the tribes that first settled on those hills. Like the many tribes of Kukis/Mizos and Nagas. They have different dialects and cultural backgrounds but it cannot be denied that many diverged from one main tribe.  \n\nIt is evident that these tribes' religions were never apart of the Hindu beliefs of Dharma which hold other religions together nor of the Indian culture as they had indigenously developed their own and yes, most are Christian nowadays and lost much of their culture but they still keep it alive and protect it through the many festivals they have, like the Chapcharkut in Mizoram and The Hornbill Festival in Nagaland.\n\nSo, the questions are :\n\n* Should Hinduvita apply to these tribes that were never Hindus in the past and won't it be hypocritical to convert them? \n* Won't Hinduism drive their cultures farther into extinction as their festivals and rituals they still practice today require sacrificial cow slaughters and feasts of beef?\n* Will Hinduism incorporate their old religion as Christianity have, like the use drums made from genuine cow leather in Church services as was once used in their rituals of their old religions or their religious dances."<br />Author: 'Xhe_Me'  id: 'hetrxm'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hetrxm/what_of_the_previous_tribal_animalists_in_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In my Name'<br />Body: 'The last thing he saw was not the sky. it was a streaming swarm of shoulders blocking out the light, the occasional swinging palm or fist, sometimes a stick, raining blows all over his body. Then he turned around, face down, and it was all black. Perhaps he caught a glimpse of the pavement tinged crimson before he slipped into the never-ending darkness. Perhaps he didn\'t. His lips will never tell the tale. The tale that went back several centuries. The tale of the name he carried by the cruelest twist of fate, the cruelest irony that history has in store. \n\nThe name of his forefathers, of those who had come before him. Those who had resisted. Those who had fought in vain. Never the victors but forever defiant. Still standing strong even in their small numbers, honouring the Gods of their ancestors, keeping the fire of tradition lit through the bitter cold of the harshest winters for century after century. \n\nThere were those who were vanquished. They succumbed, they changed who they were and in-turn worked to vanquish everything their forefathers had built. Erasing themselves, but still they carried the same name. \n\nAnd so they carried on. The natives and the vanquishers in their dance of death and destruction. The vanquishers swelled their ranks with every passing sally. The natives fled, lest they be forced to join the ranks of the vanquishers to carry forward the never-ending cycle of erasure, the new cycle that the former natives participated in with renewed zeal. The vanquished became the vanquishers, but not in the way of a reversal of fortunes. The vanquished mirrored and mimicked the vanquishers, adopted their ways. A generation is all it takes for an entire lineage to be forgotten forever. They may carry the same name, but their hearts change forever. \n\nYet there were those who resisted this cycle of destruction. Those who still carried the names of their forefathers with pride. They prayed to the new God, for there is no God but Him. But they held no hate for the natives who still went about their old ways. Only a handful of natives remained, and among the vanquishers, only a handful of sympathisers existed. Those sympathisers who were brave enough to say, "I may face the same way when I pray, but I refuse to despise those who do not." Standing up to your own is always harder than standing up to the others. \n\nHe was a sympathiser. He believed in the noblest of human qualities - empathy, love, brotherhood. He longed for peace, an end to the cycle of violence that had consumed him and his brothers for generations. The violence that had assaulted his forefathers once. He still carried their name, but hardly a memory of their ways. But he certainly carried their spirit. \n\nBut even the distant memory of the ways of the land was despised by the vanquishers. They hated above all, the sympathisers. So they did what they had done for centuries. Perhaps by sheer force of habit at the sound of his name, they gathered in the hundreds, bludgeoned him and vanquished him. \n\nVanquished, but not forever. Despair not, he will be reborn. For death is not the end, merely the beginning of the next birth. In this land, we are born again. \n\n\\- My (fictional) tribute to Deputy Superintendent Mohammed Ayub Pandith, who was lynched to death 3 years back on June 22nd while doing his duty.

      <li>Title::: 'How China strategises'<br />Body: 'In this post I am going to write down an editorilized article  on *Iain Johnston\'s* book, C**ultural Realism**.The author of the book is one of the foremost researcher on how strategies are percieved by China. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe excerpts are below\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Johnston, a young political scientist at Harvard, decided to test this premise of a uniquely Chinese, essentially pacific strategic culture,rooted in the Confucian-Mencian disparagement of the use of force.His methodology combines excruciatingly close textual analysis of the Seven Military Classics of ancient China, still a part of Chinese military discourse, with study of Ming dynasty (1368-1644) foreign-policy decisions"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Johnston defines "strategic culture" as "ranked grand strategic preferences derived from central paradigmatic assumptions about the nature of conflict and the enemy, and collectively shared by decision makers."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In the Seven Military Classics, Johnston finds evidence of two strategic cultures.     \n\n1.  There was a Confucian-Mencian-based set of assumptions and preferences for policies dependent on diplomacy and economic incentives, or on winning over one\'s foes through self-improvement and the example of Chinese rectitude, but it was largely symbolic, used primarily to justify behavior in culturally acceptable ways.\n2. This was augmented by an operational set of assumptions and policy preferences indistinguishable from the realpolitik practiced by much of the rest of the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ancient Chinese writers on strategy invariably concluded that the best way to respond to a threat was to eliminate it by force.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Johnston contends that the Chinese classics stressed the value of violent solutions to security conflicts and of offensive over defensive strategies. Negotiations were a device for delaying action until the moment was auspicious. The goal would remain annihilation of the enemy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* He concludes that there was no pacifist bias in the Chinese strategic tradition but only realpolitik sometimes cloaked in Confucian-Mencian rationalizations.\n* His analysis of 120 memorials written by various Ming officials at various times notes the relative absence of references to Confucian-Mencian symbols and a conviction that the Mongols, the principal threat to the dynasty during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, must be met with force.\n* **The application of military power was deemed essential to maintain Chinese credibility.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Johnston leaves little doubt that Ming leaders, well versed in traditional strategic thought, consistently **chose war** whenever they believed that Chinese power was adequate to defeat their adversaries\n* Study by Jonathan Wilkenfield, Michael Brecher, and Sheila Moser that indicates that the PRC, involved in eleven foreign-policy crises from 1950 to 1985, *resorted to violence in eight of them, or 72 percent of the time.*\n* China, Johnston argues, is much more likely than other states to use force in territorial disputes, partly because of historical sensitivity to threats to China\'s territorial integrity.\n* **It is more likely to be confrontational as it grows stronger.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Now here comes the big surprise this article was written in 1997, so read the following excerpt in the context of that and judge for yourself .***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If Johnston\'s analysis of China\'s strategic culture is correct -- generational change will not guarantee a kinder, gentler China. \n* **The powerful China we have every reason to expect in the twenty-first century is likely to be as aggressive and expansionist as China has been whenever it has been the dominant power in Asia -- except when its leaders have reason to believe that potential adversaries have both the power and the determination to stop them.**\n\nSource  --&gt; [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/03/chinas-strategic-culture/376815/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/03/chinas-strategic-culture/376815/)'<br />Author: 'justlurking_here'  id: 'heez44'<br />Score:35<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/heez44/how_china_strategises/</li>

All rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the Vedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study the Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of Kṛṣṇa. The learned Kṛṣṇa conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities, still, a slightly developed Kṛṣṇa conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the prescribed duties of a particular person.\n\n**Question 1 : What is the duty of a realized soul in Kṛṣṇa consciousness towards the conditioned souls ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Why a person directly working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness doesn't need to follow Vedic rituals ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/68g63tmjhm651.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6dcdd6a0debb52e2e651fe4f72a48f4a0c77676)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'heb052'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/heb052/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is326/</li>

But that doesn\'t mean this is a failure by any measure. We can spread that around the world and India through this means. \n\nI understand many of you will find loopholes or shortcomings of this, which is good, and I welcome them.

They're so disillusioned and are literally devotees of Winnie the Pooh (Xi Jinping).\n\nI will quote a few examples:\n\n•They believed the Chinese govt that NO Chinese casualties were there during the Galwan valley face off. Though now the world knows there are many more not just limited to a high ranking officer.\n\n•According to their sources,it was originally India who entered their territory and attacked the Chinese.\n\n•All their posts regarding India say that we can't boycott Chinese products.India will not be able to survive without them.\nThey are proud of the fact that 70% of mobiles in India are Chinese.This might be partly true but I don't think it's like we can't just get rid of them.It might take some time but isn't it possible in the long run ?Australia is slowly moving towards it.So can we.\n\nAfter all Chinese imports are just 3% of our total imports.\n\n•The protests in Honk Kong and Taiwan are just done by miscreants who don't want to work and want free money from mainland China.They call them lazy and good for nothing.\n\n•They seem to be very proud of their copy paste engineering and feel like no foreign power can match them. And they feel the Chinese military is the best(take with a huge resentment towards the West specially USA).\n\n•They are living in some weird delusion where they feel China is the current world leader and a superpower. And if it wanted it could occupy India or any other country for that matter with ease.\n\n•They openly boast how they've pretty much bought all the neighbouring countries of India ( think Nepal,Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) and how the sponsored terrorists from these countries are doing such a great job at destabilising India.\n\n•It seems there's something like a Chinese dream where they aim to conquer the whole world.A lot of their posts hint at how China had been secretly increasing its power and waiting silently like a cunning predator until the whole world is dependent on them. Then surprise the whole world and take it over step by step.It's something in their values and textbooks with someone even linking it to Mao Zedong!\n\nBut the people there also seem to think that Winnie the Pooh showed his cards to the world a little early. They were still not that advanced and powerful that they could realise their dream. Which might cause their plans to backfire.\n\n•The Uighur Muslims were not killed or anything. They just call that modernising which is for the betterment of China. And they openly feel harvesting organs from them is justified.\n\nAnd then there's their hypocritical stand where they say the Americans and Australians screwed up their respective marginalised communities but China supports them.\n\n•They believe China is in no way responsible for Corona virus. They are openly challenging the fact that they didn't buy the WHO and told it about the virus when it was already too late.\nAnd the funny part is they are blaming Europe and America for the virus.\n\n•They appreciate how generous the CCP is by giving loans to poor nations which can never repay them back. And then China simply asks the country to give their ports/trade routes in return as repayment or pretty much buys the entire country. Nice strategy China.\n\nThis list would be endless.I am literally getting sick typing this.\n\nIf you want to really have an insight into what the people on the other side of the border think about the world and India in general,have a look at r/sino.\n\nDon't blame me if you die laughing or feel sorry for the naive people out there.I know we have our own set of problems but it'll take some time to solve it.But the brainwashed 1.4 billion Chinese are so detached from reality that it looks like they live in a different world altogether.

      <li>Title::: 'Question for the people who have read the book "Pakistan or Partition of India" by BR Ambedkar'<br />Body: '**So I havent read the entire book yet, but from so far what I have read,** I feel like its largely biased.\n\nIn the very beginning, the author claims that he is putting out views from the both side and provides analytical presentation without prejudice, however, I largely felt that its written as though he is trying to justify the creation of pakistan, the views from the muslim side are put forth, mostly supported, and where he didnt support, he somehow turned it into criticizing the congress for their politics, and regarding the Hindu views, he goes at great lengths to explain how they are baseless, illogical, not feasible, creating a dangerous situation and what not. Why I think so is because,\n\n**Savarkar\'s views:**\n\n**On Swaraj:**\n\n\\&gt;Swaraj to the Hindus must mean only that in which their" Swaraj ", their " Hindutva " can assert itself without being overlorded by any non-Hindu people, whether they be Indian Territorials or extra-Territorials—-some Englishmen are and may continue to be territorially born Indians. Can, therefore, the overlordships of these Anglo-indians be a " Swarajya " to the Hindus ? Aurangzeb or Tipu were hereditary Indians, nay, were the sons of converted Hindu mothers. Did that mean that the rule of Aurangzeb or Tipu was a "Swarajya" to the Hindus ? No !\xa0 Although they were territorially Indians they proved to be the worst enemies of Hindudom and therefore, a Shivaji, a Gobindsingh, a Pratap or the Peshwas had to fight against the Moslem domination and establish real Hindu Swarajya.\n\nHe also was strongly in favor to keep the name of the country as Hindustan, and wanted Hindi, Sanskrit and Nagari script compulsory.\n\n**Savakar on position on non minorites under Swaraj:**\n\n\\&gt;When once the Hindu Maha Sabha not only accepts but maintains the principles of" one man one vote " and the public services to go by merit alone added to the fundamental rights and obligations to be shared by all citizens alike irrespective of any distinction of Race or Religion . . .. any further mention of minority rights is on the principle not only unnecessary but self-contradictory. Because it again introduces a consciousness of majority and minority on Communal basis. But as practical politics requires it and as the Hindu Sanghatanists want to relieve our non-Hindu countrymen of even a ghost of suspicion, we are prepared to emphasise that the legitimate rights of minorities with regard to their Religion, Culture, and Language will be expressly guaranteed: on one condition only that the equal rights of the majority also must not in any case be encroached upon or abrogated. Every minority may have separate schools to train up their children in their own tongue, their own religious or cultural institutions and can receive Government help also for these,—but always in proportion to the taxes they pay into the common exchequer. The same principle must of course hold good in case of the majority too.\n\n\\&gt;Over and above this, in case the constitution is not based on joint electorates and on the unalloyed National principle of one man one vote, but is based on the communal basis then those minorities who wish to have separate electorate or reserve seats will be allowed to have them,—but always in proportion to their population and provided that it does not deprive the majority also of an equal right in proportion of its population too\n\n**He concludes his view on position on Non hindus :**\n\n\\&gt;The Moslem minority in India will have the right to be treated as equal citizens, enjoying equal protection and civic rights in proportion to their population. The Hindu majority will not encroach on the legitimate rights of any non-Hindu minority. But in no case can the Hindu majority resign its right which as a majority it is entitled to exercise under any democratic and legitimate constitution. The Moslem minority in particular has not obliged the Hindus by remaining in minority and therefore, they must remain satisfied with the status they occupy and with the legitimate share of civic and political rights that is their proportionate due. It would be simply preposterous t endow the Moslem minority with the right of exercising a practical veto on the legitimate rights and privileges of the majority and call it a " Swarajya ". The Hindus do not want a change of masters, are not going to struggle and fight and die only to replace an Edward by an Aurangazeb simply because the latter happens to be born within Indian borders, but they want henceforth to be masters themselves in their own house, in their own Land. "\n\n**Now, I\'ll put forwad the demand of the Muslim league, which Savarkar was opposed to:**\n\n\\&gt;The Muslims at the Round Table Conference claimed : —\n\n(1) \xa0\xa0 (1 ) \xa0\xa0 That their representatives in all the Provincial as well as in the Central Legislatures should be elected by separate electorates ;\n\n(2) \xa0\xa0 (2 ) \xa0\xa0 That they should be allowed to retain the weightage in representation given to Muslim minorities in those Provinces in which they were a minority in the population, and that in addition, they should be given in those Provinces where they were a majority such as the Punjab, Sind, North-West Frontier Province and Bengal, a guaranteed statutory majority of seats.\n\nBasically the thing was that muslims demanded that where they were in minority, they would have separate electorate and where they were in majority, they wanted guaranteed majority seats, WHEREAS, hindus demanded a joint electorate.\n\nNow, the muslim\'s demands were all agreed upon, which was wrong because muslim minority had a say in their province(separate electorate), but the same rule was forced upon provinces where hindus were in minority but they actually demanded a joint electorate,\n\nHowever, not ONE word from the author on the absurdity of the demand, rather he goes on to bash the award saying its all bad and what not.\n\nFurther,\n\n**This is his take on Savarkar\'s and Hindu maha sabha\'s opinion on the partition issue**\n\n\\&gt;Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist that there are two nations in India—one the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar on the other hand insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus ; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation. In the struggle for political power between the two nations the rule of the game, which Mr. Savarkar prescribes, is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims. \xa0 such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population. Thus by confiscating its weightages, Mr. Savarkar would even strip the Muslim nation of all the political privileges it has secured so far.\n\nHe also says:\n\n\\&gt;Mr. Savarkar will not allow the Muslim nation to be co-equal in authority with the Hindu nation. He wants the Hindu nation to be the dominant nation and the Muslim nation to be the servient nation. Why Mr. Savarkar, after sowing this seed of enmity between the Hindu nation and the Muslim nation should want that they should live under one constitution and occupy one country, is difficult to explain.\n\nI DONT UNDERSTAND THIS!\n\nIt just all sounds like he is trying to justify it anyhow, also, if i\'m not wrong this book was published after the muslim resolution.\n\nAnyone who has read this book, if they can please clarify this, also I\'m sorry, if i came here without reading the entire book, but I couldnt help myself and had to ask.\n\nSorry for the long post'<br />Author: 'eternalrocket'  id: 'hdxwa5'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdxwa5/question_for_the_people_who_have_read_the_book/</li>

The tragedy of it is that the Tibetans put faith in us; they chose to be guided by us; and we have been unable to get them out of the meshes of Chinese diplomacy or Chinese malevolence. We have done everything we could to assuage Chinese feelings, to allay its apprehensions and to defend its legitimate claims in our discussions and correspondence with America and Britain and in the UN. Inspite of this, China is not convinced about our disinterestedness. It continues to regard us with suspicion and the whole psychology is one, at least outwardly, of skepticism perhaps mixed with a little hostility. I doubt if we can go any further than we have done already to convince China of our good intentions, friendliness and goodwill." \n\n"Their last telegram to us is an act of gross discourtesy not only in the summary way it disposes of our protest against the entry of Chinese forces into Tibet but also in the wild insinuation that our attitude is determined by foreign influences. It looks as though it is not a friend speaking in that language but a potential enemy. The undefined state of the frontier and the existence on our side of a population with its affinities to the Tibetans or Chinese have all the elements of the potential trouble."\n\n"Recent and bitter history also tells us that Communism is no shield against imperialism and that the communists are as good or as bad imperialists as any other. While our western and north-western threat to security is still as prominent as before, a new threat has developed from the north and north-east. Thus, for the first time, after centuries, India\'s defence has to concentrate itself on two fronts simultaneously. Our defence measures have so far been based on the calculations of superiority over Pakistan. In our calculations we shall now have to reckon with...a communist China which has definite ambitions and aims and which does not, in any way, seem friendly disposed towards us."\n\nSource: https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1063553715917983744'<br />Author: 'GanguTeli'  id: 'hdupbh'<br />Score:48<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdupbh/sardar_patel_on_china_one_month_before_his_death/</li>

What examples are given in the verse to explain the same ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Answer 1 :** "We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. "\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"We should always consider the position of the īśvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one cannot imitate the īśvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord Śiva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord Śiva who want to indulge in smoking gāñjā (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Śiva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His rāsa-līlā, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many "incarnations" of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lcellt0dh651.jpg?width=570&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b64a3020f5360e3d500aa73888f1b652ea0facd\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : Why the Lord descends to earth ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Answer 2 :** "Varṇa-saṅkara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord Kṛṣṇa descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1uqv9x2dh651.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d004b3bf635b97c9644e3748111c8405cb0bf800\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.24, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Because China knows that without internal distractions it is India that is even a bigger threat to its ambitions than the US which is a declining power.\n\nInstead of playing into Chinese hands India needs to follow its own strategic path and plan to liberate Pakistan occupied Kashmir as soon as possible.\n\nThat is the best way to hurt China and completely destroy its BRI project, effectively neutralizing Chinas rise after American de-coupling. This way India can emerge as an independent third pole of power, balancing both America and China while getting benefits from both.\n\nAfter India controls the most important junction of China’s new silk route it can dictate terms to China and force it to settle all disputed borders in exchange for continued access to these trade routes.\n\nThis well also completely starve Pakistan of its one ally at the world stage and jump start independence movements in other parts of the country. \n\nWhat’s say, is that a good idea?'<br />Author: 'Grand-Routine'  id: 'hdtohi'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdtohi/cmv_china_is_a_distraction_indias_main_focus/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'My views on Left Vs. Right'<br />Body: 'For more than a year, I have been hearing and learning about the synthetic divide of left or right with accordance to Indian political climate. Many people claim that there is no such divide or there is no left wing and right wing narrative and etc. Some say left exist as anti-dharmic or right exist as hindutva. This definition might be partially right or wrong depending on where you stand on the line of political spectrum. Some people have went overboard to define things just to suit their own liking. If you have been in this environment for too long you might have also came across that, \'Indian Right wing is different than American Right wing\' but this only statement contradicts that is there even an opposing wing of people that want to be labeled as Right Winger. If there is an Indian RW how is it different from any other RW. So Im making this post to present my view point that yes India has a RW and LW.\n\nJust like every coin has opposing sides, political leanings are also opposing in their nature or substance which is formed gradually. First I start with defining what does the leftists wants because they have a well defined objective on which each and every leftist agree upon. Leftists draw their inspiration and ideology from foreign sources which were never born in India neither have they visited nor they experienced Indian way of life, this is clear. Second, leftists are anti-majority by their nature, they will oppose each and every person that stands in majority ( Hindus). Third point is the ideas of Marxism and Communism. Both these ideas work towards dissolving existing power structure or hierarchy through destruction in society claiming to make everybody equal. They are also against capitalism (power/money based monopoly). \n\nI have told you what are their ideas let me tell you who are the people that make up the Left wing. LW consists of Marxists, Communist, Socialist, Liberals and minority ( Muslims). Leftists dont have any real support as they have been kicked out from every where and only resides in power in few places like Cuba and China after the collapse of Soviet Union. So they form weird nexuses with other people in that region in order to come to power. This exploitation leads to minority appeasement. Eg Blacks in America, Refugees in Germany, Christians in Africa. Similarity between this joint venture are as follows. A communist in Czechoslovakia thinks same as a congressi in Lutyens\' Delhi. A pork eating, wine drinking Jinahh thinks same as an ISIS leader fighting for Islam. They both are fighting to keep their book relevant even in the present scenario.\n\nNow coming to India, my take on the discourse of Indian Right Wing is, yes it exist but unfortunately it is not defined by BJP or RSS. The BJP has a soft Hindu element which it show off but it is majorly driven by the same Nehruvian socialist model. Real RSS followed the Hindutva ideology but due to the strong opposition they also faced defeat and now propagate a watered down version of Hindutva. So now many people will say if BJP and RSS does not represent RW then who represents it, if some people are Indian RW\'er then who do they follow or draw their ideas from. Or if BJP and RSS are not RW then why does the media bash them for being RW.\n\nIndian politics is confusing because the opposition has long ago already decided their enemy but the people on the other side of the spectrum that want to defend their side just recently began to propagate this idea of Right Wing. So yes there exists a RW in India but right now it is in nascent stage. Indian RW has failed to define a proper coherent ideological construct in the field of thought and politics. As of now it is being defined as orthodoxy which can also be seen as chaotic. For RWers to dominate the space-- ultra orthodox Hindus like Bhajrang Daal need to understand that times have changed and they are still living in past, their moto in driven by hate for other community rather than facts and logic. The Hindutva debate is a 19th century debate; modern India requires intellectual youth to come forward who can update existing definitions and status quo. If BJP, RSS, Bhajrang Daal or Gouraksha Daal is not the RW then who is RW or is it the uncle on youtube who tells everyone to become "Intellectual Shatria" is he RW.\n\nRight now Indian RW has become an apologist, negationist and reactionary in the political ecosystem trying to negate cow lynchings, becoming apologists towards caste system and reactionary towards the other community. All these things really hurt the cause and nation and let the other side win brownie points despite the shear small size of left in any discourse. These things are turning Hinduism into an Abhramic faith where moderates keep apologizing (taqqiya) and the extremists (ISIS) go on a massive spree for ethnic cleansing. This is the thing to keep in mind. \n\nIndian Right-Wing needs to set its own narrative that is modern, inclusive, assertive, derives values from the Dharma and is nationalistic to its core. In present scenario it has been a tussle between the post-modernists and traditionalists even through out social media. The post-modernists see no value in ancient India and the traditionalist-orthodox dont consider the credibility of western construct and outright reject it. The people in RW narrative must bridge this gap to find a sweet spot between religion and some what modernism maybe until a systematic emancipation is done we aint forming any credible pushback.  \n\nI want to conclude this by saying, if leftists are reading Marx you read Kautilya. If they are reading about Mao you read about Savarkar. If they are propagating ideas of Stalin you propagate ideas of Sri Aurobindo. If they are contributing to TheWire you contribute to OpIndia. If they are reading Romilla Thappar you go read RC Majumdar. If they are lobbying for Dhruv Rathee you lobby for Upword. At the end you do not have to become the person you seek to destroy. Becoming the xerox copy of Abhramic religion or marxist is not in my list of Right Wing agenda and neither should it be on the list of any Hindu/Indian. We should only support people if it furthers our cause. Some true right wingers in India that I have come across which understands every aspect of Indic Revolution are J Sai Deepak, Abhinav Prakash, Makarand Paranjape, Vivek Agnihotri, Abhijit Iyer Mitra, Ashish Dhar and JD Bakshi. \n\nThank you for reading till the end'<br />Author: 'noodledanger1'  id: 'hdrx65'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdrx65/my_views_on_left_vs_right/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Got banned from R/Sino for dropping some major truth bombs against their pro-sinic and anti-India propaganda.'<br />Body: '&gt;China\'s economy is 5 times larger than India\'s, and China\'s defence spending is at least 3 times larger. Despite this, India somehow now sees itself as a \'peer competitor\' to China. It, along with the western media are now starting to refer to India as a \'Superpower\'.\n\nIn PPP terms Chinese economy is only 2.5 times than that of India. And the comparison of economy is slightly meaningless given Chinese army has the reputation of losing war with much smaller Vietnam and much "weaker" India in 67. Chinese defense spending is higher because it is a belligerent country having active disputes with all ASEAN-PACIFIC country. In contrast, Indian army at any given point of time has to fight with only two countries: China and Pakistan. China will have to fight a major war to acquire South China Sea, India already has Indian ocean. From Andaman islands Indian navy can any time block Chinese supply routes through Malaccan straits. Considering India is the third largest economy in the world in PPP terms, it is understandable that India will be considered a super power by some people after all super power doesn\'t mean supreme power. Chinese jealousy on India being accorded any sort of respectability is also understandable and hypocritical.\n\n&gt;The west is now actively encouraging this Indian delusion of grandeur to coax India into hostilities with China, another useful tool at China containment with Indian nationalists happily playing along, too naïve to understand they are being used as western lap dogs.\n\nChinese communists has deluded themselves into thinking that they are already sitting on the apex of world order when in reality they are far from it. Part of the reason for their delusion is that they have been listening too much to western analysts and intelligentsia who needed to construct a new adversary after soviet union fell to keep themselves relevant. And what do Chinese do with this new found delusions of being the numero uno? In the very first day as "number one power" they spread wuhan virus to the world and right when people are defending themselves against what is most likely a bio-weapon, they choose to create security+economic problems in the wider neighborhood. I am no expert of any sort but even United States took more days to create such irreversible damage. Understandably China doesn\'t have a single friend in world. Even people from vassal states like Pakistan are abusing Chinese communists for deliberately spreading the virus.\n\n&gt;My message to Indian nationalists who are loving this new found love fest from the west and the portrayal of India being a \'new superpower\' ready to take on China, be careful what you wish for.\n\nHere is my message to Chinese communists should they choose to listen to it: You are not the top dog of the world. You are not the top of Asia. You are not the top dog of South Asia or East Asia. End all your delusions. A large section of humanity that so far had not even heard the name of your country, today knows you for only one reason - You are the source of coronavirus, Your government hid it and You are the ones who made their life miserable - and they will remember it for their entire life. This is considered as your biggest contribution to the world. If you think India being portrayed as a benign rising power is bad for India then think how much worse it is for China to be portrayed as mischievous corona creator. The contrast couldn\'t have been more starker. Think about it.\n\n&gt;All the shocking and embarrassing skeletons in India\'s closet the west are conveniently ignoring now (human rights abuses in Kashmir, high rates of violent/chauvinistic attacks against women, Medieval Caste system, religious conflict, bizarre cultural practices such as drinking cow urine to cure corona virus, child exploitation in slums, etc) will come pouring out like a fountain, and they themselves can experience the same good ol\' western xenophobia and racism China is experiencing now.\n\nIndia is an open society. India\'s so called embarrassments are out there in open for people to poke, prod, comment and criticize. This is indeed very hard for Chinese communists to wrap their head around because nothing in the world could be more opposed to their way of life than this one - they would rather hide the news of their fallen soldiers than grant them a respectable martyrdom or Chinese vassals like North Korea who would rather starve their people than request the world for food aid. Chinese communists would rather starve themselves to death in millions when their power hungry leaders like Mao make duplicitous calls for cultural revolution and great leap. You know how Indian people would react if Indian leaders make such call: Fuck government. And, this is not seen as sign of weakness or indiscipline rather of strength: strength of that contract which powers the government and all higher forms of authority.'<br />Author: 'yonhi'  id: 'hdpkn5'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdpkn5/got_banned_from_rsino_for_dropping_some_major/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Unpopular opinion] Religious superstition does not necessarily mean wrong or foolish - it just means we are just ignorant of the reason behind a ritual.'<br />Body: 'Ancient Rishis prescribe certain DOs and DONTs based on their tapasya. They mention the reason to their shishyas.  \nOver time, the reason gets forgotten, but the DOs &amp; DONTs remain.\n\nIt\'s possible that the circumstances in which those rules were made are not applicable now, hence following those rules has no benefit.\n\nIt\'s also possible they are applicable throughout eternity of samsara. I believe this. You may not. That\'s OK.\n\nIf you want to keep a scientific open-mind, then we go back to **unfalsifiability** argument . The flying-teapot argument that skeptics usually put forth - There is no proof that a flying-teapot or a flying-spaghetti monster does not orbit the earth, so why don\'t you bhakts believe that too.\n\n1. Our elders, acharyas and gurus, whom we trust, did not advise us to believe them.\n\n2. The rishis who gave us scriptures did not claim they were fictional imaginative works, but scientists who put forth teapot-monster ideas claimed they are fiction.\n\n3. There are infinite things that can be claimed, and we don\'t want to waste time investigating everything. What we believe in, must offer some benefit. We believe that rishis, gurus, acharyas, parents only have our benefit in their mind.\n\n4. Our grandparents/parents generation was poor and focused on getting basic livelihood going after a millenium of foreigner looting. They did not have the time nor interest to learn the reason behind rituals, so they simply followed.\n\n5. Most common folks today, even those who claim \'critical-thinking\' skills, don\'t read the medical research papers behind pharmaceutical double-blind studies, but simply trust the doctors (and advertisers) and eat medicines. And it works, whether they believe in the medicine or not. Same thing with religious \'medicines\'. They will work whether you believe it or not.\n\n6. But there is a small difference in \'faith\'. If you are late to the office, saying "I\'m sorry", avoids getting cited by Boss. But if you are arrogant, you will be treated fair-and-square in the next performance review. Similarly, if you are humble and have faith when doing rituals, your transgressions (e.g. you must not eat before bathing in morning, you must wash your hands &amp; feet after nature call) might be looked over. But if you are arrogant, then don\'t complain when you don\'t get results of rituals.\n\n7. People claim that falsifiability is the bedrock of science, whereas religious claims are unfalsifiable. This is not true. Science, for instance, cannot prove subjective truths (I felt happy, Sugar tasted sweet etc.), because it is dependent upon the 5-senses to \'prove\' something to others (objective truths). Religion is mainly about the atma, karma, bhagavan - all of which are intensely subjective (and true). But it falls outside the domain of expertise of scientists. So they label it \'superstition\'.\n\nThat\'s OK. Let people be skeptical. Most of them are not purposely adamant or stupid. Nobody should trust a modern-baba, nor a snake-oil scientist. Until they verify the benefits (if any) for themselves, they can and should be skeptical.  \nBut, **they must take some effort to verify**, if interested. Until then they can neither praise nor blame the other party.\n\nThis applies equally to religion and science.'<br />Author: 'waeva2'  id: 'hdm8da'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdm8da/unpopular_opinion_religious_superstition_does_not/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bravery of Indian soldiers should not mask incompetent military (army) leadership at the top level.'<br />Body: "India is [second most patriotic country](https://www.businessinsider.com/yougov-19-most-patriotic-countries-in-the-world-2016-11#2-india-18) in the world. India is a country where average citizen passionately contribute to Country's self respect in anyway they can, for example Boycott China movement which is prevalent among Indians is usually not seen in any country where China is against. \n\nI don't have to talk about average Indian Soldier's commitment towards India irrespective of life threats. Many soldiers voluntarily signed up for a duty fully aware where they can lose their in line of action.\n\nThe bravery of Indian soldiers who went berserek on Chinese army without arms, once they learned about their beloved colonel's fate in the hands of betraying Chinese army and diplomats. Contributing to 20 Indian soldiers losing their lives for the country. \n\nWhile these veerjawaans remain forever in our memories, it's important to not let on the ground soldier's bravery mask absolute incompetence of military leadership especially CDS Bipin Rawat and Army Chief Narawane.\n\nBack in May 2020, when initial reports surfaced regarding Chinese aggression along LAC. This is what Army Chief Narawane has to say.\n\nSource: [https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/words-matter-so-speak-carefully-66170/](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/words-matter-so-speak-carefully-66170/)\n\n&gt;**In his statement, Army Chief General M M Naravane, has made two rather curious points. One pertained to the causes of the clashes which he attributed to “aggressive behaviour by both sides” leading to troop injuries. And the other was his assessment that the scuffles between Indian and Chinese soldiers are “neither co-related nor do they have any connection with other global or local activities.”**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**These are extraordinary submissions by an Indian army chief at a number of levels. First, they seem to give an impression that we are keen to absolve China of its aggressive policy along the LAC. By underling aggressive behaviour by both sides, the Army chief seems to be blaming his own soldiers for these tensions. Even if this is accurate, was this needed to be part of a public statement by the head of the Indian Army?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Second, why are we so keen to speak on behalf of the Chinese? When the Army chief suggests that these scuffles have nothing to do with other global activities, the question arises how would an Indian Army Chief purport to know the Chinese game plan? There is a global concern about aggressive military moves China has made in the last two months from the South China Sea to Taiwan and Japan. And Indian Army Chief seems to know with certain degree of conviction that India-China border tussle has nothing to do with this larger military posturing by the Chinese. Again, it may very well be the case that India-China border tussle has logic of its own, but an Indian Army Chief’s job is not to explain Chinese actions to Indian public.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**China’s response to the scuffle has, of course, been that India should “refrain from making any complicating move.” A simple statement that delivers the message to everyone while we in India do our bit to defend Chinese actions.**\n\nEveryone is now aware what happened on June 15, how complicated the issue has become.\n\nCDS Bipin Rawat, who is missing in action for past few months, is the champion of making Army into glorified police in J&amp;K with counter ops instead of developing military capability. Both Bipin and Narawane come from the same establishment where the belief is that Indian AirForce and Navy role is only to support Army and ground troops. Within the same framework, Indian army war waging  capabilities  are neglected in favor of counter Insurgency ops in Kashmir. \n\nWhen it was announced that Bipin Rawat would serve as first CDS, Narawane was brought into picture as Vice Chief of army in Sept 2019 and becoming Army Chief replacing Bipin within three months. The only qualification that Narawane brings to the table is supposed successful counter insurgency Ops in kashmir that's been going on for past 2 decades. Bipin Rawat already successfully made sure, Airforce and Navy takes backseat with limited role, forgetting the fact how Air Force saved Indian wars multiple times throughout history including 1971. It's important to note that 1971 war started only after Pakistan bombed Indian airfields because Indian airforce was the area where Pakistan was afraid of. \n\nIt's pretty evident from Narawane statements along with Bipin Rawat's disappearance, we can understand why february's  Intelligence report regarding massive PLA movement in Tibet was ignored.\n\nThankfully it was Air Chief Marshal **Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria,** who finally gave a much needed assurance regarding India's military commitment.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drYjRqaDLMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drYjRqaDLMM)\n\nOnce the settles down, it is important to reform India's military leadership, bureaucracy and diplomats.

      <li>Title::: 'Jhoomri tilaiya proves that one man can make a big change happen'<br />Body: 'Apparently there was one guy in Jhoomri tilaiya who kept requesting for 20-25 songs daily on vividh bharti. Looking at him, two of his neighbors began doing the same thing. Because of these three, it became a fad in that small town to request for songs on the radio. There were so many requests that the presenters and listeners began wondering if it\'s a fake town. And the town\'s name became a phenomenon. \n\nAnd it all started with the one guy. \n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nOriginally a little-known town, Jhumri Telaiya became famous in India in the 1950s owing to its connection with the radio channels\xa0Radio Ceylon\xa0and\xa0Vividh Bharati\xa0(a nationally broadcast radio service of the\xa0All India Radio). At a time when numerous television channels and FM radio stations were yet to come to India, the radio shows were a national phenomenon. The largest number of requests for film songs addressed to the channel came from Jhumri Telaiya.\n\nThe trend started in the early 1950s, when a mica businessman named Rameshwar Prasad Barnwal started mailing 20-25 song requests (farmaish) to Radio Ceylon daily. Regularly hearing Barnwal\'s name on the radio inspired the\xa0paan-shop owner Ganga Prasad Magadhiya and Electronics Shop Owner of Nandlal Sinha to similarly mail a large number of song requests. The growing fame of these three Jhumri Telaiya residents led to the emergence of a song-request fad among the people of the town. Young listeners from the town would compete among themselves to send out the most song requests in a day or month. The radio listeners thus became familiar with the town of Jhumri Telaiya. In the 1980s, a radio listeners\' club was formed in the town. Subsequently, other towns also started competing with Jhumari Telaiya by sending out a large number of song requests. The fad declined as\xa0television\xa0gained popularity, and postal costs increased.\n\nBecause of a large number of song requests and the town\'s unusual name, many listeners of Vividh Bharti used to doubt its existence.Thus the "Jhumri Talaiya" came to be associated with any less-known or insignificant place. This reference is found in several Hindi movies and songs. For example, the movie\xa0Mounto\xa0(1975) features a song titled\xa0Mein Toh Jhumri Taliyah Seh Aeyehi Hun\xa0("I\'ve come from Jhumri Talaiya").'<br />Author: 'sensitiveinfomax'  id: 'hdgt6s'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hdgt6s/jhoomri_tilaiya_proves_that_one_man_can_make_a/</li>

He tells about everyone, Sugreeva, Mainda, Dvivida, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Ram and Lakshmana. \n\nAt some point, he starts enumerating the total number of Sainiks. \n\nThis, for me, is one of the most clear evidences of the quintessential Indian - Mathematical love for extremely large numbers. \n\nशतम् शतसहस्राणाम् कोटिमाहुर्मनीषिणः || ६-२८-३३\n\nशतम् कोटिसहस्राणाम् शङ्कुरित्यभिधीयते |\n\n100 , 100-1000's is a crore say manishis.\n\n100 , Crore 1000's is considered a Shanku. \n\nThese are definitions of Koti (crore) and Shanku (Shankh) in terms of Shata(100), and Sahasra (1000). \n\nUsing these definitions, the Ram Sena numbers take-off vertically like a Sukhoi-30. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nशतम् शङ्कुसहस्राणाम् महाशङ्कुरिति स्मृतः || ६-२८-३४\n\n100 Shanku 1000s is recalled as MahaShanku \n\nमहाशङ्क्य्सहस्राणाम् शतम् वृन्दमिहोच्यते |\n\n1000 Mahashanku 100 times is called Vrinda.\n\nशतम् नृन्दसहस्राणाम् महावृन्दमिति स्मृतम् || ६-२८-३५\n\n100 Vrinda 1000s is recalled as Mahavrinda\n\nमहावृन्दसहस्राणाम् शतम् पद्ममिहोच्यते |\n\n1000 Mahavrinda 100 times is called Padma\n\nशतम् पद्मसहस्राणाम् महापद्ममिति स्मृतम् || ६-२८-३६\n\n100 Padma 1000s is recalled as MahaPadma\n\nमहापद्मसहस्राणाम् शतम् खर्वमिहोच्यते |\n\n1000 MahaPadma 100 times is called Kharva\n\nशतम् खर्वसहस्राणाम् महाखर्वमिति स्मृतम् || ६-२८-३७\n\n100 Kharva 1000s is recalled as MahaKharva\n\nमहाखर्वसहस्राणाम् समुद्रमभिधीयते |\n\n1000 MahaKharva 100 times is called Samudra\n\nशतम् समुद्रसाहस्रमोघ इत्यभिधीयते || ६-२८-३८\n\n100 Samudra 1000s is recalled as Ogha\n\nशतमोघसहस्राणाम् महौघ इति विश्रुतः |\n\n100 Ogha 1000s is known as Maha-Ogha. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne realizes that the nouns starts with Koti and end with Maha-Ogha.

      <li>Title::: 'Chynese World View'<br />Body: 'Source BRF\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How China sees itself**  \n\n\n* China is **not** a Communist country: It is a country ruled by a communist party, that\'s the extent of its communism. In some ways it is like Post-Soviet republics of the USSR with a hyper-capitalist, robber baron, crony capitalist oligarchy.   \n\n* It is a **Han** nation. All other minorities get to wear regional costumes like dressed up monkeys when the attend a few congresses in Beijing, but they are second class. This is seen in their repression of Tibetans and Uyghurs. Partly, they want to cilvilise (or make Han) these barbarians practicing strange religions, and stuck in the past.  \n\n* China is a **modern** civilised country (almost western). Think Meiji restoration Japan, think Singapore. See the CCP functionaries wearing western suits, with CCP badges.   \n\n* China is on its way to restoring its place as the **centre of the world**. The USA is an obstacle it will need to overcome for this.  \n\n* The **CCP has the mandate of heaven**. All Chinese **emperors** needed to have this, otherwise someone with the mandate would usurp their place. CCP is the current dynasty and Xi is the current emperor (for life). Everything becomes a lot clearer when China is seen in its imperial tradition.  \n\n* China is **orderly and stable**. At the moment. The typical condition of China over the past 200 years has been of disorder. The Taiping rebellion, civil war, cultural revolution, etc. So finally the CCP has brought order. Order is way more important than "freedom". Freedom is something they know from Hollywood, not really for China but maybe its worth visiting Disneyworld to see what it\'s like.  \n\n* China is **corrupt to the core** and the CCP is the heart of this corruption. This is something most people find terrible and all the protests and opposition are inevitably protests against corrupt petty functionaries. But to get rid of corruption, you have to get rid of the CCP and if you get rid of the CCP, China wouldn\'t function. At the moment corruption is not as ostentatious as before. People are keeping their heads down because Xi was collecting heads to stabilise his rule. Since everyone is corrupt, everyone was afraid of his anti-corruption drive.   \n\n* China is a **merchant empire**. The CCP to sustain its corruption needs heavy trade. If the size of the pie shrinks, there will be infighting. Which will weaken its hold.  \n\n* **CCP has two enemies** The Chinese People and the USA. The fall of the USSR has been the biggest nightmare of the CCP, and both these factors are thought to have played a role. The CCP spends a very substantial amount on internal security, according to some accounts as much as on external security.  \n\n* China has 3 classes: **Peasants** (the majority, who nowadays are usually migrant workers); the **nouveau riche** and the **rulers CCP**. All three are afraid of each other. The newly rich are happy, obedient and scared to lose what they have, send their children to study abroad and hope to migrate to USA; the worker/peasants are the ones who cause disturbances and are in terrible shape. The rulers are insanely rich, insanely corrupt and insanely paranoid, everyone has at least 2 different passports for their children, apart from the chinese one.\n\n**What is China doing in Ladakh?**  \n\n\nBased on what I have written so far I think this is a **mission to subdue the periphery**. The army is on an expedition to pacify the frontier and punish the uppity kingdom on the periphery, India. Show them who\'s the boss and then return to the heartland.   \n\n\nThis is also about warning India not to join an alliance with the USA. For us, this might sound ridiculous but when you read how the Chinese see us, it makes perfect sense that we will **not** ally ourselves with the USA after receiving this warning. Ideas like humiliation being bad for relations are alien to them (humility is a virtue, they are simply showing India its place). That we might have self-respect or might actually care about strategic autonomy or be protecting our own interests are simply incomprehensible and completely out of sync with how they see us.  \n\n\nSeveral people have tried to think of the current situation in terms of military strategy. That makes absolutely no sense. It is almost certainly **not** about protecting the Aksai Chin highway. Firstly the PLA is not too bright in terms of military tactics, for example having 200 trucks inside a gorge seems foolish even to a civilian like me. Secondly, the empire never expects trouble or attack inside its borders. I think maybe one or two junior officers in the PLA might entertain the thought of an Indian armored attack and prepare a report on that but I think that\'s inconceivable for the majority. Also practically, China has enough heavy lift capability and construction skills to have a replacement highway running very quickly.   \n\n\nFor those suggesting more fantastic ideas like a **shortcut to PoK** over the Karakoram pass. The Karakoram Pass is the one point on the boundary that there is no conflict about. Secondly, the Karakoram Highway has nothing to do with the Karakoram Pass. The geography of the area makes it impossible to build a road. Thirdly even the KKH is more or less a gesture for Pakistan, nothing seriously economic about it. it is far away from the economic and population heartland of China. Pakistan is a model tributary state, so it is rewarded with favors like the CPEC. From at least 2013, I have been telling anyone who would listen that it\'s a big joke. Some Chinese companies will get to build stuff and make a lot of money, which will be shared through the hierarchy but trade with Pakistan over the KKH **makes utterly, absolutely no sense**.  \n\n\nThe current conflict is for the average Chinese, out there in Timbuktu. Tibet is already like Antarctica inhabited by the savages for the majority of them. And then there is some fight with India, a country they have heard of. It\'s quite an exotic place, people dance all the time, they\'ve seen Bollywood movies. That\'s why I think **the idea of domestic messaging doesn\'t quite fly**. Hong Kong is easy to crush, also sends out a message about the supremacy of the CCP and the futility of democracy protests, but Tibet, as far away as it can get? With a third rate country like India? They have a vague idea that it\'s full of poor people who dance but is there really glory in defeating their army? That\'s only to be expected surely. This has also created a headache for the CCP, did high-tech Han warriors actually get slaughtered by dirty Red Turbans? \\[This is currently a very popular question on Chinese social media, which is being asked indirectly in many different ways\\].   \n\n\n**Lessons for India**  \n\n\n* **Conflict with China is inevitable**. So we must make sure we find the right time and place for it. It will not be a total war. Total war is too unpredictable and might cut into the CCPs earnings.   \n\n* **Localised conflict is feasible and manageable** Tibet is not worth much to the CCP. Of course a dynasty never allows its size to be reduced, but if Lhasa or Amdo or any city in Tibet or Xinjiang were destroyed, the CCP wouldn\'t even blink. But the CCP will at no costs see even the smallest threat to the heartland (south-west China). So escalation won\'t proceed beyond a certain step on the ladder  \n\n* Any war will be about **temporary deterrence and not permanent victory**. When we give them a bloody nose, they\'ll leave us alone for 30 years. But then we\'ll have to fight them again  \n\n* **Diplomacy is about delay and obfuscation, not resolution**. Talking helps pass the time until its time for military conflict. Any promises aren\'t worth the toilet paper they are written on. A loophole will be found as and when necessary.  \n\n* It\'s not Sun Tzu (Sun Zi) who\'s relevant to Chinese military strategy but Weiqi. I find it a bit ridiculous because The Art of War is quite elliptical and can be interpreted as one wishes. I haven\'t read it myself and I\'m convinced most people who quote it haven\'t either. What Chinese Generals were also mesmerised by was the Gulf War 1. That and RMA have very much shaped their understanding of how the next war (with USA) will be fought.   \n\n* **They will be hopeless at mountain warfare** From everything I read, their strategy seems to be one of overwhelming the enemy. Send 2000 soldiers, 200 tanks, 500 trucks and 20 bulldozers to scare 200 enemy soldiers. This strategy might work on Tiananmen Square (as it indeed did) but not in the mountains. I don\'t know anything about weapons systems but I have a suspicion networked warfare is not really the best way to fight in the mountains. Massed forces are also probably not the best idea in Ladakh (perhaps with the exception of Depsang)  \n\n* This might make me sound like a Pakistani, but the Chinese have nothing to even remotely match the **Indian soldier\'s spirit**. I just tried to think of how many of my Chinese acquaintances might be willing to die for their country and I honestly can\'t think of a single one. In case of India obviously I have family, friends, neighbors, one doesn\'t need more than 5 seconds to think of 10 people. The Chinese spirit comes from Han superiority and fear of their officers, especially the political officers. This means they are ripe for desertion, and if there are non-Han soldiers they can probably be used to create disorder within their armies. The han superiority also makes them afraid of barbarians. They are always scared by people with heavy beards and scary mustaches.   \n\n* their lack of democracy means they are **very brittle against information warfare**. I had posted earlier how Chinese social media was relying on the messaging of the new Baba Banaras twitter account. All their news came from Indian media. If we can spread some fake videos or pics of mutilated Chinese soldiers, that will *not enrage but scare them*. It will perfectly fit their image of savage barbarians and the modern Chinese population is all up for CGI warfare but not to see skulls crushed with rocks.  \n\n* The planning is done by Generals, approved by Beijing, and then flows down to the soldiers. This **system lacks innovation** and probably won\'t be very flexible on the ground. Though it may very well lead to brilliant strategy in the case of experienced generals, the tactics will probably be shoddy and predictable.  \n\n* We should try to **understand them** and how they see us and take advantage of it. We must also be willing to adapt to their working style, which might mean giving up on values like honour and truth. We always feel betrayed by them because they act differently to our expectations. When we understand their worldview, we will be the ones taking advantage of them.  \n\n* **What CCP does not want is a widespread front and protracted warfare**. Traditionally such pacification exercises (Ladakh, but also Xinjiang and Tibet) were conducted in order to free the empire for more important work (like confronting the USA). We will know we have won this round when General Zhao is recalled to Beijing.'<br />Author: 'mark_wala_teja'  id: 'hda6bv'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hda6bv/chynese_world_view/</li>

Here's the video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEV4BGJyfW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEV4BGJyfW0)\n\nThe real reason, as per this view is that it's not Ladakh that the China is too excited to gain ground on but its fear that the future of CPEC in particular and its Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI) in general, is at stake since this current Indian Govt is very serious about the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) area. CPEC passes through the GB. This is just a viewpoint/ opinion which maybe right or wrong, only China knows. Please let me know if you too agree with this view or have a different viewpoint.

      <li>Title::: 'How the Chinese see us Indians'<br />Body: 'How the Chinese see us Indians\n\n1. Inferior: There is absolutely no question about this. If anyone talks about how they consider India as the origin of Buddhism, or ancient civilisation, then it\'s garbage. China doesn\'t give a damn about all that. There might be a reluctant admission that India has an ancient history but for them that history ended with the arrival of the British. The cultural revolution also pretty much cut off the contact of China with their own heritage, so they don\'t value culture too highly. Japan makes them insecure, USA makes them very insecure but India is inferior and not really to be taken seriously. Also India is poor and dirty. \n\n2. Arrogant: This is a very bad thing in Chinese eyes. Humility is a virtue, arrogance is a sin. Arrogance for them means that India does not know its place. This started from the time of Nehru who tried to pretend that he was a leader of Asia. All the stuff about the UN seat for China and all that, that was China\'s right, Nehru was doing his duty, that\'s all. That\'s why they like Pakistan. It is servile, flatters the leaders and knows its place. (This is not a new thing, even declassified cables from the 1950s show the Pakistanis were being chamchas and undermining India).\n\n3. Tools of powerful countries The first time the Chinese had contact with Indians in modern times was with Sikh policemen in service of the British. This shapes their perception of Indians till today. I\'ll quote some academic research by Isabella Jackson about this:\n\n[Popular histories] usually include a reference to the slang\nterm by which the Sikhs were known among Chinese, hongtou asan,\nwhich has been translated variously as ‘red-headed monkeys’, ‘red-\nheaded rascals’, or ‘turbaned number threes’. All reflect their status\nin Chinese eyes as the vicious lackeys of their British masters. Hongtou\nis a reference to the red turbans that formed part of the police uniform\nfor the Sikhs, while asan is thought to derive from the Sikhs’ third-\nclass social position in Shanghai, or from a transliteration of either the\nBritish exclamation ‘I say’ or ‘ah, sir’, as Shanghai’s Chinese addressed\nthe Sikhs. Popular racist perceptions of Sikhs [see them as] ‘black devils’ (heigui), the Indian troops of the\nBritish in nineteenth-century China\n\nAll current social media discussion of the India-China conflict uses the term hongtou 紅頭 (red turbans) or asan 阿三 (number threes) or heigui 黑鬼 (black devils) to describe us. Most of their racist caricatures also show the Indian Army as composed of Sikhs. Indians oppressed the Chinese for the British, later they served the interest of the Soviets and now they want to serve the interests of the USA. They thought the entire idea of NAM was a self-serving lie by Nehru to fool Asian countries while serving the interests of white masters. That\'s pretty much what they think of India today. "Strategic autonomy" for them is again a fake front that India puts up (in fear of China) while it secretly serves the interests of the USA against China.\n\n4. Duplicitous They have always thought of Indians in this way, partly self-projection. Partly because they see the adversary in their own image. The idea of honor is completely alien to Chinese thought. Which means all this talk of India about honor or keeping its word must be a lie. Which means they are hiding something else. Sometimes, China is smart enough to see through India (and see whatever they wanted to see). Being honest is not something anyone places too much value on. In China it is every man for himself. They wouldn\'t think twice about cheating anyone and corruption (also within the PLA) is expected and only punished as part of a package deal, if someone also commits another crime like disloyalty to the party.\n\n5. Divided Since we are a democracy, all our internal differences are all out there for the entire world to see. The Chinese differences are not visible, not even to the Chinese themselves. So they can comment about Racism in USA without bothering to give a second thought to their prison camps (which anyway only have the second class Uyghurs). They see India divided between rich and poor, castes and naturally all sorts of political parties. \n\nThese are all the comfortable opinions China holds but there are some things that make them uneasy or slightly challenge their picture of India. The space programme makes them very insecure (not just them actually). The nuclear programme makes them angry, India has no right to do such things. The CCP also fears to some extent that a successful democracy might give the people the wrong ideas. Hong Kong is an ideological threat. Taiwan too, that\'s why they love sharing videos of fist-fights in the Taiwanese Parliament. The Indian IT thing made them uncomfortable earlier but they then decided Indians were good at doing stupid repetitive stuff.\n\nHow the Chinese see their neighbours\nSimply put as vassals. There is a periphery which needs to be periodically pacified. China is the centre of the world, if any of the small countries at its periphery gets uppity then it must periodically be taught a lesson. A peaceful periphery is especially important when the Kingdom is facing challenges. Xinjiang quite literally means "new frontier". Tibet is also part of the same strategy. Having a frontier area outside the main heartland is part of the Chinese tradition (also inner Mongolia, outer Mongolia is another story). These regions usually faced benign neglect and occasional severe repression and they were just kept around as an insulation of the heartland, extracting resources and all was secondary. So we have the heartland, directly ruled barbarians (Tibet, Xinjiang), and tributaries (Laos, Mongolia but also uppity ones like Vietnam) outside that. The tributaries should send gifts to the emperor and recognise his authority and they\'ll be left alone.'<br />Author: 'thesaint2'  id: 'hd5n0r'<br />Score:107<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hd5n0r/how_the_chinese_see_us_indians/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'AN ATHEIST FROM ANDHRA PRADESH :: Azad'<br />Body: 'I was fortunate to be born in a secular country like India. I was born in an economically backward Muslim family in a remote village in Andhra Pradesh in 1947. No one in my family had gone to school. My father was a farmer and I was the only male child who survived, with three sisters, out of eight issues.\nMy school going was an accident; my grandfather had sent me to school as a punishment because I refused to eat nontasty food in the house. After a month of this forcible practice of going to school it became a regular activity for me. My first standard teacher advised my grandfather not to discontinue my schooling, as I was showing much interest in studies. It happened to be a Telugu-language primary school.\n\nBy the time I reached third standard I was top of the class. One fine day the Urdu school administration realized that the standard in Urdu schools was dropping. It was a practice that only Muslim boys came to study in Urdu schools. The Urdu school administration decided that all Muslim children studying in Telugu schools should come back to the Urdu school. The Urdu school did not have a good reputation and none of its students had completed primary education and had gone on to high school. My Telugu schoolteachers advised my parents not to discontinue my Telugu school.\n\nMy father refused to obey the fatwa given by the Urdu school headmaster. The matter was put to the village court. The village head summoned my father and me for a hearing. The village head tried to convince my father that the Urdu school was meant for the Muslim community. My father insisted that I was doing well in the Telugu school and there was no future for Urdu studies. The village head asked me a mathematical question to test my intelligence. The answer from me was instantaneous and it inspired the village head to support my father\'s decision. He gave a ruling that apart from this boy (me) all other Muslim children should go to the Urdu school. He offered to help my father by sending tutors to provide extra coaching for me, but this proved unnecessary.\n\nAfter this incident the whole Muslim community boycotted our family, including our close relatives. My father was rigid in his decision; he did not yield to their pressure and continued my schooling in Telugu, where I was the top in every class till my high school education was completed. After that, knowing my father\'s financial position, I stopped my further studies and I was looking for job opportunities. Even in those days (1964) getting employment without a recommendation was difficult. After the schooling I was told to learn Arabic so that I could read the Koran and pray like other Muslim boys. I was able to read the Koran but without knowing or understanding the contents other than "Allah is the only God, Muhammad is His Prophet." After this I used to go to the mosque every Friday and listen to the imam\'s preaching.\n\nAfter one year of my schooling I got a first call from the district employment exchange to attend an interview for Indian Air Force selection for airmen category. Selection was purely on merit basis; hence, I got through the tests and was selected for technical trades. That was a turning point in my life. I was exposed to the greater world meeting people from different communities and cultures. Initially I was belittled by the Muslim boys, who had come from Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir, as I did not know how to read and write Urdu. Even my Hyderabadi Urdu accent was fun for them. Then I decided that I would have to overcome this inferiority. I started learning Urdu and was eventually able to read the magazines and write to some extent.\n\nA Muslim colleague from Northern India felt that I should know more about Islam, like praying five times and fasting during Ramadan. I followed him in all these activities with utmost dedication. One day I found a flaw in him: he was following a girl to tease her. I knew he was a married man. I questioned him about this improper activity, and he covered it up saying it is permitted according to the holy text provided the girl gives her consent. In Indian terms it is adultery; how could it be permitted in Islam? I could not digest it and I could not argue with him, as he knew more about religion than I.\n\nI used to visit my native place once a year and I got news from my friends about the local Muslim heads\' atrocities against other women, such as the case where a lady teacher from the Urdu school was raped by a Muslim cleric, whom I used to respect a lot for his knowledge of religion. Since the cleric was a close relative of the husband, the rape brought shame on the family, so the lady was forced to commit suicide for having such an affair! I used to also closely watch the activities of Muslim elders, but I had no answer for their evil deeds. They would say one thing in the mosque and do the opposite outside.\n\nI was also astonished to hear about the communal riots in Meerut and Hyderabad. Why were these people fighting in the name of religion, saying that God is one? I used to also read a lot of Telugu literature, where modern Telugu writers expressed their radical views. I started doubting the existence of God. I started reading the Koran in Telugu, in a translation dating from the 1940s. The latest translators were skipping some of the objectionable sentences or giving them polished and softer meanings. To my surprise I found many objectionable and contradictory sentences in that so-called holy book. The only good sentence I found in that holy book was "When you go to some one\'s house knock the door and wait till it is opened." All the preaching in the Koran is against humanity, and there is no word in it like "humanity" or its equivalent. My belief against Islam became stronger. I started using the objectionable sentences of the Koran against those people who questioned my atheism. I have also read the Bible and the Hindu holy books; they are all the same. I understood these books were written by people who did not posses scientific knowledge.\n\nProphet Muhammad\'s preaching clearly indicates that he was selfish and a dictator, who kept his army (followers) intact by giving them booty of cash and women, which they collectively fought for and won. He also lured them by promising a place in heaven after death. Any dissident was mercilessly killed. Islam is not a religion of peace, but terror. For that matter, all religions and castes (in India) have a similar history of hate of others.\n\nBut I did not know what the alternative to religion and God was. As no one had expressed similar views to me, I unwillingly used to go to Idgah (the Muslim holy festivals, literally: place of 7d) twice a year, for lid al fitr\' and \'id al-adha (Baqra lid) (the festival of the breaking of the fast of Ramadan, and the feast of sacrifice, respectively: the two principal Muslim festivals). My parents were also not so religious minded, hence they did not oppose my will.\nIn such circumstances I came across a periodical called the Atheist. I was surprised to learn that people like me existed. I rushed to the Atheist Centre to congratulate them and to know more about atheism. We Become Atheists by the late Mr. Gora\' cleared all my doubts. Then I was about thirty years old. I openly denounced religion and told my Muslim friends I would only come to the mosque if God\'s existence could be proven by science. I was considered the wisest boy in my village, so they could not question my decision about religion. After that I never looked back. I started reading more and more intellectual articles, and listening to the lectures of learned humanists.\n\nA critical situation arose in my life, that is, conducting the marriages of my children. I have one son and one daughter. When I was convinced about my beliefs and explained them to my wife, she, too, was convinced without much effort from me and we brought up our children in a nonreligious, scientific, and humanistic way. I took the opinions of my children as to which way they would like to live. They preferred the way I taught them. Then we (my wife and I) wanted to conduct their marriages in a nonreligious way, irrespective of the other family\'s religion (provided they had similar rationalistic views). There was some resistance from my close relatives who insisted that at least Nikah (the Muslim marriage ceremony) should be conducted. I was able to convince them that it was not necessary. Both my children\'s marriages have now taken place and they are living happily without "mental slavery."\nHence the need of the hour is "universal humanism," which can only be achieved by education for all and by getting rid of superstitions.\n\nNOTE :-\n\n1. Gora (1902-1975) was a well-known Indian atheist and social reformer. He founded the Atheist Centre in Vijayawada, India, in 1947. He was a prolific writer, in English and Telegu, of atheist tracts and books such as An Atheist with Gandhi; Partyless Democracy; We Become Atheists; and Atheism, Questions and Answers.'<br />Author: 'Daddy_Nibba_69'  id: 'hd21h3'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hd21h3/an_atheist_from_andhra_pradesh_azad/</li>

Hindus today are spineless and directionless. I said they will resort to civil war because of their lack of direction. \n\nIt is up to the Hindus and Buddhists of India and Southeast Asia to build more cohesion in the region. The impact of Hindu and Buddhist language and culture is too large to overcome. \n\nIslam is too small to unite the region and so is Marxism. As it stands, Islam has huge problems of political disunity within itself anyway. Marxism has no legitimacy because the only large communist power in the world (China) grew because of Capitalism and access to the American Marketplace. \n\n\nRegarding Indian Muslims and Marxists, You can say what you want but India is a Hindu majority. Nothing you or I say changes the facts of history. It is India’s hindu majority that has defined India for over 2,000 years. Neither Islam nor Communism has ever defined India to the World. Even Muslims in South Asia speak the same language as Hindus, they don’t speak Arabic. There is little cohesion between south Asian Muslims and Arab Muslims in this regard. \n\nEven Chinese historians like Hu Shih have stated that India dominated China for 2,000 years without ever sending a single soldier across her borders.” For 18 of the last 20 centuries, India and China have been the top two economies in the world. \n\nYou can be angry or upset and play victim, but just because someone’s  ancestors decide to become Mohommadean 200 years ago doesn’t change the political identity of a country or its people. Islam has simply not been in South Asia long enough or with enough impact to create a lasting presence - Pakistan is a great example of a failed state that defines itself on Islam but has trouble even existing, let alone thriving. \n\nJust as there are Arab people and Chinese people in the World, one-sixth of humanity is Indian. And politically, this large share of humanity will never conform to a Caliphate or a Marxist Politburo. The Islamic world is also divided between Medieval political ideas and Modernists like in Dubai. \n\nIt is a losing argument to try to push for a new identity among the Indian people. Going to war with the Hindu identity of India is like trying to make the Chinese stop speaking mandarin.

In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord Kṛṣṇa descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam affirms:\n\nnaitat samācarej jātu manasāpi hy anīśvaraḥ                                                                                           \nvinaśyaty ācaran mauḍhyād yathā \'rudro \'bdhijaṁ viṣam\n\nīśvarāṇāṁ vacaḥ satyaṁ tathaivācaritaṁ kvacit                                                                                             \nteṣāṁ yat sva-vaco yuktaṁ buddhimāṁs tat samācaret\n\n"One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered servants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person will perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of Lord Śiva." (Bhāg. 10.33.30)\n\nWe should always consider the position of the īśvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one cannot imitate the īśvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord Śiva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord Śiva who want to indulge in smoking gāñjā (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Śiva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His rāsa-līlā, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many "incarnations" of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.\n\n**Question 1 : Why we can\'t imitate the activities of the Lord and His empowered servants ?

We  have trade deficit with ASEAN of all places. There's something  fundamentally wrong with us. Even with the handicap British raj imposed,  we were producing world class steel in those days and now our  industries can't compete without Government erecting trade barriers?  Bangladesh has bigger footprint in textile market than us? (Question from reddit0r\\_ in a* [great thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hcnu61/boycott_of_chinese_goods_feasibility_discussion/) *on Feasibility of Boycott on Chinese Goods)*\n\n1. This. All sustained weakness comes from miscomprehension of the cause of that weakness. This is why the poor systematically behave in ways that keep them poor. Your core question is fundamental, yet is the one most Indians do not focus on. It feels hard to focus on in the same way that any weak person finds it hard to look directly at what keeps them weak. All the Asian tigers, including China, have focused on this question almost exclusively. Until China under Xi (which will hurt China in the longer term, no doubt about it).\n2. Chinese military strength is purely based on more money. This is dangerous because, in 1962, India had a weak leadership but a roughly equal GDP as China. Today, it has a politically strong leadership but a GDP that is one-fifth of China's. A person who is one-fifth in size cannot fight someone five times bigger alone, unless they have a death-wish (like Saddam Hussein did, like Yahya Khan did against Indira Gandhi in 1971).\n3. There is nothing wrong in boycotting China. Let us do so, let us also impose harsh tariffs on Chinese goods. Have strict Country of Origin labeling laws and make it a criminal offense to falsify these. To not do these things is stupid. But after this is said and done, it will make a relatively small difference. What will make a big difference is economic reform."<br />Author: 'detether'  id: 'hcrf9n'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hcrf9n/core_question_of_china_conflict_and_suggested/</li>

Prevent India from continue building roads/infra on her side which will make salami slicing (through which annexed thousands of sq km in past) difficult B. Threaten India to not completely pivot towards US"<br />Body: "Read this article in full if you have the time. \n\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2020/06/chinas-strategic-assessment-of-the-ladakh-clash/\n\nIf not here are the most pertinent passages. \n\n&gt; Tactically, China wants to put an end to the infrastructure arms race along the border, but strategically is in no hurry to resolve the disputes as it bogs India down as a continental power. China is pushing for the territory occupied in the 1962 war \n\n&gt;  While China is trying to ease the seemingly bottomless deterioration of relations with the United States due to the COVID-19 crisis, India’s road-building is seen as “an attempt to stab it [China] in the back while China was trying to deal with” the United States\n\n&gt; China sees India as being emboldened by its strategic alignment with the United States — articulated by Washington in its Indo-Pacific Strategy. Such emboldening is believed to have directly led to the revocation of Article 370 of India’s constitution in 2019, which removed Ladakh’s limited autonomy and changed it into a Union Territory directly under the central government’s control. The Ladakh Union Territory included Aksai Chin (currently under Chinese authority), and is vital to Chinese control of its “ethnic frontiers” in Tibet and Xinjiang\n\nIn both these paragraphs, notice the language of how China perceives India, as a colony which is only independent for the time being &amp; cannot be allowed to make strategic &amp; geopolitical decisions of their own. India is supposed to do what China wants &amp; if India doesn't obey China, China has the right to attack India. Does it remind you of a certain subservience of Indian left to China &amp; their tradition of suppressing freedom of thought?\n\nTactical near-term goal\n\n&gt;In the near term, China’s tactical objective seems clear —to advance its position roughly to the occupation line by the end of the 1962 war, according to pro-Beijing media outlets. This will push the Chinese presence to the intersection of the Galwan river and the Shyok river, making the Galwan Valley off limits to India. The Chinese construction of posts in this location clearly points to this direction. Indeed, the statement from China’s Western Command after the deadline clash on June 16 confirms this position. It claims that sovereignty over the Galwan valley has always belonged to China. \n\nThe author missed out that capturing Galwan valley will also China a lookout into the DBO road which connects mainland to Siachen, making it essentially worthless. \n\nAuthor admits China is not interested in historical clarification of LAC, but is only looking to capture. Which is true, while also being hypocritical since China brings up history of some old king who lived at some damn time to stake a claim on Tibet, Arunachal &amp; Gosthana (Aksai Chin). \n\n&gt;After all, China is not inclined to accept the “clarification of LAC” based on historical evidence, so the LAC can only be “consolidated” on the ground.\n\n&gt; A border settlement between China and India is unlikely in the foreseeable future, and Beijing believes it has little incentive to push for a quick resolution. China’s priority remains crisis management and escalation prevention, until India is willing to embrace a package deal which basically follows the earlier trade between the eastern section and the western section, with the exception of Tawang. While the Chinese understand the Indian sense of urgency to resolve issues between the two countries, Beijing sees the unsettled border as leverage to bog down India in the region and undermine its global potential. For China, the Chinese and Indian demands are different and asymmetrical by design. Key concessions India demands from China on the border settlement are hard commitments that cannot be reversed. By contrast, what China seeks from India, such as its neutrality in the U.S.-Chinese strategic competition, is ephemeral and easily adjustable. While New Delhi sees addressing the border issue as a prerequisite for India to trust China, Beijing doesn’t believe that relinquishing its leverage will in any way stop India from conducting hostile actions down the road, such as aligning with America to undermine Chinese interests in the Indian Ocean region.\n\n&gt;  tactical gains that can bog India down along the disputed border, frustrate New Delhi’s regional and global ambitions, and remind India of the eventual need for compromise may not be the worst case in China’s cost-benefit analysis. Tactically, China appears to be aiming for what it achieved in the 1962 war."<br />Author: 'Sea_Shrimps'  id: 'hcmdiy'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hcmdiy/good_writeup_on_what_is_chinas_aim_with_current/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The New Global Financial System Rules Must Based On Self Responsibility, Free Choice &amp; Lawless'<br />Body: '**The New Global Financial System Rules Must Based On Self Responsibility, Free Choice &amp; Lawless**\n\nThere are a lot of people with a lot of ideas about the new financial system from few hundreds to few thousands. Every nations, every tribes want some kind of advantage for their group.  \n So it is just waste of time to negotiate for you cannot and never able to have a deal satisfy all.  \n \n\nAnd you cannot continue current corrupt, out-dated financial system any longer for it like the modern slave and not good all all sides.  \n \n\nThe only working solution for all is to have a new global financial economic system based on self responsibility, free choice and lawless. So which mean every nations have the rights to restrict any kind of currency, goods from outside at any moment for whatever reason including just to reduce the inflation rates, stable life, etc.  \n \n\nThe best suitable structure is to have many different groups with different rules so each national government can decide to choose, join and see whether it was the correct policy for their nation for not. For all kind of theory policy is just some words, you can only tell whether it was right or wrong only after see it in real life.  \n \n\nSo the currency rate between those groups will be decide by the public though direct buy/sell.\n\n**Example:**  \n **Group 1:** Currency rate based on inflation rates of staple foods (vegetarian), no minimum wage in at least 50% of land area in each nation.  \n \n\n**Group 2:** Currency rate based on inflation rate of a burger (including meat) at fast food chain, minimum wage equal the smallest money note = 1 dollar per hour in at least 20% of land area.  \n \n\n**Group 3:** Currency rate based on the inflation rate via current rule or via a new public investigation corporation. Minimum wage rule keep as the same\n\n**Group 4**: Currency rate decided by the government and central bank.  \n \n\n**Group 5:** Currency with asset backed like gold, silver, which mean you can exchange the currency notes for gold/silver in certain location.  \n \n\nThe list is various and it depends on each ideology of each nation.  \n \n\nThe beauty of this system is that you just need 2 groups to established to defeat to current IMF system.  \n \n\n**Real life example:**  \n \\- Group 1: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka.  \n \\- Group 2: USA, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina.  \n \n\nYou can made up reasons to setup new system like immigration crisis, protester, border war, etc.  \n \n\nAll the remaining nations must to follow and choose their own group or will lose the trade because it it very easy to cheat the system for there is no currency rate link between each group.  \n \n\nOverall, the new financial system is lawless and free choice for all. And that is the only satisfy answer for all groups, for each entities have their own level of knowledge, understanding, and thinking.  \n \n\nIf you guys want to use this strategy and solution, you must get the permission the Savior legend at first, any entities use it without my approved will only receive disaster by divine angels.  \n \n\nBest Regard,  \n **The Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Kalki Buddha Whatever-Name**  \n \n\nSource: **freejoy.aimoo.com**'<br />Author: 'Sunair_resort'  id: 'hceezu'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hceezu/the_new_global_financial_system_rules_must_based/</li>

People are talking about mental illness and suicide. We should also address the OTHER elephant in the room that 100% played a big role in leading up to his suicide - the bullying, systematic boycott, cold-shouldering, and the ganging up on him. Seems like a universality and reality - a certain group of people will climb the ladder up to elitism in the niche they occupy and thereafter control the whole system down under. We are seeing it EVERYWHERE.\n\nNow normally I never give a crap about celebs/athletes dying because I have let go of celebrity/bollywood/hollywood worship for a decade now. But why do I care about this particular case?\n\nBecause HE WAS ONE OF US.\n\nHe was a kid just like you and me - going the usual path for a South Asian - Doctor/Engineer/Lawyer bano - life set ho jayega. But you know what - he had some massive balls and decided to take a huge risk and take another route. He decided to break the system and chase his dreams. Not to mention how introverted and shy he was inherently. His apartment was full of sci-fi books, he had a fine telescope in his apartment for star-gazing! He was a philosophical and curious person! He was even learning how to code for video games about a few months ago. You also got people coming out speaking of the secret checks worth crores in charity he provided now. Clearly, he was down to earth and did not forget his roots.\n\nHe was relatable - I mean seriously we can actually imagine ourselves having deep conversations with this guy for hours. Can you see yourself having a conversation with say - Sonam Kapoor or Kareena Kapoor? Or our favorites - the Khans other than Amir maybe?\n\nI linked a video of him talk about how he had NO friends in his profession. This is like being harassed in a workplace but worse since you are in showbiz. And of course, no one would be his friends because the whole “industry” is just a big circle jerk and a cliquey of narcissistic, self-absorbed human beings. People like that do not have their feet on the ground and so cannot relate to someone down to Earth. Rather they become territorial and look down on such people who broke the barriers and made it. Not to mention him being darker skinned compared to all these “stars”…\n\nSo why does this matter? Because this ganging up and harassment is a dream killer. He could have been our torchbearer - but now we will have our parents use him as an example to further ensure we do not pursue anything “unusual” for our own safety.\n\nOther than the lobbying that exists in everything nowadays - we are also at fault. Starting from school life to adulthood - we let bullies reign and rather glorify them. We also go gaga over these celebs and put them up on a pedestal - of course then the mainstream media will always just publicize them. Stop worshipping people who ultimately are facades and nothing else. Stop going apeshit just cause Saif Ali Khan’s late child who looks white took a shit. Seriously - read books and get a life.\n\nSo what to do? STOP supporting these garbage movies and celebrities - unfollow their garbage. Stop buying the products they endorse - cause I bet you my left kidney they do not use it themselves. Pay to see movies starring people like SSR, go to the theaters! ALSO DO NOT FORGET - do not FORGET THIS after two months. Why is a murderer like Salman’s movies always a box office hit? I do not watch these horseshit excuses of “movies” for a decade - just try it - your brain will thank you. And if you REALLY have to watch it - torrent it.\n\nAnother very important thing to do: Stand up against bullies, teach your children to. Befriend the kid that is being bullied - EVEN IF HE/SHE IS A WEIRDO. Spank your children if they want to bully - the classic brown way. Start young and in the beginning - so these moral values trickle down into the future.\n\nIts time we start to stand up for ourselves against the elites, pave the way so that we too can pursue dreams and careers that may seem unachievable. The BLM movement is a clear indication that when we are together and not divided - our voices are heard.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL4AHDW2LhY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL4AHDW2LhY)'<br />Author: 'puproductions'  id: 'hccmo4'<br />Score:49<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hccmo4/i_have_no_friends_sushant_singh_rajput/</li>

She was 91 years old and started her journey to heaven this week. It was a peaceful death, however, what made it bad was the fact that my friend, who was a dear grandson and most loved person in her life was not allowed to attend her funeral. Suddenly, some third party (read it government) had put a ban, restriction, a criterion, a price tag on who can attend her funeral. How fair is this? Just because my friend was in another city, and was not a first relationship, he was denied participating in her funeral. Oh yes and BTW that beautiful old lady left 78 lacs of her property on this friend of mine. So thats how close he was to the old lady..... but she was dead... no one asked her... \n\nMy friend got 70% of her property because he took care of the old lady when everyone including her daughter and real son were busy earning their fortune.\n\nSo, the bottom line is, This old lady had put a price tag of 78 Lacs for her death with the only hope of her grandson doing her rituals, but all of that went in vain, was not followed. She was betrayed, she spent 90 years as a great tax paying citizen of India and did the right thing most of the times but was WRONGED during her death, her last days. So 78 Lacs was not enough of a price tag for her death?\n\nDoes Covid rules overpower everything .... just the 1-2 years of Covid phase end up giving so much injustice to the gran ma, to my friend? How is this fair?'<br />Author: 'DevB_Nishabd'  id: 'hc97sq'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc97sq/price_tag_of_death/</li>
      <li>Title::: '[Tip of my tongue] Bollywood movie which references Star Wars lightsabers'<br />Body: 'I remember watching an old Bollywood movie  (late 80s early 90s era movie) featuring Shatrughna Sinha and another side hero character. I only saw the end of the movie where a bunch of goons were skating  and holding tube lights in hand (to attack the hero). Those tubelights sparked on touch, and were clearly poor imitations of light sabres. The movie ends and the credits roll with fireworks happening on a NYC skyline. Looking for the name of the movie. I saw it on zee cinema in 2002 maybe, around hype of Attack of clones'<br />Author: 'bakri_man'  id: 'hc90wm'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc90wm/tip_of_my_tongue_bollywood_movie_which_references/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Question about GST'<br />Body: "I have a question that why is GST hated by people especially CAs? It has really simplified the entire tax filing structure so much that even a person not from commerce background can understand it after a bit of familiarization. I can understand the initial backlash when the system was new and people had trouble with it but now there aren't a lot of problems with that anymore.\n\nIn fact it has made accounting professional's lives easier by reducing their workload. No need to account for all extra stuff like VAT. Even a B.Com. fella can file returns. Why would they hate something that reduces their workload?\n\nI already know political propaganda to oppose it, but I'm more interested in in-depth answer from commerce point of view."<br />Author: 'Electronic_Skirt_808'  id: 'hc6py8'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hc6py8/question_about_gst/</li>
