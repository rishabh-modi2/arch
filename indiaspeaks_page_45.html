We hope that you could become like us; this way the differences between our countries will slowly go away. We could all live in harmony and grow together". \n\nNow BJP seems to have completely turned the tables. The way I see it, India is saying: "We tried to be a good example and a good neighbor, but you people made no effort to give your minorities a better life. So from now on, we won\'t be a good example, we\'ll actively fight for the rights of religious minorities in your countries (and certain ethnic groups in the case of Nepal)". \n\nWhile I agree that Congress achieved very little geopolitically by being so virtuous; perhaps, if BJP was a little bit less obvious in its Hindu &amp; ethnic Indian centrism, it could have more to gain.'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'e9mzvz'<br />Score:36<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e9mzvz/how_do_indias_left_and_right_policies_differ_when/</li>

I\'ve read and watched enough debates on this and the bill makes sense. I read a criticism somewhere that I couldn\'t make sense of, hence asking here.\n\nWhat critics are saying is this bill, by removing the disability of the said religious groups from the said countries to acquire Indian citizenship by naturalization, may in turn be giving a free pass to Indian citizenship to anti-social elements from the said religious groups. In other words, is the bill underestimating that it can be abused / misused on the grounds that these elements are non-Muslim? ... And in that way, is it discriminatory? Then I read that this bill only "enables" these religious minorities to apply for citizenship, but they would still need to go through some Third Schedule of the Citizenship Act 1955 to finally "get" citizenship. What is this step and why will it ensure the CAB does not get abused?\n\nLike I said, I do not need to be convinced of the need for the bill, but just need a logical, rational response to this piece in the puzzle for me.

      <li>Title::: 'Some small bullet-points to counter arguments against Citizenship Amendment Bill (not NRC, just CAB)...'<br />Body: '&gt;1. Why are Muslims like Ahmediyas and Shias excluded? CAB is Anti-Muslim.\n\nFirst of all, they can still seek refuge in India and go through the already established process of naturalization to become a citizen, no one\'s stopping them to do so. CAB is just to PRIORITIZE the persecuted **minority** "religions" in Pakistan, Afghanistan &amp; Bangladesh, because they bear the brunt of the atrocities in these Islamic Theocratic countries.\n\nAnd second, Pakistan already harbors many Afghani Muslim refugees, and as far as Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh are concerned, the persecuted Ahmediyas &amp; Shias are their internal matter. India was divided on the basis of ONE religion - Islam. Now whatever fuck-ups they do over there amongst themselves, that\'s their concern, not ours. Now you will ask : "Then how are the minorities of Pak &amp; BD not their internal matter?" For this, I will say "*context matters*". India was divided, out of which we got Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh - two Islamic Theocratic nations. And Islamic Theocracy is anti-minority, at every form &amp; corner of the world. By CAB, India is rectifying, or rather **completing** the botched job of India\'s Partition (in which several Hindus, Christians, Jains, etc. were left to be then persecuted in those nations). As Amit Shah said, **"This bill is required because India was partitioned on the basis of religion."**\n\n\n&gt;2. Why are the other persecuted minorities like the Sri Lankan Tamils, Balochis, Atheists excluded?\n\nFor the SL Tamils, I\'ll just say : Wait for 2021. BJP, just like other political parties, wants power and hence, they will likely use this to their advantage during the Tamil Nadu state elections in 2021.\n\nFor the Balochis, they want an independent nation of their own (Balochistan), not Indian citizenship. And it is well-known that India supports the Balochi separatists, although not as enthusiastically as Pakistan\'s support for Kashmiri separatists.\n\nFor Atheists, this is my personal opinion, so take it with a pinch of salt : Atheism is not prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, hence, not given much importance.\n\n\n&gt;3. North-East is burning. Why haven\'t they been exempted from this?\n\nTHIS is the only genuine concern regarding CAB - about it\'s impact on Assam &amp; other North-Eastern states. And for this, I hope the government makes provisions to safeguard the languages &amp; the overall culture of the North-Eastern states.\n\nAlso, the government should settle the refugees in low-population states, specifically J&amp;K, instead of the North-Eastern states as these states have already accepted many refugees.\n\n\n\nIf any of you have some other argument against CAB (not NRC, just CAB), I can discuss it too.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. : My own stance on NRC is a bit on both sides. On one hand, it\'s definitely necessary to curb down illegal immigration. On the other hand, NRC &amp; CAB, when used together, can be used to harass INDIAN Muslims who don\'t have proper documents.

Fai and the imam of Kaaba played a pivotal role in introducing the strict Saudi vision \n\nof Islam to Kashmir, which traditionally had been less orthodox. He fled to US to escape being arrested for treason in India and joined Islamic studies at Temple university, where the International Institute of Islamic Thought was founded (which later came under investigation in \n\na federal probe into terrorism funding)  \nAt Temple he joined the ISI, became president of the Muslim students association of US&amp;Canada (Saudi funded division of Muslim brotherhood), and Islamic society of North America. \n\n“in 1989 the ISI picked Fai to run the Kashmiri American Council because he had no overt ties to Pakistan. Similar groups were set up in London and Brussels, the FBI said. Incorporation documents filed in Maryland in April 1990 show Fai was one of three people who established the \n\nKashmir center” and over the next 20 years, became the face of the Kashmir separatist cause in the US.  \n“In 1993, Fai wrote President Clinton about the suffering of Kashmiris, winning news coverage when Clinton wrote back. In 1996, Fai met Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole \n\nat the Republican National Convention. In 2000, he met Clinton in Chicago, just before Clinton visited India. In 2004, Fai testified in front of Burton's subcommittee hearing on human-rights abuses in Kashmir. \n\nEach year, starting in 2003, Fai co-hosted a Kashmir peace conference, usually on Capitol Hill. The 2007 conference drew Pitts, a dozen other members of Congress and Pakistani dignitaries, as well as a handful of Indian and Indian-American human-rights activists and scholars.” \n\nFai admitted that he had been affiliated with the ISI for 15 years.  \nPutting all this into perspective gives us all an understanding of what sort of powerful nexuses exist internationally just to act against Indian interest.\n\n[https://www.propublica.org/article/the-man-behind-pakistani-spy-agencys-plot-to-influence-washington](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-man-behind-pakistani-spy-agencys-plot-to-influence-washington)\n\nIndian “journalists” and “human rights activists” attended Fai’s Kashmir separatist meetings for years. He would sponsor flight tickets and expensive hotels and they would go back and write about this rabid Pakistani agenda in Indian media as if it were “humanitarian” of them. \n\nOne of the indians mentioned was Angana P. Chatterji, a “human rights activist” and “feminist historian” (whatever that means). She wrote a book titled ‘Kashmir: The case for freedom’. Sometimes I wonder how greedy and immoral someone has to be to push so vehemently, Islamic \n\nagenda in our great country that never hurt a fly. But I realise, not that much.

      <li>Title::: 'Need further information on CAB bill'<br />Body: "\nSo with all this mudslinging going around CAB, I wanted to see if I understand correctly what the Government is doing with the passing of this bill. I have put down few points I understood from the bill:\n\n1. This bill is applicable to Illegal migrants who came to India before 2014 .  So this is not applicable for new migrants post 2014\n\n2. Migrants should be from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh . So no Rohingya migrants from Myanmar whether they be Hindu/Muslim/Christian will be allowed who came before 2014.\n\n3. The religion of these migrants should be Hindu,Sikh,Isai(Christian),Jain, Buddhist,Judaism(not sure) and Zorastrianism\n\n4. This isn't applicable on Legal migrants of all religions .\n\n5. As minorities in this country are persecuted in the three countries and had fled it to save themselves hence they are being granted citizenship. \n\nThe things that I am not clear with are the following : \n\n1. What if the Illegal migrant is Muslim and had arrived when Bangladesh was formed in 1971 , as I believe citizenship were provided to the Bangladeshis who came at that time. \n\n2. Where will the Illegal migrants who don't come under the CAB be sent to . \n\n3. What will be the documents provided to migrants who come under the purview of CAB. \n\n4. Why are the Ahmediyas and Shias not considered in this bill when their own religious doesn't consider them muslim. Please don't give me that bs Ahmediyas and Shias did partition so their entire generation should get fucked. \n\nI hope that my understanding is correct, if not please correct me and help understand the changes that need to be made by me.\n\nPlease also help clarify the other 4 points for me aswell. \n\nThanks"<br />Author: 'Hail_Kronos'  id: 'e97cr6'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e97cr6/need_further_information_on_cab_bill/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'AITA for saying rape is not just a crime against women , but men as well?'<br />Body: 'My college conducted an open forum with the topic "Do rapists deserve the death penalty or life imprisonment?" \n\nWhile others were sharing their opinion they kept mentioning rape as a crime that happens just against women, repeatedly stating "The man must be punished", "When a man rapes a woman..." ,"Guys who rape women".\n\nSo when it was time to put forward my opinion , i prefaced it by saying that rape is not just a crime against women and there are men being raped and are not getting attention especially because we don\'t have laws that protect men against this cruel act. After this i moved to the topic at hand and finished my point of view.\n\nWhen i got back to class , a few girls from my class enquired about what i spoke. When i mentioned what i said, they started screaming at me saying "Do you have any idea what\'s it\'s like to be a woman?" , "Do you know how it feels to be judged because of the length of my skirt?" ," Do you feel scared to get out at home during the night?! " "Women are raped far more often than men are!"  \n\nAs soon as they said that last line i replied saying that it doesn\'t mean the men don\'t deserve justice and they just said I\'m wrong.\n\nNow they\'re pretty much ignoring me and it got me wondering if what i said was kind of rude because the reason this open forum came up was the Disha rape case.\n\nTLDR: took part in an open forum where the topic was punishment for rape. Everyone kept mentioning a rapist as a man . When i was sharing my opinion , mentioned that rape is not just a crime against women but men as well. Classmates hate me for my opinion , ignoring me.'<br />Author: 'MisunderstoodBoner'  id: 'e8qons'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e8qons/aita_for_saying_rape_is_not_just_a_crime_against/</li>

But I still can't resist. \n\nDoes everybody here really feel that the need to protect Hindus from other countries really this important? I mean the reason they stayed in other countries is because they had economic or other interests there. They were either landlords, businessmen or from other well-to-do families. Unlike say Muslims who stayed here, who can claim that the political leaders of the time guaranteed them equal rights(your views on the said political leaders and their decisions don't matter, whatever they said or did, they were representatives of the state and its people, like it or not). These said Hindus and other community members knew they were going to be a minority with almost no rights and still they stayed. \n\nThen why should they now become citizens of India? Is everyone really okay with Hinduism being the criteria?\n\nIn the northeast where I stay(not originally from here) there is a 48 hour strike. And I have to say, this is the first time I totally support it. \n\nMy reasons:\n\na. Jobs and employment. Pretty simple. One only needs to look at Mexicans in USA. You don't see people letting them in just because they are Christians.\n\nb. Why Christians? Why can't they go to Vatican city?\n\nc. Has everybody forgot about the overpopulation and the limited resources we have? Shit happens outside our country that is painful and unfortunate. Doesn't mean we need to take the responsibility for it.\n\nd. Indira Gandhi went to war to stop inflow of refugees. Now we can't. We will just have to accept them because it will be in our constitution. The date of 2014 will obviously regularly amended from time to time to extend it.\n\ne. I feel like it is a mistake to try and copy Israel without even a little of the influence Israel has. One only needs to compare the numbers of jews(and people connected with jews) and hindus in US congress.\n\nf. I feel like the only reason it is being done now is because of the debacle the NRC in Assam turned out to be. BJP expected a huge number of muslims, instead a huge majority declared illegal turned out to be Hindus.\n\nThere are some problems that need to be solved right now, and some which can be left alone for future generations. Like PoK, we will one day capture it, but it doesn't have to be right now. It can wait for more favorable conditions. I have the same view about CAB. Govt should have left it and NRC well alone. There were better ways to win election. Simply monitoring the borders well would have stopped further immigration. Say 20 lakh muslims are detected lillegal, what are you going to do with them. Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be taking them back. WIll they be gassed or forever be stuck in Jail?\n\nThe largely ignored strikes in the North-East simply show again that even with BJP, the demands of the north-east will be ignored when required by the center. The media blackout of these protests show that these people can't even expect their voices to be heard by other pillars of democracy. Till last there used to be strikes almost every month. In fact, when I first came here, people joked that band is this area's favourite past time. But finally, this year there were no strikes. I was thinking this might be the first time in history, a whole year will go without a strike. But I thought wrong.\n\nI am very interested in how this thing will pan out in the Supreme Court."<br />Author: 'baddog1994'  id: 'e8li7m'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e8li7m/any_one_here_actually_disagrees_with_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Stop calling it as Union Goverment.. Its the Federal Govt... Lets have a discussion about the terms Union vs Federal..'<br />Body: 'Ok, so I have seen the GoI itself describe itself as a Union Govt and many ministers and news media constantly use the term Union Govt. This annoys me for two reasons:\n\n1. Those who use this term have no idea what it actually means\n2. And that they demonstrate that they are stupid\n\nLets make this clear for once and all - the difference between the terms Union &amp; Federal (like ELI5)\n\nUnion - It means an association of states where every state has to approve a law before it becomes an Union law. The best example is European Union. Any European Law must be individually approved, passsed and ratified by each state before it becomes an European law. Any state can veto it and hold it back. For example, if you want to legalize something like LGBT or Abortion, each state in the union has to approve it, otherwise it wont be considered passed. A union is weak, with lot of bureaucracy, and every law is diluted so deep to make it acceptable by each state. A union has barely, if any, executive power at all. \n\nFederation - The best example is United States. It is also an association of states, but unlike a Union, it has a strong executive powers. The laws of federation trump the laws of State. For example, if the federation sets a minimum wage of $10, the states can only set it higher, never a lower number because it would break the federal law. Similarly, if the federation legalizes abortion, it would take precedence over states\' own abortion law. Even if it was illegal in some states, if the federal law legalizes it, it would override the states law. \n\nNow bring this thinking to India. INDIA IS NOT A UNION. ITS A FRIGGIN FEDERATION. The law of Central Govt (or w.e the hell they want to call it as) takes precedence over the law of state govts. So, why do all these people keep using the term "Union Govt"?'<br />Author: 'chocolate_muffin'  id: 'e8k62g'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e8k62g/stop_calling_it_as_union_goverment_its_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'New Reservation System Model'<br />Body: "I thought about a new model for the reservation system. I just want to know some major potential drawbacks of this system. Do note that I absolutely don't think I am the first person to think of this and understand that many might have done before. Here is how it goes-\n\n* We have already divided citizens into two categories basic categories- reserved and unreserved. Obviously the reserved category will have sub-categories and reservation seats be proportionately divided to accommodate various communities.\n* The crux of the model is that- If a person got a job through reservation, then his/her family would be transferred to the unreserved category. This way, future generations of this particular family would not be able to stake a claim for reserved seats(no matter what institute.)\n* Of course, this doesn't mean their caste or identity will undergo any change. They can still call themselves as a marginalised community. But they won't be able enjoy the special benefits that come along with it.\n* As we continue this process over the years, we would achieve two new goals. First being that the number of people in reserved category is decreased and the second is that those who really need the help of this system are able to benefit from this.\n* I genuinely don't see how the same family can continue to be in the reserved category even thought 2-3 consecutive generations have enjoyed the perks that come with it. Heck, the fact that they can even get into the reservation system for 2 generations in a row adds proof that they don't suffer from socio-economic differences as much.\n* We don't need to continue this system till the number of people in reserved category are 0. After a certain point, once the economic balance between the reserved and unreserved categories are restored, we can drop reservation all together.\n\nNow, I don't think it is politically feasible given how people hate having to lose special perks. But what I do want to know is whether it is an improvement on the present system.

I hear some 2000 Cr of Nirbhaya funds are unused. They need to be put to work.\n\nEvery district needs to have 1 special rape Truck which will be stocked with 2-3 personnel. One admin officer who will register case and automatically link to GPS location of crime. Police station will be allocated based on GPS coords. 1 nurse to conduct tests and record proof of rape claim and one counsellor to provide advise and solace to victim.\n\nI suggest only 1 main reform as a starter. All rape claim needs to have a single video record of the victim detailing the rape. This ensures that the victim doesn't need to relive the experience.\n\nThere should be Govt appointed lawyer who will cross examine the victim to flesh out all details in this video testimony and challenge the events.\n\nAny court case needs to be argued against this video record and if the defendants can defend against this, then they are free to go.\n\nThe victim could also be immediately provided a monthly stipend/loan to cover for expenses or absences from work. This loan will be adjusted with compensation payments made if case is proved. For clearly proved false rape cases, the amount needs to be paid back plus additional penalties for wasting resources.\n\nVictim will also be given the option to relocate to a safe area for rehabilitation if she requests it.\n\nAny other suggestions?"<br />Author: 'exotictantra'  id: 'e82kkd'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e82kkd/suggestions_on_handling_rape_claims_to_ensure/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Somebody is hell-bent on closing down the T-18 project. Who, the import lobby? Government?'<br />Body: 'First they said that the trains had energy efficiency problems. They said that it they were overweight. Or they did not follow tendering rules. Every excuse is being made to scrap this project so that it can go to an external player who will do screwdriver assembly in India.\n\nThe fact is the trains were built in record time, under-budget and being essentially prototypes they have worked without a flaw for a year! A truly shining example of not only make in India, but researched and developed in India. Essential parts like the traction motors were made by private Indian companies like Medha. \n\nIt is a very good product for India because it can connect many cities in 3-4 hr radiuos at Shatabdi speeds but at much lower cost since there is no need to buy a locomotive or the added costs of maintaining it and keeping it in loco sheds. T-18 is a like fast local between any two cities or multiple cities. And way cheaper than Alstom or Bombardier. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut how this project is being killed in the full glare of the government and railway minister is shocking. Some excerpts from various newspapers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; One of the main reasons why the Indian Railways decided to halt the production of Train18 rakes at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) here is that the self-propelled train set is heavier and consumes more power compared to Shatabdi Express on the same route and speed, according to a note prepared by the Railway Board. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; In a separate but related development, Chief Administrative Officer, Rail Wheel Plant, Bela, Shubhranshu, has written to the Chairman, Railway Board, that the axle load of Vande Bharat was less than 17 tonnes, which was similar to world-class trains \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The self-propelled train set, comprising 16 air-conditioned coaches, was built at a cost of ₹100 crore, about half the estimated cost of importing such a rake, with about 80% indigenous components in alignment with the Prime Minister’s call for ‘Make in India’. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The Railway Board has decided to import 60 train sets (960 coaches) from global manufacturers at more than double the cost required to manufacture Train-18 by ICF, sources said. At a conservative estimate, including 10-year maintenance cost, the total allocation would be between Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 35,000 crore, officials said. “Train 18 was manufactured at Rs 100 crore. Nobody was willing to bid for Train 20 at even Rs 200 crore. So, minimum cost for the imported train sets will be Rs 250 crore,” said a senior railway official. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The entire ‘A’ team of the Integrated Coach Factory (ICF) behind India’s first semi-highspeed train Vande Bharat – toasted around the country not so long ago as a symbol of a new India – is now faced with the threat of a vigilance inquiry.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nine officers, each integral to turning out the train – popularly called Train 18 – at record low costs and within challenging deadlines, have been sent a questionnaire seeking justifications for decisions taken by them as far back as 2016 at the ICF.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**At least one of the nine officers has written to Chairman, Railway Board, V K Yadav, calling the questionnaires a vendetta and an attempt to “sabotage the Vande Bharat” project, one of the “greatest make-in-India success stories.”**  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The officer has alleged that while the ICF is being accused of delays on the one hand, on the other the Research Design and Standards Organisation  \n(RDSO) has changed the specs for new Vande Bharat trains to such an extent that it has made meeting deadlines impossible. Calling the threat of a  \nvigilance inquiry an attempt at “fixing officers”, the officer says he fears this will “kill the Vande Bharat initiative forever.”  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Railway Board, in response to mail sent by Mirror, said the questionnaires were sent after receiving a number of complaints against the officers and after an investigation by the vigilance department noted “irregularities in the procurement of propulsion system for EMU/MEMUs (suburban trains) and Train 18.”  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The nine officers facing the heat are – Sudhanshu Mani, who retired as general manager, ICF; S P Vavre, ex-chief design engineer electrical, ICF, and  \ncurrently principal chief electrical engineer, Central Railway; N K Gupta, principal chief electrical engineer, ICF; S Srinivas, chief planning engineer, ICF;Amitabh Singhal, senior administrative grade officer, IFC; Kanwaljeet Asla, head of finance and accounts and chief administrative officer, project, ICF; L C Trivedi, ex-principal chief mechanical engineer, ICF, now general manager, East Coast Railway; Shubhranshu, ex-principal chief mechanical engineer, ICF and currently chief administrative officer, Rail Wheel Factory, Bela; and D P Dash, ex-chief design engineer, electrical, ICF, who currently holds charge as senior administrative grade officer, East Coast Railway.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The officer who has written to the chairman, Railway Board, has also alleged that the threat of vigilance action against the nine officers is an attempt to get international companies involved in the manufacturing of semi-high speed trains. The letter says that he is aware of an “import proposal for 60 semihigh speed trainsets costing over Rs 25,000 crore” **which cites “delays in manufacturing of Vande Bharat trains at ICF.”**  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The officer is referring to a proposal dated August 19, 2018 prepared by the Railway Board for the involvement of foreign players in the manufacturing of Train 18-type trains in India that weigh slightly less than the Vande Bharats.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mirror is in possession of the letter written by the angry officer to the Railway Board and a copy of the Railway Board proposal to get foreign  \nmanufacturers involved in the Vande Bharat project. Interestingly, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has often tweeted his admiration for the team behind the Train 18 success. In October this year, he tweeted that Vande Bharat has become a symbol of self-confidence in India. “The trainset meets the best of international standards and is entirely an accomplishment of Indian engineers. I bow before the hard work of these people,” he wrote.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Board, however, does not seem to share his view. One of the officers who has received the questionnaire said the feeling is that the ICF is “under siege”. He has every small decision he and his colleagues took is being questioned. “It is a shock. After being feted for our work, suddenly aspersions are being cast on our integrity,” he said.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another officer under scrutiny said he has been asked 24 questions, each related to decisions he took in connection with tenders issued during his time at ICF. “What is the message being sent – is it a crime to take decisions? Or is it that all the praise that Vande Bharat received is working against us now? **And why is this talk of involving foreign manufacturers.** Is Vande Bharat a success or is it not?” he asked.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A senior serving railway officer, who did not wish to be identified, said the notices are a clear case of witch-hunt. “If this inquiry goes ahead, why would any officer go out of his way to get things done fast? This will only instill a sense of fear among officers and slow down the decision making in the railways,” he said.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'e7ul21'<br />Score:66<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e7ul21/somebody_is_hellbent_on_closing_down_the_t18/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Ending the increasing incidence of rapes'<br />Body: "This is going to be a rather long post and that's necessary.\n\n# An Unending cycle\n\nI was a college student when Nirbhaya rape happened and the gruesomeness created a huge turmoil in all Indians. There were mass protests, candle marches and it became global news. The Law Commission sat on this issue and the legal punishments were made stricter, fast track courts and all kinds of bells and whistles were sounded.   \nEveryone hoped that situation would change and that no girl ever would have to go through that again. The media had gone on a rape reporting spree and it seemed that the entire society was full of rapists and that no one could ever be safe again. This was important to bring out the plight of women and to sensitize the society at large.\n\nHowever, almost a decade later the same cycle is repeating almost in a similar manner. Governments have changed, settings have changed and so have the details of gruesomeness. But we have little in the way of how things can change. We have similar talks of increasing the quantum of punishments and fast track courts and the like coupled with sensitivity  training etc. This however, is not new and if we are to look at the example of west, things are not going to change but rather become more the norm. So much so that stories of abuse and rapes would stop churning our conscience. \n\n# Where's the solution?\n\n*The solution lies in* ***stemming the tide of individualism and a social rollback towards spiritualism while promoting no slack in duty.***\n\n&gt;**The basic cause for not just rapes but all crime is the desire to possess and enjoy.** \n\nIt starts small &amp; innocuously with simple eating and drinking and making merry all within bounds of legitimacy.   \nWith either the increase in one's power (real or assumed) or an increase in this self-serving attitude, the tendencies (&amp; hence one's acts) soon transcends bounds of legitimacy. \n\nNow, to get something which belongs to someone else (i.e., their possession) comes naturally. This can be seen in simple acts of stealing or bribery and even something as large as tax evasion.   \nHowever, gradually this goes from simple possessions like say a candy or a watch to something like someone's very body itself.   \n\n\n***The basic instinct remains the same which is of taking something that doesn't belong to one's own self for the simple reason of giving pleasure to oneself.***\n\n# What prevents crime? --  Checks\n\nThere are two kinds of checks\n\n  \nThe **External Checks** which include fear of law and of social banishment. When fear of law is taken away or when one feels that they're too smart for law to catch-up to them, such people will violate someone.\n\nThe **Internal Check** is primarily the logical mind which vetoes any decision which could end up causing long term insurmountable losses like incarceration and bad name, etc. However, any circumstance which takes away mental capacity to differentiate and analyse course of actions will also remove the internal checks. This is why almost all rapists are alcoholics or drug abusers (though I don't claim vice-versa).  \n\n\nRape is a crime which is also happens due to the confluence of two things\n\n* the desire for pleasure at any cost\n* the absence (real or perceived) of checks\n\nThis is not just about the rapes which happen in social settings but also which happen within the confines of homes aka marital rape. Even further lies an extreme kind is sexual cruelty as witnessed in Nirbhaya case and now in the Telangana case in which the act gives sadistic pleasure. After the act is over, since the body of woman can't give any sadistic pleasure anymore and becomes a liability, it's dumped in various ways. In this case it, the perpetrators burnt off the body. \n\nSince, India has far too many people and too few justice system resources (also because govt funds are already spread thin), the external checks will not work by themselves alone, atleast not in the short to medium term. They'll work only for the conscientious folks who are anyway checked internally but their minds and morals. \n\n**As far as external checks is concerned**, \n\n* there is a ***need to increase the quantum of punishment towards something that's really painful*** rather than the quick deaths of hanging by a noose. Death by a hanging is virtually snap death which in itself isn't very frightening for a perpetrator who is anyway pretty sure of escaping the law. The punishment should be such which makes a person shudder to even think of getting it even by a mistake.\n\n**The long term solution however lies in increasing the focus towards building internal checks.**\n\n* It is often called for that mothers (and parents generally) teach their sons to behave properly with women. This should absolutely happen. But this remains hamstrung because in the modern society of nuclear families, parents aren't able to give time to their kids who are left to fend for their lessons from popular media and curriculum. Bring porn and the general objectification of women in Film and other media into the picture and the only message which gets across is that women are desirable objects of pleasure and nothing else. Moreover, even the desires get channelized into very specific and abusive ways via the agency of porn. \n\nAnother popularly quoted solution is promoting sex-ed in school and co-ed schooling. \n\n* While co-ed is useful in promoting a sense of comfort around the other gender, simply being in the company of the other sex doesn't directly address the dilapidation of mind or does enough to prevent it. \n* Sex-ed for the most part is about healthy sexual habits and removing misconceptions and therefore too doesn't go as far as is needed to create internal checks in young minds.  \n\n\nIn my opinion, an introduction to Vedantic principles early in the childhood can help immensely. \n\n* If taught well and early, it would mould a child's views towards a universal identity rather than a small body based identity. \n* If that is the case the primacy given to the pleasure of one's own body is reduced and the sensitivity towards one's surroundings (including fellow humans) is increased manifold. \n* With such a foundational base, there are also other benefits which include the development of a strong inner-self which will help also with the rising depression rates amongst students and youth. However, that's a different subject.\n\nSince, the institution of family remains compromised as far as giving values is concerned, introduction of these teachings into the curriculum is of utmost necessity. That would also ensure that every child gets the foundation right.\n\n***One may ask that if students aren't even able to imbibe language and arithmetic in schools, will they be able to imbibe Vedantic principles at all?***\n\n* **The answer is that its not about understanding at all.** \n* Young minds are very impressionable and even if the impression isn't truly understood in all its depth, the impression itself is very strong to drive behaviour. For example, children who are taught to not do something from the very childhood owing to parent/teachers direct commands, simply can't bring themselves to doing it life-long. \n* This is a very well known **psychological principle** of ***Ego-States***. A child ego-state doesn't allow one to do forbidden activities even in adulthood.  \nIt is this principle that we ought to utilize if we are to make a difference to the prevalent social conditions.\n\nPlease feel free to discuss and add suggestions."<br />Author: 'pucksee'  id: 'e6l8l2'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e6l8l2/ending_the_increasing_incidence_of_rapes/</li>

Further more they have made it their personal agenda by putting out  tweets and articles that distorts from what was said by any of the BJP MPs. If one actually  looks at the statements  made by the MPs in full context than they may not sound so arrogant or ridiculous.  Further more not a single attention has been given to heinous rape crimes in Rajashthan, Tamil Nadu, Kerela or Bengal. Not a single attention has been given to why the onion prices are soaring and what the government  is doing to curb the prices( Imported 10000 ton of onion from Egypt and Turkey, further imports may follow). But they're openly talking shit about the government  and then playing the victim card of fear. A criminal walked out of jail and was given a hero's welcome all while everyone knows the massive losses India faced under in nose. The media tried to play this as the  environment  is really scary and we can't  speak up yet they're  openly  criticizing  the government  and personally attacking Modi for Article 370, Gst, Demo. If this is not a hypocrisy  than I don't  what is. Our economy is going from a black market to a transparent market where the government  along with the agency can check for companies  indulging  in corruption, tax collection is increased and tax evasion is reduced. Every tender that is filled or any contract that is given out is visible and the why the contracts were awarded to certain companies is also out in open. There is no more corruption  in contract handout or favours. If this is not what India needs then I don't  know. Lies about everything  are being spread by media please have faith in the current government and don't  fall for the gimmick all these parties are trying to do.

And instead of realizing despite being behind and low budget ISRO does an amazing job, but no, they just make fun like "USA did it 60 years ago, india can\'t do it even now" do they not realize USA failed too many times, countries don\'t share their tech, and most countries can\'t even freaking reach the orbit.\n\nAlso, they make fun of indians not having toilets, sometimes I wonder if they are actually stupid enough to think even urban indians don\'t have toilets, and why do they even make fun of it, instead of understanding the poverty and lack of infrastructure in our country and the reasons behind it thy just make jokes on it. I don\'t see anyone making jokes on Africa\'s poverty, and that is a good thing, but people on reddit joke about India\'s lack of toilets or some people\'s lack of english speaking skills (bob and vagene .\\_.) even though most of china, Korea, japan etc can\'t even speak english.\n\nrecently I saw this meme about something related to shitting, and the comment section erupted with shitting in open jokes on india, even though it happens in many african, south asian and south eastern nations, India is the only one that gets memed on.\n\nsame for space, instead of realising ISRO\'s good job, they just make fun Vikram failure completely ignoring the failures and deaths NASA has in its record.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow why I considered the possibility it is only an illusion:the number of people who saw the meme, news post etc, are obviously greater than the number of upvotes it has, while the number of comments was usually around 300, half of which were "normal" comments, that gives us 150 comments, half of which were reply by indians, that gives us 75 comments about making fun on india, compared to the more than 20k upvotes (and thus even more views) which means the fun on india to views ratio is actually very low \'-\'So, I just considered the possibility that the india haters, stupid people, and trolls in general use these few posts to make fun of India, which results in the india joke and anti-india from all over reddit gathering at one place, which just gives the illusion that there are a lot of anti-india people, while in fact there are very few and them getting condensed in one place makes it feel as if there are a lot of them.\n\nthird and last, why I considered the possibility that perhaps I am just too much triggered:people on internet make jokes, perhaps they only mean it lightly (the bob vagene and shitting in open jokes, and the scam call jokes, vikram failure jokes obviously stems from ignorance and stupidity) and not as seriously as I take them.

This is utter nonsense guys,  why are we repeating the same mistake that congress did? Congress allowed bangladeshi(mostly muslims) and others to enter india and get settled which meant lost land, job opportunities, culture mismatch for the locals and in many parts the locals even had to leave their homes and riots. So when BJP came out with NRC we all supported the decision thinking our countrymen will get their due worth. But now, if this amendment bill gets through which most likely will, it will allow the refugees to settle in our country again just different people but what about our own countrymen? Already the overall job condition is so bad,  think about the lost jobs, lands or possibly more riots? All this for what? Just to gain more votebank in north east? Can you imagine just how outraged the north eastern people may get after that(was just talking to my NE friend), they were happy cos BJP drove away the refugees but now they are repeating the same thing again. So lets have a polite conversation here, why is this bill any good? I personally think this a very bad idea just to get votebank and this comes in the backdrop of recent drama in Maharashtra when bjp chose that curropt af ajit pawar to be deputy CM.

      <li>Title::: '[FICTION] Trapped (Ch1)'<br />Body: 'Hi, everyone! Thanks to u/Kontrolling for the encouragement and u/drm_wvr for granting me the permission to write the story. Also, thank you, u/Orwellisright, for providing your support.\n\n**Synopsis**: It all starts with an eight-year old girl who carries more trauma than a child should carry. Life\'s not a bed of roses and thorns accompany them in abundance, yet every ending marks a new beginning. \n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nThe dim moonlight trickled through the ajar window, lighting the room with a soft glow. The ever so still air seemed restless tonight, swished through the silent valleys, stirring the tree leaves and caused a gentle mayhem in the world outside my room. The evening was charged with the sweet fragrance of the shrubs and wet earth, resulted from the drizzle a few hours ago. The weather had, once again, become cold. July, in most parts of the country, was supposed to be a hot, humid month, but we had the privilege of spending most of the year in chilling cold and continuous rains.\xa0\n\n\nTonight, it was one of those days when silence reigned over the house, and all the experiences mentioned above had intensified manifold. I tried to close my eyes and fall asleep, but unrest boiled up, clawing its way to my thoughts and conjuring the hideous images of a reality I was so terrified of. In hope of not dreaming anything unnatural again, I chose not to sleep for the night.\xa0\n\n\nYou have your school tomorrow.\n\n\nA voice warned me. I knew it. But how many nights had I spent sleepless so the morning brought some hope? It was always better in the morning: an exhausted day was better than the dreadful nights full of nightmares and monsters I could not cope with. As the night passed, my worries could rest until the next night came. And the moment I reached home in the evening, the dreadful sensations would crawl back, tearing like the sharp razors ready to cut the skin. Today was the last day of the one-month vacation and I had happily spent the entire month at my grandmother\'s place. It was this morning that I was came back to my parents\' home. When I arrived, dad had already left for the office and Ma was yet to return from the camp she had taken her students to. When I called her, she said she would be home by the evening. Suddenly, I missed my grandma. She was the sweetest woman I had ever known and I could never imagine myself living in a world where she wouldn\'t be there. I remembered the first day of the vacations and my visit to her place. She had hugged me and cried, asking me why I took so long to visit her. And I\'d spent the afternoon with her as she cooked food for both of us and then, in the evening, we watered the small garden she had worked on. It was heaven. Now when I thought of it, the time had passed too quickly with her around.\n\n\nI snapped from the memory as the sound of the wind swirling reached me again. I turned over and covered myself with a blanket to shield myself from the assault of cold the breeze suddenly brought. When Ma had come home, it was 30 minutes past ten, and dad was yet to come back. I was already on my bed, tired from the day\'s journey and waiting for Ma. Ruchi, our housemaid, had tucked me in bed before she headed to her home. There were no conditions for her to stay back past nine at night regardless of my parents having returned back or not. That night, however, she made an exception, saying she, too, had missed me when I was away and we needed to make up for the lost time.\xa0\n\n\nWhen Ma returned, I had waited for her to open the door and tiptoe into my room as I prepared to sleep. I expected her to give me a hug and caress my forehead, murmuring in low voices she loved me and missed me. I had expected her to ask if I had had my dinner. After all, it was the first time I stayed away from home for one month with hardly any contact with my parents. But as I snuggled in the blanket, shivering, and hoping for the door to creak open, nothing happened. I heard the low sounds of the dishes being chafed together coming straight from the kitchen until the sounds died. Soon after, dad came, too, but there was still silence outside my room.\xa0\n\n\nThey\'re just tired.\n\n\nI told myself again and again and sighed deeply. But who I was lying to?\n\n\nYou know the truth.\n\n\nYes, I did.\n\n_______\n\n\nIt was Ruchi\'s voice that woke me up in the morning; her sweet voice that felt like a balm on my cold bruises.\n\n\n"Naina, get up! You have your school!"\n\n\nI rubbed my eyes, looked around me until my gaze halted at the clock and realized it was six thirty already. "Oh, no! I\'ll be getting late!"\n\n\n"Calm down." She appeared at the doorstep and laughed. "You look cute like that."\n\n\n"How?"\n\n\n"Your morning tousled hair. They make you look like you\'ve returned from a battle. So much for an eight-year-old, eh?"\xa0\n\n\nI smiled back sheepishly. It was true indeed. My long hair always ended up getting tangled whenever I slept through the night, and that was the reason I would always cut them short enough to look like a boy. Grandma never approved that and visiting her this summer was the precise reason I had allowed them to grow shoulder length. They were now long enough to exasperate me all the time.\xa0\n\n\n"You better not cut them again, okay?" Ruchi said.\xa0\n\n\nI sighed. "It might not work for me."\n\n\n"How about we both make it work? You don\'t like others touching your hair, understood. But can you, for once, just try it yourself?" She was smiling warmly.\xa0\n\n\nI couldn\'t refuse. "I think I can." I shrugged.\xa0\n\n\n"Okay, come on! Your breakfast is ready. Ma\'s waiting downstairs for you."\xa0\n\n\nI nodded and went ahead to get ready. The first day at school after the vacation was always exciting.\xa0\n\n\nMa sat in the dining room, chewing her breakfast and glancing at the newspaper as though she was eagerly looking for something. I walked past the chair she sat on and settled next to her. I looked out of the window; the sun was barely up, still gliding behind the towering hills. The slight view in the eastern sky rejoiced in the warmth of red and orange; a sight common every day before the sun climbed out by the afternoon. I looked for Ruchi. She was still not in sight. And then, my gaze fell on my mother who hadn\'t yet taken notice of my presence. Few painfully silent moments passed in which my imagination took me out of the room and into the worlds unknown. In the worlds where no boundaries existed and I was free.\xa0\n\n\nOh, how I imagined the life to be those days.\xa0\n\n\n"Hey, girl, you\'re here!" Ruchi appeared from the kitchen door, her hands full of food trays she was carrying. It was then Ma looked in my direction and I heard her sigh. I stood up to help Ruchi who thanked me as we placed the trays on the dining table. I looked at Ma who was now busy solving the Sudoku in the paper. She loved doing that, and if I could recall it correctly, she often finished the puzzles within three minutes. However, it was today she was taking this long. Five minutes had already passed and she was still struggling. And it was no use disturbing her doing that.\xa0\n\n\n"Why aren\'t you eating, Naina?" Ruchi asked.\xa0\n\n\n"I- I don\'t feel hungry."\n\n\n"All for your regular tantrums. Come on. Finish it. You\'re supposed to be going to school. The bus will be here any minute."\n\n\nThe thought of missing the bus and staying home entire day made my stomach lurch. I gulped and sucked in a deep breath. It was enough motivation for me to finish the breakfast and rush to the school. While I was finishing my breakfast, Ma stood up, walked past me, and gave us a smile.\xa0\n\n\n"I\'ll be late today. Don\'t wait up for me, okay?" Her gaze shifted between Ruchi and and I impatiently. As soon as Ruchi nodded her head, Ma was out and I heard the sound of the car\'s engine whirring and then gradually fading when she was finally away. Ruchi watched me with pity and gave an awkward smile before moving ahead to finish the rest of the work. I never understood why she would look at me that way until I was old enough to understand things.\xa0\n\n________\n\n\n"You sure you can go?" Shelly asked me. She was the younger sister of my tuition teacher, and a good friend of mine, albeit five years older than me. I was one of the younger kids taking tuitions from her brother who also happened to be a teacher at my school. The family never understood why I had to be the one taking tuitions at all in the first place, provided I had educated parents, Mom a teacher herself- one of the only few working women in the town. However, they never minded taking me in and that was always a relief.\xa0\n\n\n"Yeah, I can," I answered. Tonight I was later than usual and the bulbs were out, the only light coming from the crescent moon in the sky. The path from Shelly\'s home to mine was risky to go on foot at night. But I got used to it and it was not a concern to me. After assuring her that I could go on without landing myself into any trouble, I walked towards my home, humming to myself a tune I had learned a few days ago. The sun had gone down while I was still at her home. It was a birthday party of Shelly\'s niece, the daughter of my teacher, and they wanted us to join along as well.\xa0\n\n\nIt felt good to be accepted somewhere.\xa0\n\n\nWhen Shelly saw me in the evening, she squealed like a little girl and could hardly wait for my class to get over. Once that happened, she took me by my wrist and showed all that she had done in her vacations and how her family was happy for the progress she was making in extracurricular activities along with her studies. She then asked me about my time with my grandma and laughed when I told her how the sight of wild animals was quite common in that region.\xa0\n\n\n"I\'ve always wanted to see a panther, you see." She laughed.\xa0\n\n\nShe had developed a mild crush on Black Panther ever since she read the comics six months ago and that was partly the cause of her wanting to see only a panther in the woods.\n\n\n"Uh ohh? I hope you see one someday."\xa0\n\n\nOur conversation drifted to other things until the party got over and I was on my way home. Ma would be waiting, I told myself, and hurried. The rest of the path passed in a jiffy as I scurried amidst the harsh blows of cold wind assaulting my face, and halted when the building of the house became visible from the distance. I wondered if Ruchi would be home.\xa0\n\n\nAs soon as I clicked open the door, I was greeted with loud voices of my parents. Ma and Dad were arguing over something. Again. Dad said something. It was a demanding voice. Ma was quiet, still. He said it again. Loud. She didn\'t answer. He yelled. Louder this time. With slow, careful steps, I trudged towards their room, dread creeping inside, as though this moment was foreshadowing something I didn\'t want to think.\xa0\n\n\nI froze in place when I heard Ma say my name, followed by the words I could not decipher. It was far from being affectionate. Rather, she sounded furious, disgusted. My heart hammered in my chest and I could not breathe. A sense of dread settled in and I suddenly regretted returning home at all.\xa0\n\n\nWhy couldn\'t I stay away for a few more hours? Or forever?\xa0\n\n\nThe fights between Ma and Dad were common. Unnaturally common. Though no one outside home ever suspected that: to the people away from this sphere, my mother and father were an ideal couple and I, their happiest child. Until a few years later, grandma, too, couldn\'t think of anything of this kind. I had overheard Ma and Dad several times use my name midst of their heated arguments, though I could not make out what that meant. The way Ma said my name, I couldn\'t stop wondering.\n\n\nDid they hate me?\n\n\nMa and Dad always denied that they hated me, though. Still dumbfounded at the things I had just witnessed, I turned to my room. I wasn\'t hungry, but now sleep, too, had abandoned me. Once again. I could still hear the sound of my parents arguing and closed my door as tightly as I could and jumped into my bed, covering my ears with the pillow so no sounds ever reached me. In another room, Ma and Dad still argued while I found my cheeks wet with tears. I had no strength left to lift my hand and dash the tears away, so I let them be. I didn\'t want this night to pass in the same fear like the last one. They didn\'t argue yesterday, because they were not present at home at the same time. But tonight was different.\n\n\nI sighed and rolled on my back, hoping I could sleep peacefully. Or, if I was lucky enough, I wanted to be near my grandma. I missed her terribly.\xa0\n\n\nLittle did I know, a few years from now on, the wish would certainly be granted.\xa0\n\n\n__________\n\nAuthor\'s Note: To anyone that read, thank you.

      <li>Title::: 'The Indian media and Rape'<br />Body: 'The Indian media is to blame for Indian men being universally labeled as gang rapists. No other country has hundreds of hysterical English-language media outlets that turn every rape and every grizzly detail of that rape into breaking front-page news for the whole world to see.\n\nIn most other countries rape is almost only mentioned in the local language and in local (city-wide or otherwise subnational) news outlets making it harder to go viral and for international news outlets like BBC, CNN and NYT to cover the story.\n\nRape in Western countries are mostly covered by [local news outlets](https://i.redd.it/n80cx2cjjzw21.png) and they avoid all the macabre and noticeable details.\n\nLets look at how Western countries cover rape cases: In Missouri, USA a [woman was abducted, drugged and gang raped for several days](https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Four-men-charged-with-kidnapping-raping-Springfield-woman-for-days-in-Lawrence-county-559758921.html). This Missouri case was only mentioned in a few local (city/state) news outlets. None of them have used the term "gang rape" about the incident. Not a single big US media outlet has reported on the incident. It\'s almost like they don\'t want the rest of the world to hear about it.\n\nHere is another example: [These four men in Kentucky, USA recently gang raped a girl and filmed it](https://www.wkyt.com/content/news/4-Kentucky-men-ages-18-or-19-indicted-on-rape-charges-513139531.html). The term "gang rape" is not used at all in the article. Instead of writing that the men filmed their gang rape the article only used the term "video voyeurism". This Kentucky case was also never mentioned in the big American news outlets.\n\nIn India both of these rape cases would be front-page breaking news on IndiaToday for the whole world to see.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. The Indian media sucks.\n\n2. The Indian English-language media sucks and has made the whole world hate India and especially Indian men.'<br />Author: 'azidd'  id: 'e57mii'<br />Score:117<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e57mii/the_indian_media_and_rape/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The state of Indian Engineers.'<br />Body: "So I have been thinking a lot lately why India fails to produce good quality engineers en masse. The majority of engineering graduates in India are below average, to say the least.\n\nThe reasons for this are many-fold. There are a lot of issues plaguing engineers in India, the major of which (IMO) are:\n\n1. **Lack of comprehension/communication:** India may be the only major country in which the entirety of the higher education in the technical field is conducted in a foreign language, i.e., English. Majority of the students entering into engineering colleges have a very poor background in the language. Some of them encounter the language as a medium of teaching only in college. At this age it becomes very difficult for these students to comprehend the highly technical jargon used in the field, and they don't have enough time to catch up on their deficient language skills. Most prefer to go for sub-standard local books as references, as they use easy to understand English. The students are thus unable to make use of the best available resources.  \nIn the work setting, only about 1 in 50 engineers are able to write proper emails, correspondence or reports. The engineers working in a project frequently have no idea of the scope of the project, thus performing useless tasks and driving costs up.\n2. **Educational Structure:** Engineering college faculties in India prefer to hand out notes, photocopies etc. instead of encouraging the students to learn about the concept and ask the teachers any questions that they have. The assignments that these colleges give to a student just  makes them a glorified photocopying machine. Engineering college laboratories have managed to make a human being, namely the student, into an automation which performs complex tasks, an achievement which still eludes other universities in the world.\n3. **Lack of funding:** Barring a few disciplines, technology has progressed so much that to conduct new and productive research, students and faculties need funds running into figures that a college/sponsor is rarely able to provide.  \nThere are talented people in our institutes, but they don't take up research which may result in a patentable technology owing to the paucity of funds.\n4. **Mentality:** Most Indian engineers are an apathetic lot. They don't keep abreast of new developments in and outside their fields, both as a student and as a working professional. This has a direct impact on their thinking, which is stuck in a rut, and rarely ventures out of the tried and tested formula.\n\nWhat do you think are the other issues that Indian engineers are facing?"<br />Author: 'SriHattiya'  id: 'e522xb'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e522xb/the_state_of_indian_engineers/</li>

The animal instincts become high. \n\nI’m a teetotaller but once I experienced the high that alcohol gives, in college.  \n\nEnforcement of age bar to drinking is hardly done in India.

Topics of discussion do not have to be related to India. Here are some stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood\n\n1. [Big win for pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong elections](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/25/what-happened-hong-kong-elections/)\n\nDistrict Council elections in Hong Kong delivered a thumping victory for pro-democracy candidates, who won about 90% of all seats in a setback to Beijing. The move is largely symbolic since the district councils have little power, but it serves as a warning to Beijing. Separately, the US President approved a bill mandating the State Department to monitor human rights abuses in Hong Kong, which led to pro-US \'Thanksgiving\' rallies in the territory. Beijing condemned US interference in its internal affairs, but did not stop trade negotiations with the US, indicating the difficult position it finds itself in.\n\n2. [US-Taliban negotiations resume](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/us-taliban-talks-informal-negotiations-resume-191129120557425.html)\n\nIn a surprise visit to US troops in Afghanistan, US President Donald Trump announced that his country had restarted peace negotiations with the Taliban. This was later confirmed by the Taliban itself, which stated that negotiations would resume from the point at which they were called off in September by the US. Back then, the US had decried a series of attacks in Afghanistan and is now requiring a ceasefire before any peace deal can come into force.\n\n3. [Protesters torch Iranian consulate in Iraq](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/28/783585325/in-iraq-iranian-consulate-torched-and-security-forces-fire-on-protesters)\n\nIn a sign of Iran\'s weakening hold on the so-called Shia Crescent, the Iranian consulate in the Iraqi city of Najaf - a holy city for Shias - was torched by a mob protesting against Iran\'s interference in Iraq\'s politics. The protesters are part of a long-running agitation against Iraq\'s government over corruption and economic mismanagement, and is concentrated in major cities in the south. Dozens of people have been killed so far, and the Iraqi PM has stepped down as a result.\n\n# Top 3 stories from around the world:\n\n1. [Brazil\'s President blames Leo DiCaprio for Amazon fires](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/leonardo-dicaprio-brazil-president-amazon-forest-fires)\n\nIn a bizarre accusation, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who will be the Chief Guest at India\'s 2020 Republic Day parade, accused actor Leonardo DiCaprio of giving millions of dollars to NGOs to start fires in the Amazon this past summer to purposely create outrage against his government and grab land. This follows raids by Brazilian police on two NGOs accused of the same. The actor has denied the allegations.\n\n2. [North Korea calls Japanese PM an \'idiot\' after missile tests](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/11/30/north-korea-shinzo-abe-warns-future-missile-launch-japan/4339816002/)\n\nNorth Korea\'s foreign ministry released a statement, calling Japanese PM Abe Shinzo an \'idiot\' and a \'political dwarf\' after the Communist country tested new ballistic missiles. The Japanese PM had convened an emergency meeting of officials and condemned the tests as a "grave challenge to the international community." The statement also threatened Japan with a \'real\' ballistic missile in the future. Negotiations between North Korea and the US, which guarantees Japan\'s security, have not restarted after breaking down in the last round of discussions.\n\n3. [Danish intelligence claims China militarizing the Arctic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-arctic/china-mixing-military-and-science-in-arctic-push-denmark-idUSKBN1Y3116)\n\nThe chief of Denmark\'s intelligence agency warned that China\'s military was using scientific research as an excuse to establish itself in the Arctic, as a great game plays out for control of resources and a sea route in the region. These have become more accessible as ice melts due to climate change. China included the Northern Sea Route in its Belt and Road Initiative in 2017, and does not officially demarcate civilian and military research anywhere. It also calls itself a \'near Arctic\' country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The \'Indian\' Schools of Canada\n\nLike the US and Australia, Canada too is a settler nation. While Eurocentric historians made it out to be a pristine and unclaimed land, the territory that is today Canada and what used to be called British North America was actually inhabited by hundreds of native tribes that were simply called \'Indians\' (the politically correct term today is \'First Nations\'). When the colonies of British North America joined in the Canadian Confederation, the federal government transferred to itself the responsibility of the natives, and thus the Indian Act was passed in 1876, which is still in force albeit with many amendments.\n\nOne of the original goals of the Indian Act was to assimilate the natives into European culture and language at a young age: a process described as "to kill the Indian in the child." As part of this, in 1884, the Act was amended to make it mandatory for native children to be enrolled in a European-style school. However, since the natives were distributed in sparsely-populated territories, this made it effectively mandatory for the children to be sent to federally-run residential schools. Indeed, this was also the official policy of the government, so that the distance between parents and the schools where their children were housed would be too great to visit and thus the children would be \'protected\' from their \'uncivilized\' parents (at the system\'s height, there were fewer than 100 such schools enrolling over 30% of all native children). Moreover, children at these schools were firstly Christianized (most of the schools were run by missionaries paid by the federal government) and secondly forced to speak either English or French - with the threat of severe punishment if they didn\'t comply.\n\nArguably, the colonizers saw these schools as a merciful act, with the goal being to give voting rights to the otherwise disenfranchised natives once they became European in thought and action - or "civilized". However, conditions in the under-funded schools were horrific: beatings, sexual abuse, malnourishment, disease, and physical and mental harassment were an everyday affair. It is known that deaths were common, although records were so poorly kept that an exact and accurate count is impossible. The estimate goes from 3,000-6,000 children that died in the custody of the state, and the traumatic experience has led to an epidemic of alcoholism and mental disorders in Canada\'s native population to this day. A 1906 report stated that the "Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times." The dead children would often be buried in unmarked graves to make them impossible to trace.\n\nIt was only as late as the 1980s - a full century after the system was enacted at the federal level and over 150 years since it was enacted by the pre-Confederation colonies - that acknowledgement of its destructive nature became mainstream. This was led by various churches that acknowledged their own role in the abuse. The federal government reversed its policy and setup a fund to deal with the horrific effects of the system and its survivors. In 2008, Canadian PM Stephen Harper formally apologized in Parliament and established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The TRC\'s 2015 report acknowledged that the natives of Canada were victims of a cultural genocide perpetrated by the government. Since then, the country continues on the path towards reconciliation, with provincial governments, universities, churches, and local groups all working to repair the great loss.\n\nYou can read more about the TRC\'s findings and actions from Canada\'s [National Center for Truth and Reconciliation](https://nctr.ca/map.php).\n\n***Discussion point***: Does India need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to heal the wounds of Islamic and British conquest, or maybe simply acknowledge the atrocities committed? Or will that just open old wounds unnecessarily?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories caught your attention?

I had gotten many reminders to install FASTag before 1st Dec and so I did. Yesterday I set out on a short trip to Jim Corbett(around 300kms for Delhi) and to my surprise, none of the Toll Gate operators knew anything about the TAG I had just installed. I reached home today from my destination and the situation has not changed. I still paid cash at all the tollgates. Even the lanes marked with fastag had no idea about it. Maybe the government(or whosoever is responsible) is not training the operators at the tollgates or the news which was circulated months ago about Dec 1 being the absolute deadline hasn't had any traction. The fastag was promised to make the waiting times shorter, replace cash payments through online payments and reduce emissions as well.

      <li>Title::: 'Farming is not easy as we think it is!'<br />Body: "Disclaimer : This post is personal rant and not targeted towards any one.\n\nI have seen some people over multiple Indian subreddits commenting that farmers don't pay taxes, they get all sort of subsidies, loan waivers etc. Do you all think the farmers of our country are really happy, they are sitting on loads of cash in comfy homes. That's not how it is out there. For example, when the onion prices soar up many of us might be thinking money we spend on 1kg goes to the farmer who cultivated it. Say we pay 80Rs per kg only 25-45 usually go to farmers hands.\nFor earning this 25-45 multiple things have to happen as expected like time of sowing, preventing the crop getting destroyed by animals, pests insects, right price for the crop. There are expenses made towards this prevention by them like buying pesticides, insecticides which have to be effective on the crops. Even after this they always don't get quality pesticides/insecticides due to lack of proper quality control. And above all, the climate should be on their side like raining before/at the time of sowing and not raining during the time of harvest which we are not at all seeing these days. There are enough mediators already who live and earn heavily on the farmers when the crop is harvested.\nFarmers have to be patient all the days from the time of sowing to harvesting and cautious about the crop. We work 6-7 days 9-10 hours per day but they have to be there all the days all the time whenever required irrespective of the day and hour.\nAnother example we get sonamasuri rice(paddy) at a price Rs. 40-55 per kg where as they sell the unpolished raw crop at 1200-1900 per 100 kgs ie; 12-19 Rs per kg. How many of us know that paddy requires 100-120 days for cultivation and require enough water all throughout the duration on the farm. \nThere is also lack of quality control on the seeds sold. We already see enough cotton farmers committing suicide due to non quality seeds.\nHow many of us do truly get outraged at the suicides of farmers, come out and protest.\n\nDuring my school days I used to read that farming is the backbone of India. Clearly the country is losing spine at a rapid rate.\n\n\n\nTLDR; Personal rant about farmers and their problems."<br />Author: 'DrjReddy'  id: 'e4bw1g'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e4bw1g/farming_is_not_easy_as_we_think_it_is/</li>

Network and common society commitment must stay a key methodology to help essential human services.**\n\n* Activism and common society activity have been distinct advantages in the HIV reaction from the good ‘ol days, rousing the worldwide wellbeing network to electrify endeavors for expanded value, regard for wellbeing and human rights, and logical development.\n* In September 2019, worldwide pioneers marked the first-historically speaking UN revelation on UHC with a focal spotlight on essential human services, customized for and worked through enabled and drew in networks.\n* Today, individuals focused consideration, network and common society commitment are remembered for three Sustainable Development Goal targets.\n* World AIDS Day 2019 gives a chance to make an interpretation of our responsibilities without hesitation, to guarantee the job of networks for HIV and wellbeing progress are both celebrated and quickened.\n\n**2. WHO prescribes nations to embrace network based HIV testing, counteractive action, treatment and care as a center technique.**\n\n* WHO prescribes a vital blend of approaches for testing, including network based testing, self-testing and supplier helped referral to contact individuals at most elevated danger of HIV.\n* Nations like South Africa and Rwanda have indicated how prepared friends or network wellbeing laborers have conveyed fast analytic tests with same-day results, empowering more individuals to know their HIV status.\n* WHO suggests expanded quick testing in network settings for key populaces in Europe, Asia and the Americas to supplant difficult methodologies causing a long time of deferrals in test results and treatment commencement.\n* WHO is additionally adding new proposals to assemble network based interpersonal organizations for expanding interest for HIV testing, including self-testing and to advance double HIV/syphilis quick tests and new computerized devices.\n\n**3. Extending the job of networks and network based human services will assist nations with meeting worldwide HIV and UHC targets.**\n\n* Wellbeing administrations are attempting to give all individuals HIV administrations they need. Worldwide quick track focuses for HIV for 2020 are probably not going to be met except if more help gets accessible.\n* The most glaring hole is found in avoidance. In 2018, 1.7 million individuals were recently contaminated with HIV – this number must lessen by three-crease to meet the 2020 objective of 500 000.\n* Testing and treatment inclusion is off track as well – particularly for key populaces and youngsters.

      <li>Title::: 'An open letter response to Prajakta Kuwalekar, the PR expert, who posted an open letter to Utsav asking him to not hurt the #MeToo movement'<br />Body: 'Hi Prajakta,\n\nLet me start this by saying that nobody wants anyone to feel unsafe, and no one wants anyone to be harassed. Anyone who has faced this situation deserves appropriate justice.\n\nHaving said that, there are several complaints from a lot of the current detractors with which the entire movement has unfolded here in India as opposed to the one in US with Harvey Weinstein.\n\nFirst, the movement started with a lot of investigative journalism that fact-checked everything that was unfolding. However, here in India there wasn\'t any sort of fact-checking done by any reporter who simply went ahead and reported the accusations giving them a factual tone. If a person randomly came out said that a person X was a terrorist, you expect the reporters to fact-check that before they report it. The reason is that reporting such accusations have a strong correlation to perception, and if such perception has to come, it has to come from a place of reasonable investigation. Investigation that wasn\'t done here.\n\nSecond, screenshots of accusations were shared anonymously by a lot of people as if to conflate screenshots with reasonable evidence to malign the accused. Screenshots of me anonymously telling someone that person X is a terrorist does mot make him a terrorist.\n\nThird, and the most import one: you keep using the word "victims" instead of the more accurate "accusers". The language indirectly implies guilt on the accused. Any concerns raised against the way accusations were coming out were conflated as "victim-blaming" as if their victimhood was already established, which it wasn\'t.\n\nFourth, there were cries from several "activists", even the "journalists" from the apparently "unbiased news media", to deplatform "harassers" as if their guilt was already established.\n\nFifth, the idea of innocent until proven guilty was relegated to legal channels only, but nevertheless, punitive action was demanded from the authorities overseeing the activities of the accused. Based on "screenshots of \'he-said-she-said\' and no real evidence". Mahesh Bhupati even came out with "guilty until innocent" trope, which again was celebrated by several "activists". As if to suggest that my accusation against a person X on calling them a terrorist warrants any action by anyone when there is no evidence to support my claim.\n\nThe last bit is crucial. Hitchen\'s Razor suggests that assertions claimed without evidence can be diminished without evidence. Which is exactly what would have been followed in the case where someone accused a person X of being a terrorist. However, the same principles were completely disregarded in all the cases of #MeToo where the only evidence was the assertion of the accuser, and nothing else.\n\nAll of this came to head with Utsav exposing this movement, albeit unintentionally, for what it was: a subversion of justice principles, conflation of assertions with facts, accusers with victims, accused with the guilty, and delegitimization of any statements from the accused during the heat of the mud-slinging that took place during that time.\n\nPeople say that there were barely any consequences for the accused. Please tell that to Utsav who was denied a way to make a living for over a year, was humiliated in front of his family, friends, and the general public.\n\nPeople also say that "atleast there was no jail time". Do you really think Mahima, Krupa, Kanika, Agratha will serve any jail time?\n\nLet\'s call Utsav for what he was: a victim of the #MeToo; not a "casualty" as you put it with all the PR training you\'ve got. You keep comparing MJ Akbar and Priya Ramini\'s case with that of Utsav to demonstrate the point. And to that, I implore you: have you learnt nothing about \'reserving judgement until you know more\' based on what happened with Utsav? MJ Akbar may very well be guilty or just as easily an innocent person. All I know is there are some smart people tasked with figuring this out.\n\n\nPeople aren\'t criticizing #MeToo because it gave voice to "victims". They are criticizing it because it legitimized all accusers as victims and all assertions as facts. It wasn\'t just about encouraging reporting to authorities any incidents of misconduct and calling for investigations. This was a literal hunt to call on authorities to take punitive actions based on assertions.\n\nUntil you can admit that what happened was wrong, it would be futile to expect the detractors to listen to you when the blowback from the concerns raised, and subsequently dismissed by several "activists", is finally coming home to roost.'<br />Author: 'thepaleoboy'  id: 'e3vjw8'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e3vjw8/an_open_letter_response_to_prajakta_kuwalekar_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'lost my phone a week back.'<br />Body: 'I lost my iphone a week back (accidentally)  and I went to the police station an hour later to lodge a complaint for the same. it was my first time going to the police station , i was already tensed but the fact that no station officer present at that time in the station was ready to listen to my complaint seriously. I  asked an officer who was sitting at the registration desk  about  the procedure and everything, and he straightforwardly replied that there is no proper mechanism only which can help them in tracking down my phone. I further asked that what is the best that they can do  to help me, to which they said that it will take 4-5 days at least to get any details. \n\nAfter 4 days, I went to the police station to check on any update about my phone. They gave me the number of the investigation officer who is in charge of my case, and asked to inquire him about my phone. Later when i called him, it was surprising for me to know that my IO was in Himachal Pradesh on his vacation and he had no clue about my case. He told me that he will come back in a week, and then only he\'ll get the case under him. \n\nI am not blaming the investigation officer here, even I know that a \'stolen phone\' is not that of a big case that I want to focus upon.  When you look deep down into it, it is not about the phone or the officers , but the very attitude of taking things in a certain manner. " It was just a phone why bother taking this case, whats the point of any investigation" -  that is what leads to this casual behavior in this whole process. How you think that this kind of mind will suddenly change his attitude when a big crime takes place, i dont really understand. And how you think that the person who stole my phone isn\'t capable of creating any trouble. Instead of helping the person who has lodged the complaint, it has turned out to be that the person is doubting as to what was the point of filing it at the first place now!'<br />Author: 'Shambhawii'  id: 'e3spyx'<br />Score:23<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e3spyx/lost_my_phone_a_week_back/</li>

She has not been the level of influencer that some of the others have been, but she still carries a large enough following on Twitter.\n\nDespite having that, she hasn't got as much clout on social media. As per Utsav's twitter thread about her, she has sent unsolicited racy pictures of herself to many other male social media influencers. One can assume that this was her way to buy into this influencer world.\n\nShe is after all, a Digital Marketing Specialist, and everyone knows just riddled with folks of this profession are in the social media influencer sphere, and just how valuable is a network in that sphere crucial to further your career in Digital Marketing.\n\nNetworking is not inherently bad. Sending unsolicited racy pictures of yourself to unsuspecting men is.\n\nAs someone who herself vociferously advocated for removal of people who send unsolicited pictures from their careers, her staying on at Sketchers is, at best, hypocritical. At worst, it puts the male members of her team at risk from being on the receiving end of an unsolicited racy picture from her. \n\nTo go with her sexual harassment story, she has also likely shown to make false allegations against those same men when the said unsolicited picture isn't received well, putting in motion the wheels to destroy the lives of the said men.\n\nBoth of these qualities make her a dangerous co-worker to work with. She can't be trusted to work with male employees, which they likely have. Sketchers needs to cut its losses with her, and either ask her to leave on her own or simply fire her.\n\nUntil she has publicly apologized for the alleged sexual harassment and the very likely false allegations of sexual misconduct, no company should hire her.

      <li>Title::: 'The prince of Dharma who stood up to the atrocities of Madurai Sultanate -- Kampana Udaiyar (Dhanyavaad, Jyotish108 Jee !)'<br />Body: " The prince of Dharma who stood up to the atrocities of   \n \n\n Madurai Sultanate -- Kampana Udaiyar   \n \n\n By Dharmavaan   \n  May 6, 2019   \n \n\n This is the story of a prince -- one of the bravest sons of   \n  Dharma -- who has been written out of the collective   \n  consciousness of the Hindus. I hope you gain something out   \n  of this.   \n \n\n Madurai -- the seat of Hindus in the south. The most   \n  beautiful temple city. A city where Sangam literature   \n  thrived. The sound of tiruppugazh and thiruvasagam   \n  rendering the air in the evenings along the beautiful holy   \n  river Tamaraparani. All this ended when the forces of the   \n  Delhi sultantae invaded Madurai. Malik Kafur the eunuch   \n  servant/general of Khilji invaded Madurai in 1311. The   \n  Meenakshi Amman temple was destroyed. Only one of the   \n  gopurams stood the remaining three demolished. Srirangam   \n  was captured and desecrated. The Madurai sultanate was   \n  established by Jalaluddin. The atrocities began.   \n \n\n Ibn Batuta, a Muslim traveled to Madurai in around 1340 BC.   \n  He speaks thusly of the atrocities of the killed   \n  Ghiyasuddin Dhamagani. Here are his excerpts.   \n \n\n The Hindu prisoners were divided into four sections and   \n  taken to each of the four gates of the great catcar. There,   \n  on the stakes they had carried, the prisoners were impaled.   \n  Afterwards their wives were killed and tied by their hair   \n  to these pales. Little children were massacred on the   \n  bosoms of their mothers and their corpses left there. Then,   \n  the camp was raised, and they started cutting down the   \n  trees of another forest. In the same manner did they treat   \n  their later Hindu prisoners. This is shameful conduct such   \n  as I have not known any other sovereign guilty of. It is   \n  for this that God hastened the death of Ghiyath-eddin.   \n \n\n One day whilst the Kadhi (Kazi) and I were having our food   \n  with (Ghiyazu-d-din), the Kazi to his right and I to his   \n  left, an infidel was brought before him accompanied by his   \n  wife and son aged seven years. The Sultan made a sign with   \n  his hand to the executioners to cut off the head of this   \n  man ; then he said to them in Arabic : 'and the son and the   \n  wife.' They cut off their heads and I turned my eyes away.   \n  When I looked again, I saw their heads lying on the ground.   \n \n\n I was another time with the Sultan Ghiyath-eddin when a   \n  Hindu was brought into his presence. He uttered words I did   \n  not understand, and immediately several of his followers   \n  drew their daggers. I rose hurriedly, and he said to me ; '   \n  Where are you going ' ? I replied : ' I am going to say my   \n  afternoon (4 o'clock) prayers. ' He understood my reason,   \n  smiled, and ordered the hands and feet of the idolater to   \n  be cut off. On my return I found the unfortunate swimming   \n  in his blood.   \n \n\n Most of us cannot even comprehend this evil. A more   \n  depraved bunch we could not envision. At that point most   \n  Hindus had lost hope. But as always, on the side of Dharma   \n  a warrior arose. The son of Emperor Bukka of Vijayanagara -   \n  \\- Kumara Kampana Udaiyar. The warrior who would stand up   \n  nay charge against this incredible evil. The warrior who   \n  would risk it all to put an end to this evil and restore   \n  Dharma.   \n \n\n His exploits are chronicled in Madura Vijayam an epic poem.   \n  Legend says that he was visited by an old woman when he was   \n  in Kanchipuram. She implored him to liberate South India   \n  from the sultanate. More importantly, she asked him   \n  liberate the Meenakshi Amman temple and restore its   \n  sanctity. The prince decided. He would stand up to the   \n  barbarians. He would rescue Madurai. He would personally   \n  battle this evil.   \n \n\n This meant going to war against the barbarians and in   \n  modern day terms a group more psychotic than IS. Bukka and   \n  Kampana knew well what would happen to the prince in the   \n  event of a defeat. But prince Kampana in modern parlance   \n  was a badass -- a legendary one at that backed by Dharma.   \n  Legend (and we Hindus for sure dismiss it as myth) says   \n  that the prince received a sword from the goddess   \n  Gangadevi.   \n \n\n Kampana began the battle. Troops of the Sultan fell in   \n  scores and finally the sultan himself arrived to fight. In   \n  an epic combat, Kampana destroyed the banner of the sultan,   \n  then the bowstring of the sultan. Finally, he beheaded the   \n  sultan. This is recounted in Madura Vijayam   \n \n\n The sultan incandescent with ire flung his bow and seized a   \n  fearsome sword.   \n \n\n King Kampa in turn took hold of his sword sent to him by   \n  Agastya to vanquish the king, a blade dreadful as the dark   \n  lord of death.   \n \n\n Kampa riding at a great gallop lpped off the sultan's head   \n  with his sword. The head of the sultan that had bowed to   \n  none now lay on the ground.   \n \n\n A fitting end for the evil tyrants. Kampa and the other   \n  vijayanagara Kings then restored the Srirangam temple and   \n  finally gained possession of Madurai.   \n \n\n Remember this dear Hindus -- Whenever evil tries to eclipse   \n  Dharma, whenever we feel all hope is lost there will emerge   \n  a warrior of Dharma. A warrior so brave that the forces of   \n  evil, however terrible they may be, crumble in his path.   \n  Such a warrior was Kampana. Again, dear Hindus, I ask you   \n  to take a moment to bow to this son of Dharma in reverence,   \n  in prayer, and most importantly in gratitude. This prince   \n  who stood up to an unparalleled force of evil. This prince   \n  who spent his life battling for the adherents of Dharma   \n  whose descendants (though 1 billion in number) chose to   \n  throw him out of their collective conscious."<br />Author: 'fanabba'  id: 'e2yf4f'<br />Score:63<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e2yf4f/the_prince_of_dharma_who_stood_up_to_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A case for why Cleartrip.com needs to fire Kanika Kaul (Cleartrip/Nestaway) of the Utsav saga until she has shown reasonable contrition and remorse'<br />Body: 'Kanika Kaul (@KanikaKaul22), of the Utsav saga, has been active on the social media influencer sphere for quite sometime. A lot of the clout that she gained, she gained through contributions made on opinions by a lot of the other social media influencers in Mumbai at the time. She eventually managed to make her way in and started getting followers of her own.\n\nNow, Kanika Kaul isn\'t just a graphic designer. Earlier in her career, she has also made a series of art works that have been published in the media that furthered the cause of feminism. Being published on Buzzfeed and other popular journals helped her build her clout and network. Network that she used to get a job in first Nestaway, and then Cleartrip.com\n\nThe Cleartrip.com bit is interesting, and the timing is particularly telling. Kanika Kaul was vocally and vociferously active on Twitter during the whole time when #MeToo was running wild. She shared accounts of her stories anonymously, but participated in the bashing of the said person publicly. Her opinions were shared by many popular journalists that helped her expand her reach even further. And one month after gaining a lot of clout on social media via her coverage of #MeToo, she used her enhanced network to get another job.\n\nAt the face of evidence contrary to the narrative that she started anonymously and then drove publicly, she essentially came out with her response that was empty, and devoid of any proof. Her claims for why her narrative is now looking shaky was that she simply forgot. The best case she has right now is a claim that has no evidence.\n\nHitchens razor suggests that assertions claimed without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. In this case, Utsav even has evidence to show that there is a high possibility that she was lying. Combine that with the clout she got during the whole #MeToo saga, and the timing of her joining her new job can strongly correlate to false assertions made to get the said job through the network.\n\nEvery graphic designer knows just how hard it is to get a breakthrough in your career that pays well. She got hers by mingling with the social media influencers, and now what is strongly looking like an opportunistic capitalization on the #MeToo movement with lies spread to further the narrative just starting out with the bashing of Utsav.\n\nAs is true with all professions, Cleartrip likely employs men. How are the men supposed to feel safe working next to a co-worker who likely has a history of lying about sexual misconduct to drive a narrative that furthers her career? How is any man going to feel safe that she "forgot" about an interaction that could be crucial later to classify something as consensual vs. predatory? How is the public supposed to feel when Cleartrip is going to continue to employ a person who can be cavalier about dangerous consequences to other people simply because she wants to advance her career?\n\nWith all these factors in mind, Cleartrip needs to introspect if they really need to associate with such a dangerous person right now and if the cost of keeping her worth the trouble. At this point, it is not worth the trouble and it should either ask her to resign or simply let her go. Until she has shown remorse for her actions of destroying a person\'s life because of her own forgetful memory, she shouldn\'t be employed by any outlet. There are quite a few handful individuals who haven\'t partaken in the wrongful destruction of another person to further their career who would jump at the opportunity to work for these outlets. It is time for Kanika Kaul to introspect, and not "forget" that her actions have consequences.'<br />Author: 'thepaleoboy'  id: 'e2whe1'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e2whe1/a_case_for_why_cleartripcom_needs_to_fire_kanika/</li>

I don't know if either or both of them are planning to delete their accounts, in which case it would be even harder to deal with, but as not a lot of information is available, I'm taking things worst-case.\n\nThese two gentlemen, along with the other awesome mods, have been the linchpins of the sub. They've given a lot of time, I mean lot of valuable personal time, to this job which is at its best completely thankless, to keep the sub neat and worth visiting. Who does this? Even if you pay, who'd contribute personal time to social media? Nobody. It's just a desire to do good that drove them. That's all. There are other social media channels where people get paid to do stuff, but this is not one of those. It's obvious that both are self-motivated individuals.\n\nBoth have cited paucity of time as the principal reason. Doing this for such a long time is an achievement in itself. I often see them doing sub stuff at odd hours. It's a tough job. Seeing this, my respect for both of them increases manifold. \n\nI believe that we need to let them go with a smile and a hand shake, given that they've accomplished their job. At the same time, we need to welcome the incumbent mods, who'll be as eager and as dispensed to hard work as these two people, whose shoes they'll fill in. I understand that the process of finding new people is already underway, and that alleviates my anxiety to certain extent.\n\nThese two gentlemen have our highest regard. Had it been the real world, we'd have given them a solid farewell. But, this is a virtual world, and we'll have to live with its limitations. We wish them all the best.\n\nI personally request drm_wvr and kalmuah to only quit moderating, not to quit visiting the sub or reddit in toto, or hell, deleting account.

      <li>Title::: '[Unpopular Opinion] The randirona about the Kanpur metro post is absolutely hilarious'<br />Body: 'This is the height of hypocrisy. I\'ll ignore Critical_finance because he\'s a delusional bipolar chutiya, but RajaRajaC, Annon4Comment, and some of the other guys are just effing hilarious with their USSI-tier concern trolling and desire to arm twist BJP for solely their pranth\'s gain. On the inside, I feel most of it is soft bigotry towards those from the so-called "bhaiya" states or some kind of desire to project oneself to that of their "unproductive dehati" countrymen, but I\'ll go through some of these ridiculous claims:\n\n&gt;[+7] A metro in the south overall adds more value to the nation than one in fucking Kanpur or Indore or Bhopal...It\'s crazy that the south gets called parochial while the Northern Politicians are so petty they\'d make an entire region starve.\n\nIn most cities in the "bhaiya" states, among educated families, whether you\'re from Kanpur, Bhopal, Patna, Banaras, Agra, and the likes, your options for work in the tech fields are sadly very limited. There is a small tech park in Indore (where I am), but apart from that, what other city in the North save for Jaipur or Noida is there for them to go? If they get a job in Bangalore, Mumbai, or Pune, they have to go through the locals\' issues of having to fit in with the local culture, learning a new language (which they have probably never been exposed to). \n\nWith all this in mind, who has been starved? Sure, blame those Mulayams, Lalus, and Diggies for this, but now we have to make up for it. You guys might hate our guts and don\'t want us in your cities, so "subsidising" the North is the only way us "dehati gawars" won\'t migrate and flood your cities. Educated and qualified people from the North deserve and have the right to work in the same large firms as anyone else. It\'s already a huge thing to have to work far away from home and face being sidelined or discriminated. The divide boils down to urban and rural and it\'s imperative that larger urban centres in the North prop up and attract investment and create jobs. \n\n&gt;[+9, in response to the previous quote] For sure. Just look at the way he delayed Chennai’s phase II and is delaying Kochi’s phase II. The centre also delayed Kochi’s water metro project until this year, when original plans wanted it to begin operations by now.\n\nBoth Kochi and Chennai\'s delays are because of land acquisition and soil issues. Delays occurred in the construction of Delhi\'s, Bhopal\'s, Agra\'s and Indore\'s metros, yet no one was doing randirona about that. Oh, but apparently Northern cities getting a metro isn\'t important as they are meant to just remain villagers who spit paan and gutka while we first world Norwegian-tier Dravidians look down on you sub-Saharan Northie rapists.  \n\n&gt;The nations’s industrial base is in the South, through AP, KN and TN, but the Dedicated Freight corridors are in the North. Train 18 is now a tourist train running a hindu pilgrimage route instead of intercity between densely populated areas like Chennai-Bengaluru.\n\nAnd to that, I say that the industrial base should be diversified to the North to bring developmental parity and end this one-way migratory stream that is bringing regional divisions in my country. My brothers in UP and Bihar should not have to suffer on this account. It\'s time to make Kanpur, Bhopal, or Patna equal to that of Bangalore, Coimbatore, or Chennai. Some Punekars might argue for the son-of-soil theory as they hate Hindi bhashis, so let\'s fix that. They should get to be the sole sons of soil as we do (I don\'t subscribe to this as it\'s against the Constitution, but it shows how it pleases them too).\n\nIf all that is socialist, so be it. Our RajaRajaC openly claims to be one yet he seems to be spewing the same rhetoric as those in DMK (and I hear he voted for them) and wants the centre to give the same attention to the already developed areas of our country as the sub-Saharan level poor areas.\n\n&gt;Kanpur gives Mudiji votes. Coimbatore, Chennai, Vizag (all Economic power houses with the density needed for a metro) don\'t.\n\n&gt;Very well put. This is why I hope Modi fails miserably in 2024 to win a single majority and needs the AIADMK / DMK and TRS to prop him up. Only then will shit get done here.\n\nThis is funny and illogical. Assuming humans are rational beings who will choose what benefits them (which is far from the truth btw), why the hell should UP, MP, Bihar, not firmly support Modi, if, as you claim RajaRajaC, that they are given the most attention by the centre? You want them to vote against their interests just so the South gets a higher say in hypothetical a bare-majority NDA government. This just defies logic..\n\n&gt;Kanpur gives Mudiji votes. Coimbatore, Chennai, Vizag (all Economic power houses with the density needed for a metro) don\'t.\n\nReally? I am pretty sure Kanpur, Chennai, and Vizag all contribute exactly ONE Lok Sabha MP seat. Also, this statement comes with the tall assumption that people will always vote in their best economic interests - suitable in theory, not in electoral politics where the praja votes on jati, dharm, fandom, and various other factors. Given that star worship is a motif in Southern politics, it\'s nothing that can be just ignored.'<br />Author: 'KingfisherPlayboy'  id: 'e23vkk'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e23vkk/unpopular_opinion_the_randirona_about_the_kanpur/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'If the regions of modern day Pakistan were still Buddhist, would they still be separate and hostile towards Indians?'<br />Body: "For those who don't know, Northwest parts of South Asia were predominantly Buddhist before the age of Islam. From the Mauryans to Kabul Shahis, Buddhism flourished in this region for over a Millenia. Places like Bamyan used to be like Mecca for Buddhists and it is believed that Buddhism spread to China through this region, instead of directly from India. \n\n**Coming back to question, my answer would be yes.** Assuming that Islam didn't happen and the people who live in Af-Pak are predominantly Buddhist, I think they will still consider themselves to be distinct from people who live inside modern day India, and therefore would want their own separate country. Below are my reasons:\n\n1) **People who live in Af-Pak regions are just different in their psyche** \\- For a start, they don't have a pluralistic tradition like in India. When Buddhism became popular, they quickly and almost universally converted, and did the same again with Islam. This is different to Indian regions where, Hinduism flourished side-by-side with other religions. Even pre-Vedic religious traditions like Animism and Goddess worship are very much alive in India.\n\n2) **Geography, not religion, is destiny** \\- I think one major reason why Umayyad Caliphate spread so fast in Af-Pak is because of the desert terrain. Desert people understand desert people better. It's also the reason why the spread stopped when it reached the Monsoon climate of India. This goes back to point No. 1; Pakistanis are destined to feel non-Indian or even anti-Indian because of where they are on the map.\n\n3) **Look at Myanmar or Sri Lanka** \\- Both were under British occupation but chose to be a separate country. Why shouldn't the same happen with Pakistan? Maybe the hostility would be less because the religious traditions are similar, but if there are contentious borders like in Kashmir, then there will be conflicts. \n\n**What are your thoughts on this?**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'e1yuku'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e1yuku/if_the_regions_of_modern_day_pakistan_were_still/</li>

I will post TL;dr about the situation regardless.\n\n- No party has the majority\n\n- BJP fails to maintain the government\n\n- Shivsena isn't able to form a goverment\n\n- Presidents rule is applied\n\n- Shivsena + NCP + Congress prepares to form the government on Saturday afternoon\n\n- BJP + Ajit Pawar of NCP forms the government secretly at 5AM in the morning of the Saturday.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe government is allowed to be formed by the Governor because Ajit Pawar produced a letter of support with signatures of all the MLA's of NCP. Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.\n\nThe reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.\n```"<br />Author: 'WagwanKenobi'  id: 'e1bzke'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e1bzke/mh_elections_alleged_insider_info_copied_from/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'SBI Records Hidden Numbers On Electoral Bonds – Govt Misled Public'<br />Body: ' \n\nAll  electoral bonds can be tracked by the government due to the unique,  hidden, alphanumeric codes they are marked with, that are visible only  under ultraviolet (UV) light – that’s the story **The Quint** [exposed](https://www.thequint.com/news/politics/hidden-number-on-election-electoral-bond) back in April 2018.\n\nIn response to **The Quint\'s** article, the Finance Ministry had misled the public in its [press release](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=178726)  later that month, saying, “This number is not noted by the SBI in any  record associated with buyer or political party depositing a particular  electoral bond”.   \n\n&gt;But  documents now show that the hidden alphanumeric codes are recorded by  the State Bank of India (SBI), the same bank that issues the electoral  bonds.  \n\n\nThe  SBI documents received through RTI reveal that it was the Finance  Ministry that actually allowed the bank to record the hidden  alphanumeric codes and asked it "to keep information highly confidential  to prevent its leaking in any way".    \n\nBJP  Minister and party treasurer Piyush Goyal, in his press conference on  21 November 2019, said that the serial number is put on the bond with an  “invisible ink” so that there is no harassment of the donor. Again, he  did not mention that the hidden code *is* recorded by the SBI.\n\nThe question is:\n\n* **Why did the Finance Ministry mislead the media?**\n* **Could  it be that the government didn\'t want it revealed that they were keen  to track all political donations via the hidden numbers? And at the same  time, didn\'t want to reveal the ruling party’s donors to the public?**\n* **Why  didn\'t Piyush Goyal tell the media in its press conference that the  hidden alphanumeric codes are recorded? And who would harass political  donors to warrant such secrecy?**\n\n## SBI Objected to Issuance Of Electoral Bonds Without Serial Numbers\n\nThe  SBI had objected to the issuance of electoral bonds without a “serial  number” on it, reveal RTI documents filed by the transparency activist  Anjali Bhardawaj.\n\nTaking note of the SBI\'s demand, the government  had agreed to place a unique serial number on the electoral bonds. But  the challenge before the government was that if a visible serial number  is placed on the bonds like on any other promissory note, then the  objective of keeping the donors of electoral bonds anonymous would have  been defeated.\n\nThe donors would have started doubting the  anonymity of the bonds carrying a visible serial number, because it  would become easy to track the bonds’ donors and donees.\n\nHence,  the government tactfully decided to embed a ‘hidden’ unique alphnumeric  code in the bonds, which is visible only under ultra-violet light and  didn’t make that fact public while notifying the electoral bonds in  January 2018.\n\nThe RTI documents further reveal that the SBI demanded these serial numbers on three grounds:\n\n* “Without serial number on the electoral bonds, there will be no audit trail available for internal control and reconciliation.”\n* “Branch  cannot identify the genuineness of the electoral bonds. Any number of  forged electoral bonds can be paid if the serial number is not captured  in the system.”\n* “In case forged electoral bonds are paid and Law  Enforcement Agencies or a Competent Court ask for details in this  regard…the Bank will not be able to provide any details about to whom it  was issued and in which account it was encashed.”\n\nThe SBI  clarified to the Department of Economic Affairs of Finance Ministry in  its letter dated 19 January 2018 that it is not possible for the bank to  issue electoral bonds without a serial number.\n\n## The SBI Never Asked for ‘Hidden’ Number As Security Feature\n\nThe RTI documents also reveal that the SBI specified the security features that the bank would want on the electoral bonds.\n\nThe SBI requested five security features:\n\n* Watermarked Security Paper\n* Fugitive ink\n* Pantograph\n* Hologram on Bonds of Rs 1 lakh\n* Micro Lettering\n\nThe electoral bonds were printed in the Indian Security Press in Nashik.\n\nThe  Minutes of the Meeting on proposed security features to be incorporated  in the electoral bonds obtained under the RTI reveals that an  “invisible fluorescent ink” – which fluoresces under UV light – was used  to print the numbers.\n\nClick here to access documents, [page 1, ](https://www.scribd.com/document/436569732/Screenshot-2019-11-24-at-10-01-52-AM)[page 2](https://www.scribd.com/document/436569754/SBI-document-received-under-RTI), [page 3](https://www.scribd.com/document/436569763/SBI-document-received-under-RTI), [page 4](https://www.scribd.com/document/436569777/SBI-document-received-under-RTI) and [page 5.](https://www.scribd.com/document/436569785/Finance-Ministry-document-received-under-RTI)'<br />Author: 'iali307'  id: 'e0xdqg'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e0xdqg/sbi_records_hidden_numbers_on_electoral_bonds/</li>

This will complete the initial order of 40 aircraft, 16 IOC-spec (Initial Operational Clearance), 16 FOC and 8 trainers.\n* Between end-2021 and mid-2023, no production is planned (which is why HAL is pushing for export sales).\n* **Tejas Mk1a** \\- an improved version of the Tejas Mk1, the Mk1a will come with AESA radar, air-to-air refuelling, new electronic countermeasures suite, avionics upgrade. The long delayed contract for 83 Mk1a has not yet been signed, but should be done by December of January. From contract signing till first test aircraft to delivery will be minimum 3 years (as said by HAL, can be longer) and at 16/year deliveries will continue till 2028.\n* **Tejas Mk2 or as it is more popularly called MWF (medium weight fighter)** \\- it is heavier, longer and equipped with more powerful engines than the Mk1 (GE F414). It will look different too since it has canards. The design was shown at Aero India 2019 and MWF is expected to replace Jaguars, Mirages. Same as Tejas, being developed by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), IAF wants over 200 these. First flight is tentatively on 2023, will not go into production before 2025 and deliveries will stretch into 2030s. Could be built by the private sector, but not much is known about it since there is no official contract.\n* **Twin-Engine Deck Based Fighter (TEDBF)** \\- This is a new one since the Indian navy has rejected (and has been rejecting LCA for years). They want an Indian developed twin-engined carrier-based aircraft probably using the MWF as a template. This is because IN's demand for 57 new carrier-based fighters is going nowhere and frankly India and the Navy dont have $10 billion to blow on planes. ADA has said that this will have its first flight by 2026. The program apparently got the go-ahead recently.\n* **AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft)** \\- the contracts to build the prototypes should be signed soon and expect the first flight to be by 2025, production start by 2030. Refer to this post for all updates on this project. \n\nThis leaves some gaps like a twin-engined IAF jet. Which is where the MMRCA2.0 contract comes in, with probably a future order for India-made Rafales or Indian-made Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'e0wu0t'<br />Score:64<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e0wu0t/indian_fighter_programs_currently_underway/</li>

Whoever rules Delhi, rules the entire Indian Subcontinent and whichever region that rebels against Delhi, will get the Pakistani or Kashmiri treatment. \n\nHaving said that, it seems like the warlords of Maharashtra had notable successes in destabilizing Delhi over the centuries. The famous one is the Maratha rebellion against the Mughals. During the British occupation, there were 3 Anglo-Maratha wars and since Independence, whichever govt at center has had a problem in getting unquestionable loyalty from local leaders of Maharashtra. \n\nI think all these events are very much correlated. The latest fallout between BJP and Shiv Sena is just a continuation of centuries old problem and having NCP as coalition is going to be politically more unstable.\n\nMaharashtra poses a unique problem to whoever rules Delhi; They can't *ignore and just rule* like they do with other regions. Take Tamil Nadu for example. It's also rich and reasonably developed, but Tamilians made the state so exclusive to rest of India that it has little influence outside the state.

Consider the material body (a man made up of five elements) as a television. There are channels in it.\n\nTrikuti Kamal (lotus) has two petals (of black and white colour). Consider it an airport, an aerodrome. Wherever one has to go from there, that very aeroplane will be available there. Because all saints proceed from here only to their further paths. There, God (God, whom the devotee worships) comes in the form of the guru (Shabd swaroopi Guru or call him Shabd Guru), and takes His hans (devout soul) along with Him to His personal place (lok). Nijman (ParBrahm) (the real mind, Purna Brahm) lives here. He does not let any kind of deceit happen with the living being. Like, before going to the airport, passport, whichever country one has to go to, that country’s visa and ticket are obtained in advance. On reaching there, immediately one is made to sit in that very aeroplane. Whichever God’s lok one has done preparations to go to, by doing sumiran of naam after making a guru, from trikuti he goes to the same lok with his Shabd Guru. Beyond this lies Sahansrar kamal and Jyoti (light) is visible there. The worshippers of Brahm, on seeing this light, consider it to be their good fortune. Information only upto this is the experience of Rishi Patanjali Yog Darshan, and other yogis. There is no knowledge beyond this in any of the established scriptures. This is Kaal’s first web.\n\nThose devout souls who have found a Complete Satguru, they have taken Satnaam after listening to the spiritual discourse (satsang). They have understood this Kaal’s web and have started reciting naam.\n\nKaal’s second web is that he has faked {has made a duplicate copy of} all these creations of Purna Brahm: Satlok, Alakh lok, Agam lok, and Anami lok. He has made fake shabds. There is a way to hear them. After closing eyes, ears, and mouth with fingers of hands, then concentrate on ears. There is an insect, jhanga, which produces a jheen-jheen sound. A similar sound is heard. It is known as Anhad jheenga shabd; hear this.\n\nSecond way of worship – press the eyeballs (under the eyelids) of both the eyes. Various kinds of lights (fireworks) will be seen in them.\n\nThen has described the third sadhna – collect the cold breath, moon (breath from left nostril), and sun (soor), warm breath (breath from right nostril) and enter sushmna. This is a method of doing breathing-exercise (Pranayam). Then go ahead to trivaini. All these are created by Kaal. When worshippers go to trivaini, there are three paths there. On the right-hand side, there is a lotus (kamal) with sahansrar (one-thousand) petals. That is Kaal’s (Jyoti Niranjan’s) Mahaswarg (Great-Heaven). One will hear sounds of a bell and conch shell there, and then sparkling lights will be seen. There, the doer (Kaal) lives in an unmanifested form; this is what the devotees believe, but in reality, he is in form in the form of Mahabrahma, Mahavishnu, and Mahashiv. On the right-hand side, there have been twelve bhakts of Kaal (Brahm). They live there in peace. They have no fear of death until the great destruction (Mahapralay). But they will die in the Mahapralay. When Kaal will again create nature, then they will go in the 84-lakh births to bear the hardships of karm (actions). When this worshipper moves towards Brahmrandra, then a whole army of Yam doots (messengers of Yam, the God of death) and demonesses of terribly horrifying images is present there. That army of Kaal can neither be conquered by ‘Om’ naam, nor by Kiliyam’, nor by Hariyam', nor by SohM, nor by Jyoti Niranjan-Rarankar-Omkaar-SohM-Shakti (Shriyam'), nor by Radhaswami, nor by Akaal moort-Shabd Swaroopi Ram or SatPurush, or by any other arbitrary naams. This is only possible after obtaining updesh from a Complete Saint, and on doing sumiran of Satnaam, Sachcha naam (Om-SohM) through breath, which strikes them like arrows. Consequently, they run away. The path becomes clear; Brahmrandra opens up, and the worshipper, on seeing the actual form of Kaal (where he lives in a Viraat form), stepping over his head enters the eleventh gate [which Kaal has kept shut by his head. By the influence of Satguru’s Satyanaam and Saarnaam, Kaal’s head itself bends down and that door opens up. Thus, this hans enters the ParBrahm’s lok]. There is no influence of Kaal’s Maya there. After that sumiran of only ‘SohM’ shabd and Saarnaam starts automatically. Om’s jaap is not uttered. Because the subtle body (sukshm shareer) is left behind i.e. the earnings of ‘Om’ mantra are left with Brahm (Kaal). Kaaran and Mahakaaran also finish with the sumiran of Saarnaam (which starts only by surat-nirat). At that time, only ‘Kaivalya’ shareer (body) is left. At that time, a living being’s state is similar to the light of 10 suns; he becomes this much effulgent. Satguru asks there, “Oh Hans soul! Have you got any attachment to any living being, thing, or wealth? If yes, then you will have to return to Kaal lok.” But at that time, this embodied soul has crossed the whole web of Kaal. The soul does not agree to return. Then he says, “No Satguru Ji, now I will not go to that hell.” Then, Satguru gives bath to that hans (soul) in nectar Maansarover. At that time, that hans’s (soul’s) kaivalya shareer and all other covers end, and the soul appears in aatm-tattav (self-element). This Maansarover is present in the vacuum place between ParBrahm’s lok and Satlok from where the Bhanvar gufa (cave) commences. At that time, the appearance of this soul becomes as effulgent as sixteen suns, and after crossing the twelfth gate and entering Satlok, enjoys the bliss of Purna Brahm forever. This is complete liberation/salvation.\n\nThis soul, even by mistake, does not ever return to Kaal’s web. Like, if a child’s hand gets burnt in fire, then he never goes near fire. He does not even try to touch it.\n\nIn no. 14, Sahib Kabir is telling that this world is hanging upside down. Like, a well is filled with nectar; likewise, the Supreme God’s bliss is present in this body. It is beyond the tenth gate, which is the sushmna gate in this body with an opening below. He who passes through sushmna, only that devotee enjoys the benefit. This sadhna is formed by acquiring a Guru and naam.\n\nIn no. 15, Satguru Kabir Sahib Ji is disclosing the secret that when a worshipper of Kaal does jaap of ‘Om’ naam considering God as Nirgun (without material qualities) after acquiring a guru, then Kaal himself comes in the form (fake shabd-like form) of that worshipper’s guru and takes him to Mahaswarg (MahaIndra lok/Great heaven). When they approach the Mahaindra lok, then a horrifying sound like a violent thunder of clouds occurs. A worshipper who becomes frightened, returns to the 84-lakh births, and he, who does not become frightened, moves ahead with his guru. He then hears a pleasant drum playing there. There is one more red-coloured, four-petalled lotus in Mahaswarg from which ‘Omkaar’ sound is being produced.\n\nThe meaning of no. 16 is that he is a saint, who opens the lock put by Kaal on the tenth gate with the key of Satnaam, and also opening the eleventh gate ahead, which Kaal has kept shut after creating the fake Satlok etc in the twenty-first brahmand beyond the twenty brahmands, enters the ParBrahm’s (Akshar Brahm) lok. Because nine gates (two nostrils, two ears, two eyes, mouth, anus, genital opening – these nine) are visible. There is a lock on the tenth gate (which comes after sushmna opens), and the eleventh gate has been built at the entrance of ParBrahm’s lok where God Kaal himself is sitting in physical form.\n\nNo. 17 – there is white vacuum place ahead (which Kaal God has faked). There he has created a fake Maansarover, and those, who are nirgun worshippers of Brahm, after giving bath to them in this sarover (lake), he sends them to fake ParBrahm’s lok which he has created in Mahaswarg. They disappear from the divine vision of other worshippers. They are considered to be Brahm-leen (to have vanished in Brahm). Kaal has kept this place a secret. Those who reach here, they become delighted on meeting hans (souls) who reached there earlier. Like, on meeting pitr-pitras (deceased ancestors), and meeting ghosts. In this, Rarankar sound is playing. These worshippers who worshipped with Rarankar jaap by acquiring Khaichri mudra (posture), they go to Mahaswarg of Mahavishnu (Brahm-Kaal). Then there is Mahasunn (great vacuum place), created by Kaal; the hans (souls) who do not have gurus can not cross this. There, Kaal has set free mayavi (illusory, having supernatural or magical powers) lions, tigers, and snakes. They bite the souls who do not have a guru. Therefore, whether you do bhakti of Kaal lok or Satlok, it is necessary to make a guru. This is an easy and blissful extension.\n\nThese lotuses, which are being mentioned, are of the subtle body, and the subtle body has also been put on a living being by Kaal. Therefore, Satguru is giving the description of all this fake creations of Kaal. There is one more eight-petalled lotus; it is said to be ParBrahm’s lok. In reality, this is that place where Purna Brahm lives in another form, and neither can Brahm (Kaal) go there, nor the three gods. Therefore, he is also known as ParBrahm. In its right part, live twelve bhakts. On its left, is a ten-petalled lotus in which the karm-sanyasi (one, who has renounced the world and lives on alms) -nirgun worshippers live. Like these, Kaal has created five Brahms (gods), and five ands (elliptical spheres). He has by himself given them the title of NiHakshar, and has kept four places in concealment. Those devotees who are worshippers of Satguru Kabir Sahib and again start doing Kaal bhakti, Kaal (Brahm-Niranjan) becomes so much annoyed with them that he keeps them as prisoners in these secret places, and torments them a lot there. There are two mountains ahead, and through them is a way; Kaal keeps his worshippers, who are at the post of a guru, in this place for some time. This is also known as Bhanwar gufa (bhanwar cave). There, these hans (gurus) enjoy themselves. The sound of ‘SohM’ shabd is itself playing there, and melodious sound of a flute is also playing. Diamonds and emeralds are studded in that place. A very charming place has been created. After crossing the lok of Akshar Purush (ParBrahm) by doing jaap of this SohM mantra, comes the fake Satlok. There, Kaal himself is deceiving by acquiring ParBrahm’s appearance. A fragrance keeps arising there continuously. This is a very extensive place. Only special Kaal-worshippers (like Markande rishi) are able to reach here. Here, Kaal himself is sitting as SatPurush, but remains hidden. A sound is automatically occurring there. The souls who reach there respectfully move chanvar (whisk) over that fake SatPurush sitting in Mahavishnu form, and become delighted. The appearance of that Kaal-like SatPurush has been made somewhat similar to SatPurush, having the brightness of thousand suns and moons.\n\nThen he himself has become Alakh Purush, and has built an Alakh lok. Then, becoming Agam Purush in Agam lok, and Anami Purush in Akah lok, himself is deceiving everyone, and says that it is indescribable. Only he will know this, who will reach there.\n\nIn the end of the shabd (hymn), Kabir Sahib says, “I have presented before you a distinct description of all these lotuses of the material body and the immaterial (subtle) body. I have disclosed the secret of creation to you. This (is inside both the bodies – material and immaterial) is inside the body. This Kaal’s Maya (Prakriti) has cunningly done fake creation similar to that of Satlok in And (brahmand).” Even then, there is a difference of day and night in this and the actual Satlok. Like, there is no visible difference between fine salt and caster sugar, but they have different tastes. Kabir Sahib states that our path is like that of a bird (vihangam). Like, a bird flies from the ground and straight away reaches the top of the tree. The path of the worshippers of Kaal is that of an ant. Like, an ant moves from the ground to the tree’s trunk, and then via bigger and smaller branches reaches the top. Kabir Sahib’s hans (souls) sit in an aircraft in trikuti and fly from there. But the worshippers of Brahm (Kaal) move like an ant and go to their respective deity’s place. A worshipper can go to Satlok only by an aircraft of Saarnaam, and can not go by any other way of worship or mantra. Like, a sea can only be crossed by a ship or an aeroplane; not by swimming. Therefore, worshippable Kabir Sahib Ji has said, “I and my hans (devout souls) go to Satlok on the basis of shabd (Satyanaam and Saarnaam). There, the brightness of the body of a soul becomes equivalent to the brightness of sixteen suns. There, the soul acquires a human-like but eternal body. There it is not called a living being. There, after becoming equipped with the qualities similar to that of God, it is called Hans, and in the upper two loks – Alakh lok and Agam lok, it is known as Paramhans. In Anami lok, the existence of God and the soul does not remain distinct. On the basis of Tattavgyan (true spiritual knowledge), worshippers do not get entangled in lotuses. Because Satguru Ji gives the Saarshabd-like key with which all the locks (bondages) of Kaal automatically keep opening, and sound of the true shabd starts playing, which is occurring outside this body in Satlok. Our Satlok is beyond Pind (body) and And (brahmand). After going there, the soul attains complete salvation.”"<br />Author: '77369'  id: 'e04kox'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e04kox/kabir_sahib/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Dispelling the absolute bogus narrative surrounding NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill...'<br />Body: 'So there has been a huge uproar surrounding the NRC and the CAB, with the main allegation being that it is religious discrimination. This post is to counter and quash that false narrative.\n\n\nLet me start by stating one thing : **"Partition of India was a BOTCHED and INCOMPLETE job"**\n\n\nRead that line again, and embed it in your mind.\n\n\nPartition happened mainly for two reasons :~\n\n\n1. To create a separate nation for Muslims,\n\n\n2. To give a free-hand to Muslim *Zamindars* in the newly cutout nation (India, after partition, immediately ended the atrocious *Zamindari* System, while Pakistan still indulges in this system).\n\n\nKeep in mind that India was for all religions - *including* the Muslims who wanted to stay here, while Pakistan was carved to create a nation officially based on one religion, hence, coexistence of all religions was never a goal for Pakistan\'s founders. The result was the persecution of all the minorities in West &amp; East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), on an almost genocidal scale.\n\n\nA direct result of this persecution was the 1971 War, due to which Bangladesh was formed (a secular nation like India). At that time, millions of Bangladeshi Hindus fled to India to save themselves from the Pakistani Army. Keep this fact in mind too.\n\n\nNow, what remained after the formation of Bangladesh? West Pakistan, that is, the current Pakistan. Nothing worthwhile was done here. Persecution of minorities is still happening in (West) Pakistan, and this is a DIRECT RESULT of the INCOMPLETE job of Partition.\n\n\nFor Partition to succeed, all the minorities should have been transferred to India, while the Muslims should have been given the choice to choose either India or Pakistan. But this never happened.\n\n\nSo, what can be done to rectify the botched job of Partition? By COMPLETING it, that is, by accepting minority refugees as citizens of India. India, in spirit, is still what it was before Partition - a unique land with an abundance of diversity. And hence, it\'s India\'s responsibility to complete the botched Partition and help the persecuted minorities of Pakistan, who are ultimately India\'s own people.\n\n\nNow, coming to the persecuted Ahmadiyya Muslims minority. They should NOT be provided Indian citizenship because, they are Pakistan\'s problem. Pakistan is an official Islamic nation, and it was formed so that the Muslims (who chose Pak) could live peacefully among their brethren without any *infidels*. And since Ahmadiyyas are Muslims, it\'s Pakistan\'s job to give them justice, not India\'s. NRC and CAB are NOT charitable policies, they are required to complete the botched job of Partition, that\'s it.'<br />Author: 'sbnprd'  id: 'e03yse'<br />Score:58<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/e03yse/dispelling_the_absolute_bogus_narrative/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Everything you need to know about Electoral Bonds'<br />Body: '**Background**\n\nPolitical parties in India accepts donations from the individuals as well as from the Corporate entities. However, one of the major problem with respect to political funding of elections is that they lack transparency with respect to this fundings. \n\n1. In 2017, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) report suggested that 70% income of political parties comes from unknown sources. | https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/adr-funding-political-parties-congress-bjp-sp-956917-2017-01-24\n\n2. The 255th Law Commission Report on Electoral Reforms observed that opacity in political funding results in “lobbying and capture” of the government by big donors.  | http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/Report255.pdf\n\nThis lack of transparency in the political funding of Elections has led to innumerable problems. For example :\n\n1. It has given scope for the flow of black money,\n \n2. It enables big corporate entities as well as super-rich individuals to influence government policies and finally,\n\n3. It goes against the spirit of democracy since the interests of the common man are superseded by the interest of the big corporates as well as the super-rich\n\nTo solve these problems the government of India introduced the Electoral bonds in the 2017 budget.\n\n**What are Electoral Bonds?**\n\nAny corporate entity or an individual who is willing to donate money to a political party can buy an electoral bond from a designated bank such as State Bank of India and this electoral bond gets deposited into the bank account of the concerned political party. However, there are certain aspects to it : \n\n1. Electoral bonds can be made only to the eligible political parties i.e Parties that have secured at least 1% vote in the recent Lok Sabha or assembly elections.\n\n2. Electoral bond can be bought only in the form of Cheque or Digital payment.\n\n3. Denominations available will be multiple of 1000, 10,000, 1lakh, 10lakh and 1 crore.\n\n4. Maturity period for the bond is 15 days\n\n5. The identity of the donor will not be revealed to the political party\n\n6. There is no concept of interest on the electoral bonds\n\n7. These bonds are in the form of the promissory notes i.e the designated bank remains a custodian of the donor funds until the time the political party redeems the electoral bonds\n\n**Pro’s of electoral Bonds**\n\n1. Electoral bonds cannot be bought by using cash they can be bought only digital payment or cheque and use of cash is strictly prohibited - This provision checks the flow of black money \nduring the elections and secondly as the bank followed that know your customer (KYC) norms the bank would have the idea about the identity of the donor leading to greater transparency\n\n2. Electoral bonds would also bring about transparency in the functioning of political parties  - \nElectoral bonds can be encashed into the bank account which is, in turn, is monitored by the Election Commission and secondly, the political parties are under obligation to disclose the total amount of donations received under the electoral bonds\n\nThus, it can be stated that as against the earlier system, under the electoral bonds we are able to :\n\n1. capture the identity of the donor \n\n2. the political party who receives the donations\n\n3. the total amount of donations received by a political party\n\n4. the nature of expenditure undertaken by a political party\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. Individuals can make cash donations to the political parties up to rupees 2000 and these cash donations are not required to be disclosed by the political parties\n\n2. Amendment to Foreign Contribution and Regulation Act - this enables political parties in India to accept the donations from the foreign companies so this particular provision can enable the foreign companies to influence the government policies.\n\n3.

AFAIK, AIB do not wish to listen to anyone with an opposite view. Counter AIB with facts and they label you as a "Racist Sanghi Brown Chaddi".\n\nThe core of AIB\'s jokes was Indianness. They would make fun of anything Indian. From mannerisms to language, anything Indian for them was to be relentlessly mocked. Add that with a large garnish of "Maderchod, Bhenchod, Lavdu" and few people would laugh. And because of Social Proof, we would laugh with them. It is an Old TV Trick, where they add laugh tracks to some scenes to make it appear. \n\nAnyone who has countered them on Twitter knows that instead of replying with facts, all they do is mock you and label you. \n\nAnd they ended up getting really rich doing it.\n\n*The Ironical Twist*: Mahima Kukreja did the same to them.

Last year, Mahima Kukreja was a damsel in distress, today it is Utsav. We are quick to pounce on anyone and anything instead of listening to the other side. A label is very powerful.

      <li>Title::: 'Should India have pre-election prime-ministerial debates?'<br />Body: "This might sound ridiculous as Indians vote for constituency candidates and not their prime ministers, and by no means is India a two-party democracy. However I think the people should get a chance to reason about party manifestos instead of accepting them as gospel. Parties must list out 10 actionable points that they want to achieve in the next 5 years, and there must be a review at the end of their term to judge their success or failure in implementing these policies.\n\nAs an example, BJP had talked about cleaning up rivers in 2014 as well as in 2019. There must have been a draft plan of what they plan to achieve in the 5 years from 2014, otherwise the manifesto is just an aspirational think piece. A debate would have brought their actions under review, and informed the people about where they stand and where they would get to in 5 more years. [Hundreds of crores set-aside for the Namami Gange plan lie unspent](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/water-management-to-be-modis-priority-if-nda-is-re-elected/articleshow/69389336.cms?from=mdr), and questions must be asked why.\n\nA debate gives the opposition to raise obvious missteps and question the government on its actions. Issues like demonetization need to be reasoned about and not quietly forgotten. India's growth story depends on stable economic decisions and not electoral gimmicks. [As much as 99.3 per cent of the junked Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes have returned to the banking system](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/water-management-to-be-modis-priority-if-nda-is-re-elected/articleshow/69389336.cms?from=mdr). The seemingly dictatorial step has had widespread negative consequences in the country, and yet the people have to accept what they are dealt. Right now the Supreme Court stands as the only body keeping a check on the misuse of power by the government, eg the Aadhar money-bill issue, but this should really be the opposition's job first, and one that must be publicly revisited before the next election. \n\nAt present India is very much a country where people are illiterate, and vote based on their narrow prejudices. However this might change to some degree if the political overlords are made to speak up and be held accountable. People have short memories and politicians love to misuse this fact, so a timely reminder would go a long way to make sure that the voting is informed."<br />Author: 'slipnips'  id: 'dzi46w'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dzi46w/should_india_have_preelection_primeministerial/</li>

Below is correspondence between his Secretary, Dwarka Nath Kachru who was accompanying the Army in the Kashmir operations of 1947:\n\n*Kachru wrote to Nehru: “The military operations are going on successfully and according to plan and gradually large areas are being liberated and reclaimed. If, however, the request of General Thimmaya is acceded to and some more troops are loaned to him, we may in the very near future find ourselves in the occupation of Muzzafarabad and a substantial part of Poonch Jagir.*\n\n*“Our troops have fortunately for us created a very good impression on the whole and are generally popular with the civilian population. But there is a peculiar feeling gradually creeping in the minds of our soldiers and the officers and whenever I had an occasion to visit them at the fronts, they have spoken to me freely and frankly hoping that their feeling would be communicated to the Government. They feel that our Government is not taking the matter of Kashmir very seriously and are not fighting the war as it should be. The Government, according to them, is anxious to avoid getting casualties and is therefore asking the Commanders to be deliberately cautious. The war therefore promises to be long drawn and that has created a sense of frustration in our troops. They are anxious to fight and are hopeful that if the Government gives them permission to go ahead and finish the job, they would be able to do so. There are bound to be casualties for which the Government should be prepared, but being superior in arms and training, they are hopeful about the outcome."*\n\nNehru not only muddled the Kashmir issue but also frustrated the troops.\n\n[Source](https://www.orfonline.org/research/nehrus-pacifism-and-the-failed-recapture-of-kashmir/)\n\nLater, Nehru joked with Field Marshal Kodandera "Kipper" Madappa Cariappa " Only if I had given you 15 days more, Kashmir would be a different issue".'<br />Author: 'JainBeef'  id: 'dzgxhm'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dzgxhm/when_un_grandstanding_takes_precedence_over/</li>

Gen Thorat, was the Chief Of Eastern Command .He along with then COAS Kodandera Subayya Thimayya foresaw a Chinese attack as early as 1960.\n\nThorat had also conducted war exercises (Operation Lal Quila) to figure out how to repel the Chinese attack. However, his proposal fell on deaf ears. Neither Nehru, nor Menon, the then Defense Minister actually gave a damn. The Ministers thought they could contain China "diplomatically".\n\nYet, Nehru/Menon kept ignoring the advice.\n\nHere is an example from [DailyO](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/why-centre-must-declassify-vk-krishna-menon-papers-on-1962-india-china-war-spp-thorat-clash-between-army-and-defence-ministry/story/1/25291.html):\n\n*When Thimayya retired in May 1961, it was expected that Thorat would succeed him as the Army chief. He was highly decorated, had combat experience, and was held in high regard in the service. Most important, he was GOC-in-C Eastern Command, and was familiar with the situation on the borders with China.”*\n\n*Unfortunately for India, Gen PN Thapar got the top job; though technically senior, he had little field experience but was pliable and* ***close to the minister****. An exchange between Gen Thapar and Lt Gen Thorat shows the pettiness of the then leaders; it occurred at a time Thorat was in the process of retiring.*\n\n*At 8am on June 24, 1961, Lt Gen Thorat received a letter from the Army chief who had been “asked” by the Prime Minister for his comments “on the following allegations against you (Thorat) which have come to his notice.” By the evening Thorat had answered all the points.*\n\nAnother blunder:\n\nNot using the Air Force to neutralise the [Chinese lines](https://www.rediff.com/news/column/why-we-must-acknowledge-the-blunders-of-the-1962-war/20121119.htm).\n\n*My Note: 21 November marks the last day of the Indo China war of 1962.

But there is a fucking serious design flaw. \n\nRight outside the Ennore and Katupalli port we have a fucking railways line with a HT power line running over it. Max height permitted is 4.8mtrs. If you want to move anything more, you pay RS 300,000 to the railways for every movement to shut down the power line. This is exorbitantly expensive and not feasible at all. \n\nWe spoke with the Adani operations team and were told that they have already filed a petition saying they will invest crores into a solution. The problem? The railways central board is sitting on it for months.  Only one file needs one sign and within a week this problem will be gone. \n\nThen comes another mindfuck. As these are second hand goods, 100% inspection is mandatory and the company being new can't avail AEO certification yet. The problem here is the docks are all dusty and these are hyper sensitive machinery they can only be opened in a controlled environment. So now we are again filing yet another petition for inspection to be allowed in their factory as a special case. \n\nMy Chinese partner said that for a plant of this importance, if it were China, everything from approval to construction would be done in 3 months flat.

What would make one use Humtog platform by Indian users? They should want to use it because it would give them **something** that\'s quick and easy and share; though the same something can be accomplished via multiple steps using other services. \n\nFor example this **something** could be India specific meme generator that can be made very quickly in 1 step and be shared on Facebook. I am just throwing out ideas.\n\nAs someone who has seen darker things of social networks, for me as a developer to be able to contribute I require that the software is open source. And the hosting service should demonstrably prove that they are running the "release" version of software on demand and transparently.\n\nAnd people should be able to make some side money, just a little bit off the platform.\n\nGood use cases (at least at this moment) aren\'t something that I find with the website. I mean, from the point of end user. I understand emphasis on openness/transparency in moderation etc but they are secondary/tertiary reasons. There has to be more solid use cases for general public to use.\n\nIn summary, I want the project to succeed.
