      <li>Title::: '3 Problems I have with my friends who support Modi.'<br />Body: "A bit about myself and my circle first. I work in an MNC at a medium level management position in Mumbai. Most of the friends I am talking about are my colleagues or people with similar jobs.\n\nSo here are my issues with them:\n\n1. They will advise you not to trust news sources like NDTV, The Print etc. (Even ABP news or Aajtak sometimes), reason being media has its own agenda and there's no unbiased reporting left in today's media. AND to drive this point home they'll send you an report from OPINDIA! I mean don't you see the irony.\n\n2. They are politically flexible af! None of my friends supported Yogi before 2017. He wasn't even the face of their campaign. After BJP had won everything they took  about a week to declare the CM's name. During that week also, BJP supporters were saying Yogi wouldn't be the CM. Point being THEY NEVER WANTED HIM. But once his name was announced, it took them less than a day to start defending him and his comments from back when he was just a fringe. Just the opposite has happened to their views on Shiv Sena after Maharashtra elections, just cause.\n\n3. Third problem I have is with those who don't admit they support the BJP. These people the worst. They are conveniently apolitical on any occasion they think they cannot defend the BJP. They echo all of BJP's narrative all the time, would never as much as acknowledge anything good some other party does. Dude IF you're apolitical then you should have been on the opposition's side at least once in last few years."<br />Author: 'bhand_liberal'  id: 'gepn52'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gepn52/3_problems_i_have_with_my_friends_who_support_modi/</li>

Reading of internal files:**\n\nClickbait issue, this is zero severity security issue. It would require physical access to an unlocked device at which pointed you have bigger concerns. Highlighting this issue and making it seem like attacker can read phone files is just plain malicious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technical details:**\n\nThe app has a internal webrowser ( Webview activity ) and fs0c131y demonstrated that the in-app browser can read internal files. This is just android 101 and a non-issue. \n\n \n\n**2. Knowing the infected  / unwell stats at a given area.**\n\nNow this is a somewhat complicated issue. The developers consider knowing these stats at a location a feature, this is for you to know the stats of your neighborhood. \n\nHowever as the app tells you the stats for a radius of 500m, thus you can by requesting stats of around 10 different nearby points (triangulation) to know exactly if at a location someone is unwell if they have marked the same in the app. However keep in mind that you only know the count and not any personal information (Name, age) about the people at the location.\n\nNow you can't scale this attack, there are rate-limits on the API meaning you can only send only few requests per some time, but you can still pick few targets and know their status.\n\n**Is this is a privacy issue?**\n\nDepends on who you ask, but even if someone says it it is, the privacy leak is just very very small ( No PIIs )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't believe me, here is India's top security professional saying the same thing\n\n1.[https://twitter.com/akhilreni\\_hs](https://twitter.com/akhilreni_hs) \\- **CTO at WeSecureApp**\n\n[https://twitter.com/akhilreni\\_hs/status/1257773937187885056?s=20](https://twitter.com/akhilreni_hs/status/1257773937187885056?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/akhilreni\\_hs/status/1258061781005504518?s=20](https://twitter.com/akhilreni_hs/status/1258061781005504518?s=20)\n\n[https://twitter.com/akhilreni\\_hs/status/1257725612094963712?s=20](https://twitter.com/akhilreni_hs/status/1257725612094963712?s=20)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.

Pure clickbait.\n\nHe claimed he found vulnerabilities in the mAadhaar app where the app used hardcoded passwords inside the app, what he failed to mention was that the encrypted file resided in the app sandbox ( meaning not accessible to other apps ) , you need root to access the file at which point if someone has root access on your phone, mAadhaar becomes the least of your worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This is what this guy does, creates chaos for non-technical audience, gets into the politics ( such as by unnecessarily tagging Rahul Gandhi ) and fools his new found audience via clickbait.**\n\n**I am not saying the Aarogya Setu app is 100% secure, but this guy didn't prove shit.**"<br />Author: 'pgoi'  id: 'geoycw'<br />Score:227<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/geoycw/truth_about_fs0c131y_and_his_aarogya_setu_bugs/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Is it democratic for the Indian government to keep extending lockdown?'<br />Body: "On 24th March 2020, When prime minster of Indian Mr. Modi came on television to announce nationwide lockdown for 21days, We all supported that move as it was the need of time, On 24th of march, Covid-19 was 3 months old. China's new cases were on declining  Italy and other European countries were mourning on the death and the USA was gearing up for the worst.  India's total count of the case was 564. \n\n21 days of the first lockdown was good enough time for the government to plan, act, and give a clear vision to citizens on our exit strategy. but despite that PM Modi comes on television one more time and without giving clear vision extended lockdown for another 2+ weeks. This time was additional time bought to prepare government machinery to restart the nations. \n\nbut then comes on the 3rd of May, this time PM doesn't even care to come on television and address the nations. lockdown extended one more time with a just press release from the Home ministry.  \n\nHow democratic this whole lockdown process is? \n\nI have the following points if you wish to discuss this. \n\n1. There is no Dialogue between the Government ( Particularly from PM) to Citizen, like supreme leader of North Korea, PM is making announcements on State TV. Nobody can ask him the questions of follow up. NO PRESS BRIEFING. while leaders of all the democratic countries are doing daily press interaction, there is transparency from the government. \n2. The government is not providing the Exist strategies. we have identified RED, ORANGE and GREEN ZONE, but current government policy to tag RED to ORANGE and then GREEN is very vague.  A city like Mumbai will never reach ZERO new cases any time soon. The government should do a detailed program on what they are planning to metro and other big cities that has a higher number of cases. \n3. The government is not defining their own deliverables. In every briefing, government official comes and tells us what Citizen should do. but never define their own task. Like if they extending lockdown for two weeks, what they will do in this two week, what is their target new case goal.\n\nRight now there is a huge trust deficit between people and government. And recent queue for liquor shops is an example of that. People want to buy everything on first day as they have no trust in the government that they will keep that next day. and rightly so, as some state increase the price while others retracted the order.  How can few people in government determine Liquor is essential or not.\n\nI wish the current government function more like a democracy where they share more information with people, tell more about what they planning to do. Give us an exit plan, give us hope,\n\nNOT just extending lockdown.  People are frustrated and depressed.

Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers.**  \n**PURPORT**  \nOne who has actually come to understand one\'s constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcendental loving service to the Lord. Such devotional service is the right course of action for the living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and that will make one\'s life successful. Like the misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the Lord.  \n**Question 1 : Why people who desire to enjoy the fruits of their actions are referred to as misers by the Lord ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](5jmj27hu92x41 "Chapter 2: Contents of the Gita Summarized\n")\n\n  \nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gec4v3'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gec4v3/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_249/</li>

Because the others will inevitably come in contact with those didn\'t - in the form of team members, building residents, shop workers, vegetable vendors &amp; many such more.\n\nFurthermore, there is a large scale migration of the labourers, out of state tourists &amp; emergency travelers under way as well. Therefore someone who stood in line in Bangalore today could well infect their neighbour in Nagpur, 3 weeks from now. \n\nThe entire decision to ban inter &amp; intra state transport from March till May has suddenly been rendered completely useless. \n\nAlso, if revenue for state coffers alone was the priority - why wasn\'t home delivery of alcohol allowed. \n\nThere have been dozens upon dozens of articles &amp; reports about how cab drivers, food delivery agents, industry / factory labourers - are all out of jobs. \n\nWhy weren\'t they rounded up, trained, tested &amp; tagged in the system - and then deployed for the purpose of delivery - while having Centre / State sponsored equipment for safety? Basic gloves &amp; masks would\'ve sufficed - instead of medical grade PPEs. \n\nSurely, a week\'s delay in opening the shops would\'ve caused no critical impact? It would substantially boosted THEIR LIVES as well - as a confirmed source of legitimate income rather than adding their weight to government liability &amp; welfare schemes. \n\n[The one thing that set India apart from US, UK, Italy, France &amp; a whole host of other nations was the much lauded nation wide lockdown.](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/140420/india-demonstrating-unwavering-commitment-in-its-fight-against-the-pan.html)\n\nIn one single, short term profit based move - all the goodwill &amp; benefits generated from this "scientifically undertaken" lockdown have been discarded. \n\nThe Centre vs State blame game / Political parties debate will persist long after this Coronavirus issue subsides - but all logic &amp; the lessons from global experiences points to the inevitable reality that the end of May 2020 will bring upon an exponentially high number of positive, Coronavirus virus infected cases across all demographics, across our nation. \n\nI will be glad to be proved wrong, but no amount of prayers will turn back the clock on this disastrous decision. \n\n&gt; "The ~~Good~~ Thing About Science is That It\'s True Whether You Believe It Or Not". - Neil DeGrasse Tyson\n\n#What we can do from today onwards - is to ensure that hospitals, healthcare professionals across the entire hierarchy, government &amp; private organizations, PPE &amp; medical infrastructure manufacturers are informed suitable so that they can brace for the exponentially enhanced volumes of work that awaits them in a couple of weeks from now.'<br />Author: 'vyrusrama'  id: 'gdwr0x'<br />Score:15<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gdwr0x/three_weeks_from_now_we_as_a_nation_will_be/</li>

The reasons for locking are generally where participants are breaching the sub rules but I didn’t really notice that and I guess it may be because the post gained immense popularity (more than 1.6k upvotes)\n3.

      <li>Title::: 'Story of Gilgit-Baltistan that belonged to J&amp;K and how it was separated and kept under direct supervision and control of Pakistan to favor the CPEC, China since 1962, after the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 is occupying nearly 19% of the territory of J&amp;K which includes vital territory of Northern Area'<br />Body: "*Blast from the past: My previously written post, hope you enjoy it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Understanding the Geography of Gilgit-Baltistan wrt Northern Area**\n\nGilgit-Baltistan (GB) has an unfortunate and tragic history as a region which is a part of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir but under Pakistan’s illegal occupation since 1947. Northern Areas is the name given by Pakistan after 1947 to the area comprising GilgitBaltistan. **This area has been neglected, isolated, disfranchised and its status kept deliberately ambiguous and undefined.** None of the constitutions of Pakistan of 1956, 1962, 1972 and 1973 recognised the Northern Areas as a part of Pakistan. Likewise, the 1974 interim constitution of Pakistan Occupied Kashimir (POK) also did not include Gilgit and Baltistan as its part.\n\nThe total geographical area of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is 222,236 sq. km. Of this, at present, 101,437 sq. km is under India’s administrative control. Parts of the territory of the Jammu and Kashmir are under illegal Pakistani/Chinese occupation. The POK, which consists of the so-called Azad Kashmir (herein after referred to as Azad Kashmir only to differentiate it from rest of PoK) and Gilgit-Baltistan, covers an area of 78,114 sq. km. Of this, the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan (Northern Areas), is five times the area of so-called Azad Kashmir. This apart, the area under Chinese control is 42,685 sq. Km, which includes 5,180 sq. km illegally ceded to China by Pakistan in 1963.\n\nIn 1970, Hunza and Nagar, a part of Azad Kashmir, were amalgamated with Gilgit-Baltistan. In 1982, Zia-ul-Haq proclaimed that the people of Northern Areas were not a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and extended his martial law to Northern Areas but not to the Azad Kashmir. With this act, he drew a clear distinction between Northern Areas and Azad Kashmir.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Twelve days later on April 15, 1982, the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, informed the Lok Sabha that Northern Areas are ‘Juridically and constitutionally part of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir.*\n\nIndia lodged an official complaint, with Pakistan Foreign Office and the Government was awaiting a response of the Pakistan Government. There was no official reply to this but Pakistan did not appoint an observer from Northern Areas to the Majlis-e-Shoora. ( Also General Zia had announced that three observers from Northern Areas would be appointed to the Federal Council or the Majlis-e-Shoora.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Separation of Gilgit-Baltistan from Azad Kashmir**\n\nRight from the beginning, Pakistan separated Gilgit-Baltistan from Azad Kashmir so as to maintain greater control over it. The people of GB filed a writ petition challenging the position of Pakistan on the status of Northern Areas in the High Court of Azad Kashmir in the 1990s in what came to be known as the Muskeen case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***The High Court of Azad Kashmir decided that the Northern Areas were a part of Azad Kashmir and its administrative control should be with the government of Azad Kashmir (POK) and not the government of Pakistan.***\n\n**Pakistan did not implement that decision and had it vacated by its Supreme Court**, which maintained that the High Court had no jurisdiction to issue any such order in the matter. It described the matter as political rather than a legal issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gilgit Baltistan Reform Order 2018**\n\nIn June 2018, the outgoing Abbasi Government of Pakistan decided to make some changes through the Gilgit Baltistan Reform Order 2018, which replaced the earlier self governance order of 2009. Under this new order, all powers earlier exercised by the Gilgit-Baltistan Council, including passing legislation regarding minerals, hydropower and tourism sectors, were shifted to the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly.\n\nThis order vests huge powers in Pakistan Prime Minister who in fact is far stronger then the Assembly. Opposition parties in Gilgit-Baltistan protested against this order as they felt that the new order enhanced the role of the Federal Government rather than resulting in any substantive devolution. They dubbed the order as Prime Minister centric.\n\n***The government of India also protested.***\n\n&gt;*The MEA statement mentioned that “the entire  5 state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ areas is an integral part of India” and “any action to alter the status of any part of the territory under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan has no legal basis whatsoever, and is completely unacceptable.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The role of Chine in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Gilgit-Baltistan**\n\nThe CPEC passes through POK which is a part of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. The shortest route from Gwadar to Kashgar runs through Panjgur, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Ismail Khan, and then into Punjab through Mianwali, onto Islamabad, and then the KKH to Xinjiang/Sinkiang. There were reports that China was not comfortable about the route passing through Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on account of protests against CPEC and the security situation prevalent in those areas. It was decided by the Pakistan Government on account of these considerations and because of reservations expressed by the governments of Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh to change the alignment of he route of CPEC, so that it could pass mainly through Punjab. As a result, the **CPEC is being dubbed as the China Punjab Economic Corridor.**\n\nChina was equally concerned about regular protests in Gilgit-Baltistan about CPEC as 600 km of the proposed 2,000 km Kasghar-Gwadar corridor passes through the region. Consequently, there has been apprehension that the pace of progress of implementation of the project could get affected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CPEC Route from Gwadar to Xinjiang\\/Sinkiang](https://preview.redd.it/kaqpf82bbsw41.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f4ffea2c1bd35325596c239fdb66209efaee41)\n\nNote: ***Couldn't get the route from K2K to Xinjiang/Sinkiang.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now comes the Chinese Role in Gilgit-Baltistan**\n\nPakistan favoured greater federal control over Gilgit-Baltistan on Chinese insistence.Some other media reports revealed that there are more than 5,000 Chinese troops across the Middle-East and Asia to protect China’s economic corridor. The largest number (1800) in this list is deployed on the China-Pakistan corridor. Many of them could be stationed in the POK, and be a cause for concern in India.\n\n***Here is more on it*** \\- [https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/1827428\\_re-nyt-story-about-chinesetroops-in-pakistan-snorthern.html](https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/18/1827428_re-nyt-story-about-chinesetroops-in-pakistan-snorthern.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So why was Gilgit-Baltistan separated from Azad Kashmir and kept under direct supervision and control of Pakistan ?**\n\nAnswer is CPEC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Agreement of 2 March 1963**\n\nPakistan transfers or cedes areas to China in 1963, south of the Mintaka Pass, belonged to Hunza. Border Agreement of 2 March 1963 changed the alignment of the boundary line between the Sinkiang province of China and the contiguous area under the actual control of Pakistan.\n\n&gt;India protested to both Pakistan and China about this agreement. Ceding territory to China was not even discussed in Gilgit-Baltistan as it did not have any elected assembly of its own. Articles I, II and VI of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement, accepted that the area covered by the Agreement was disputed.\n\nIf you look at the Article VI, China concedes that the area is not under the sovereign control of Pakistan, a fact that becomes important when seen in the context of the CPEC. Both history and sovereignty issues do not favour Chinese arguments here. They are, therefore, using commercial arguments for their political and strategic investments in Pakistan for transiting through POK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe location of Giligit Baltistan is unique. In addition to India and Pakistan it has borders with Afghanistan and China. India’s stand about GB being a part of the Indian State Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been consistent.\n\nPakistan has shown greater concern for the territory of Jammu and Kashmir it occupied than for the people living there. It is quite evident the way Pakistani governments handled the issue. None of the governments at the helm have ever shown any genuine interest to address the issues pertaining to the economic and the political interests of the people of the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How Demography was changed**\n\nThe demography of the area has been changed. Outsiders were settled in this area to achieve this objective. In 1948, Shias and Ismailis constituted 85 per cent of the population of the area. Today it is around 50 per cent. Shias, Ismailis and Sunnis—lived peacefully in communal harmony till the 1970s in the Kashmiri tradition prevalent before 1947. Differences started to emerge from 1975 onwards.\n\nSkardu has a predominantly Shia population. The Sunnis have lived mostly in Diamir, and the Ismailis in Hunza. **The first sectarian clash occurred in 1975 when a Shia Muharrum procession was fired at from a Sunni mosque in Gilgit**. The next major clash was in 1998 over the sighting of the moon to mark the end of Ramadan. By this time, sectarian violence had become a common occurrence, and manifested itself even more after the killing of foreign mountaineers in 2014.\n\nNow the Shias and Sunnis have started living in separate areas and this has adversely affected cohesion\n\nThe Karakoram Highway (KKH) linking Pakistan with Gilgit-Baltistan has resulted in the influx of weapons and drugs and attacks by religious militia into the region, leading to a change in demography. The non-violent Ismaili community also started becoming targets of attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***The desire of the people of Giligit-Baltistan to be connected with India has always been prevented and suppressed by Pakistan.***\n\nTwo land routes—Kargil and Leh on the Indian side of the LoC connect with Skardu and Khaplu (PoK side) but Pakistan has not permitted interaction on these routes.\n\nNorthern Areas were separated from rest of PoK to ensure greater Federal Control. There has been pandering to China’s concerns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***China since 1962 and after the Sino-Pak agreement of 1963 is occupying nearly 19 per cent of the territory of J&amp;K which includes some vital territory of Northern Area.***\n\nChina and Pakistan have been using the territory of the area to the determent of Indian interest.\n\nThe area and suffering of the people of GB has been completely neglected just like how the international community  closed their eyes to the genocide of Kashmiri Hindus. It is high time they took note of the sufferings faced by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and the people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir , including the Northern Areas which was once part of the state of Jammu&amp;Kashmir.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Sources:***\n\n***Based on a speech delivered by the author at the Annamalai University on 9th August 2018.

It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls."  \n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  \n**Question 2 : Who is considered to be the highest Vedantist ? What reference from the Vedic literature is given to prove the same ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** "Vedānta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Vedānta philosophy is Lord Kṛṣṇa; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."  \n\'The living entities are parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa; therefore, revival of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.33.7) as follows:  \naho bata śvapaco\'to garīyān  \nyaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam  \ntepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā  \nbrahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te.  \n"O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a cāṇḍāla \\[dog eater\\], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage.

Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThere are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one's prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.\n\nAs far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for results. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\n\nArjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.\n\n**Question 1 : What are the three considerations related to work ? Which one of them Lord Krishna advised to Arjuna and Why ?**\n\n**Question 2 : FITB : One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action.

      <li>Title::: "Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)? AskIndia"<br />Body: ' \n\nNote: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)\n\nA little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people\'s lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).\n\n**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner\'s first and last(and being your partner\'s first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - "hey, its not practical man" way, but in a "you just cant" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner\'s past is none of your concern.\n\nI still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife\'s/husband\'s past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**\n\n**My questions are -**\n\n1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe\'s past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)\n2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?\n3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?\n4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.\n\nPlease dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).\n\nAnd sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.\n\nPS:\n\nBy intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.\n\nAnd I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)\n\nIts not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn\'t. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)\n\nAnd no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.'<br />Author: 'curiouspupil'  id: 'gcrtzz'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gcrtzz/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/</li>

We should acknowledge them more.'<br />Body: ' \n\n\\*\\*Disclaimer: this post is based on my personal experience and interactions with people over the last 8 years since I completed high-school. You\'re welcome to disagree. \\*\\*\n\nThe title says it all. Missionaries have done a lot of good in this country. The RSS Shakhas don\'t come anywhere close.\n\nOnce upon a time, I used to study in a missionary school (one of the St. Xaviers schools). My parents didn\'t have to pay much in terms of fees, and I didn\'t face any discrimination as a Hindu. The only thing I was not encouraged to participate in were the church services, and honestly that was a blessing as a kid. Had more free play time. I switched to another school later because my parents wanted something closer to home (we moved to the suburbs).\n\n**The missionaries have done a lot of good for India and made parts like the North East and Kerala very well educated**. Most tourist guides in north-east states are better versed about news and current affairs than my Delhi based office colleagues. The education contribution of missionaries is so good that many schools these days get fake names (St. Agnes, St. Annes, St. Francis etc) sounding like missionaries just to sell themselves to the parents, despite being owned by banias. ***The economic contribution of missionaries has never been acknowledged, and probably never will.***\n\nAs for the often reported statistics about "conversion" in tribal societies, well, if an organization gives your kid a world class education, gives you food and often a basic job, do you consider that place a god or not? **What\'s the purpose of a god for a poor person? To provide basics, and dignity?** They do that.\n\n***In cities, there\'s no conversion coercion and you\'ll see an equal number of Christian Muslim Hindu Jain kids in a missionary school.***\n\nI wish that these states get the industries they deserve and thrive. It pains me to see the educated north east youngster struggle in Delhi.

      <li>Title::: 'Clueless Indian adoptee seeking your insight on Indian culture and family dynamics.'<br />Body: 'Clueless Indian adoptee seeking your insight on Indian culture and family dynamics. \n\n\nHi all. I was directed to this sub. It’s fine to delete if my post doesn’t fit here. \n\nI’m American, female, adopted from India as an infant, recently reunited with my bio family. My lack of knowledge about Indian families is causing much curiosity and confusion on my end. I don’t know any Indians in real life so I’m asking you, Reddit. \n\nFor context, my Indian family lives in a rural village in a southern area in India. Bio parents passed when I was an infant. I have five older siblings and many, many relatives. Most of them speak some English, but not enough for me to fully understand what they mean. We connect via social media, video calls, and texts.\n\nI grew up in the U.S. in a white family, white suburb, white world. I often say my brown skin is the only thing Indian about me. Middle of four siblings, all of whom are men. My adoptive family and I are very close. They are all thrilled that I am reconnecting with my birth family. \n\n**Here are my questions:**\n\n**What are some differences between American families and American marriages, and Indian families and marriages?** A few Indian family members assumed/assume I’m in an arranged marriage. **Is it common for Indians to assume that of Indians, regardless of where they live in the world?**\n\n**Is my assumption correct, that in India, extended family members and immediate family members are more like one giant immediate family?** My reunion is like My Big Fat Greek Wedding... it is very entertaining. Love finding out I have a big, happy crazy family. \n\n**Are there any American mannerisms or behaviours that can inadvertently offend an Indian?** Broad question, I know. Good to know before I travel there one day. \n\n\n**Is it a given that younger people accept direction from those older than them? Without question?**\n\n**Is there a cultural reason behind one of my brothers not giving me the numbers of other brothers?** Says it is because he doesn’t want my photos seen by others and my interaction with our family to go only through him. What gives? My other Indian brothers— and extended Indian family at large—- all adore me and vice versa, just like I do with this brother. Might be connected to my next question...\n\n**Is it common for older siblings to take on a parental role over younger siblings?** My oldest brother is acting more like a parent than a sibling towards me. Confuses the heck out of me. For me, adult siblings have a sibling-to-sibling relationship. **Is that different in rural India?**\n\nI didn’t find my siblings only to suddenly be treated as less of an adult that I am. My own siblings here are all adults and we treat each other as such. \n\nTrying to be culturally sensitive, but as an adult I’ve never had a family member attempt to order me around before, much less one I only recently knew existed. It feels suffocating in a way. \n\n\nHe doesn’t like it when I (politely yet firmly) tell him no, refuse to comply with his demands, tell him it’s not his place to tell me who I talk to, etc, etc. But oh well, he doesn’t have to like it. Wish I could remind him that we’re both equals, both adults, but I don’t think that would make sense to him.\n\n**Again, is it common for older siblings to act more like parents?** My brother doesn’t want other family members to continue to connect with me on social media. Some of his reasons are he is afraid my adoptive parents won’t let me visit India (no idea why my adoptive parents would have anything to do with that; I’m not a child and they certainly don’t treat me as one), thinks my husband won’t like it (again, what? He and I shared a good laugh at that one), thinks my new relationship with my bio siblings will be tainted if I interact with the others,... again, confusing. Can anyone shed some light on this from an Indian perspective?\n\nNot that it’s anyone’s business what I do (and I’ve told him as much), but I am slightly baffled at his misplaced and mistaken sense of authority over my life.\n\nI love my new Indian family, don’t get me wrong! I’m just confused about a few Indian things, and I think some people in my family are assuming I’m more Indian than I am. \n\n\nTL;DR: Adult Indian adoptee in reunion confused about Indian family dynamics.

Most businesses want the people who reach their website to either call them or fill up the form that is available on the website. Implementing conversion tracking would allow you to measure how many of these leads were generated through Google Ads and help you judge its profitability.\n\n## What You’ll Need?\n\n* Google Analytics Account\n* Google Tag Manager Account\n* Google Ads Account\n\n## Google Analytics\n\nGoogle Analytics is a free tool that lets you track everything that happens on your website. How many people visited your site, where were your visitors from, where is the traffic coming from, what pages of the website are most popular, what are users doing on my website and more can be answered through Google Analytics. Here is a [guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-analytics) that will help you understand a bit more about Google Analytics. Here is another [guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) that will help you create an account for it, but don’t install the code yet. We will be doing that through Google Tag Manager. Just copy the tracking ID and keep it ready.\n\n## Google Tag Manager\n\nThis free tool will allow you to deploy and manage various marketing tags on your website. So instead of adding numerous tags which might slow the website down, you just add one GTM (Google Tag Manager) code. You can read a bit more about it [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en).\n\n## Setup\n\n* Head [here](https://tagmanager.google.com/) and log in with your business’s gmail account\n* Once here click on “Create Account”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/85EcvMb)\n* Enter an account name and choose the right country. Also enter the “Container name” which is usually the name of the website on to which this code will go on. If there are more than one websites, suggest creating multiple containers in the account. Select “Web” as you target platform and hit “Create”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/PwzH9J7)\n* Accept all the terms and conditions and move to the next window. Here you’ll be greeted with instructions on how to install the code. [Reference](https://imgur.com/EAfjtij)\n* If you can do it yourself, paste the first part of the code as high as possible in the header and the second part of the code right after opening the &lt;body&gt; tag of all pages of your website. If you can’t do this on your own, copy and send the instructions to your developer. Hit OK\n* First thing we do now is connect Google Analytics to this. Find and head in to “Variables”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/nJwQ2DT)\n* Click on “New”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/jIdz65y)\n* Give it a suitable name and click on “Variable Configuration”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/bgGSM0B)\n* Scroll down a bit in the window that opens and look for “Google Analytics Settings” and click on it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/xK8Po56)\n* Paste the tracking ID in the space provided, open “More Settings”, look for “Advertising” and click on “Enable Display Advertising Features” and click “Save”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/1Xb3o1P)\n* Head to “Tags” and click on “New”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/oVweDgT)\n* Give this tag an appropriate name and click on “Tag Configuration”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/W2XHZJy)\n* Here all we need now is the Google Analytics tag, but you can take a look at all the tags GTM allows you to connect and launch. Click on “Google Analytics: Universal Analytics". [Reference](https://imgur.com/hqqyCay)\n* Open up the “Google Analytics Settings” drop down and select the Google Analytics variable we just created. [Reference](https://imgur.com/K6iJuPj)\n* Then click on “Triggering” and select “All Pages” and hit “Save”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/VV3dAMX)\n* Press “Submit” then click on “Publish” and then click on “Continue” to upload the changes to your website. [Reference](https://imgur.com/YwEPnWs). [Reference](https://imgur.com/ru9kogH). [Reference](https://imgur.com/kNZCsP6)\n\nThis setup process will ensure that you have published the GTM code on to your website and that you have connected Google Analytics to it as well. Before we move ahead, make sure you are linking Google Analytics and Google Ads as well. Here is a [link](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033961?hl=en) detailing how you can do that.\n\n## Tracking Conversions\n\nThere are two types of conversions we will be looking at - form submissions and phone call conversions. Let us start with form submissions.\n\n## Form Submissions\n\nThere can be a couple of types of forms on a website. One where you are redirected to a “Thank You” page after submitting the form and the other that loads up a small message on the same page when the form has been filled up. We will look at how to track the first one here. Always try to have a “Thank You” page for your forms as tracking leads becomes simpler, but if for some reason you are compelled to use the other method you will have to get in touch with your developer to help you out with setting up the tracking.

      <li>Title::: "What is Church Planting: How Christian missionaries exploit the FCRA in India via NGOs. India’s total defence allocation (2011-12) was Rs 1,64,000 crore. The foreign-funded NGOs (FFNGOs) in 2011-12 received seven percent of India's then defence budget. [Part-2]"<br />Body: ' In the last decade, more than Rs 85,000 crore has come in for the NGO sector from global patrons. \n\n \n\n*  Of the 40,000-odd NGOs registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation  Act (FCRA), at least half do not file proper accounts with the Ministry  of Home Affairs (MHA). \n*  As per a report published by the Home ministry for the year 2011-12,  there were 41,844 registered associations under the FCRA and some 22,702  NGOs reportedly received Rs 11,546 crore as foreign contributions. \n*  The minister said the FCRA registered NGOs in  the country have received a total of Rs 2,244.77 crore in 2018-19 (as on  November 28) and Rs 16,902.41 crore in 2017-18. \n*  As compared to 2004-05, the amount received in 2011-12 was up by 85  percent (from Rs 6,257 crore to Rs 11,548 crore) and their number 38  percent (from 30,321 to 41844). \n*  A total of Rs 1,16,073 crore was received by the NGOs between 1993-94 to 2011-12. Only about 55% NGOs gave audited account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Top Donors**\n\n* Among the list of donors, the United States tops the list (Rs 3838.23  crore) followed by the United Kingdom (Rs 1219.02 crore) and Germany  (Rs 1096.01 crore).\n* A majority of donors, including the top three, are church-based  organisations such as ,\n\n1. Compassion International USA (Rs 183.83 crore)  followed by \n2. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, USA (Rs 130.77  crore) \n3. the Kindernothilfe e.V. (KNH) Germany (Rs 51.76 crore).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**90% of them are into Missionary Activities**\n\n Of the top 15 donor agencies, 13 are related to some or the other  Christian sect. Over 90 percent of the top 30 recipient organizations  are engaged in missionary activity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**State\'s Receiving the most funds**\n\nThe highest amount of foreign contribution was received by the  following,\n\n1.  Christian organization namely World Vision India, Chennai (Rs  233.38 crore)\n2.  Believers Church India Pathanamthitta,  Kerala (Rs 190.05 crore) \n3. Rural Development Trust, Ananthpur, Andhra  Pradesh, (Rs 144.39 crore). \n\n \n\n***To put this in perspective, India’s total defence allocation (2011-12)  was Rs 1,64,000 crore. Thus, foreign-funded NGOs (FFNGOs) in 2011-12  received seven percent of India\'s then defence budget.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Nearly\xa0a  third of the foreign funds\xa0(total is \\~ Rs. 11000 Crore) coming in via  FCRA\xa0is being received by FCRA-NGOs who declare themselves in the FC6  returns as Christian.\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What is Church Planting ?***\n\n* Church  Planting is not only the establishment of a place of worship, but  should also be understood as the creation of new followers of  Christianity. Since Indian people in such locations (of Church Planting)  were following their native forms of worship within the folds of  Hinduism, it follows that\xa0these operators deliberately cut the people’s  umbilical cord with their ancestors in the process of church planting.  It may not be unlikely that\xa0they were converted.\n* Church  Planting in regions of the world where no Christian believers exist is  an activity for which US non-profit organizations can claim exemption  from paying tax.\xa0It is their law and we cannot do much about it.  However,\xa0Indians should be aware of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Story of Gorakpur Funding ?***\n\n* Gorakhpur  receives huge sums of money from a non-profit in Texas, USA each year.  The latter sends the money for an exactly defined purpose of “Church  Planting”,\xa0while the former claims such money is being received for  “Activities other than those mentioned above.”\n* Total  sum of Rs. 12.34 Crores has been received by this Gorakhpur based  Organization from the Texas based Organization between the period  2006—2013.\n* The  modus operandi of church planting, specific to India, are succinctly  described\xa0here,\xa0here\xa0and\xa0here. In the modern context, the church  planting movement (CPM) also encompasses the idea that such\xa0churches  should be\xa0reproducible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Voices Raised:**\n\n "We have 535 NGOs for 535 Indians. It means, we are the largest NGOed country in the world. The time has come to  scrap FCRA and ask the NGOs to seek local funds, argued Professor  Vaidyanathan of IIM Bangalore.\n\n&gt; *A significant portion of the received funds are used for ‘Establishment  Expenses’, which is against the basic cannon of charity work. It is  expected that charity involves lesser fixed assets creation,  particularly of the flamboyant nature. Also, the jet-setting aspect of  the NGOs provides clues to the nature of expenditure. Whether it is New  York or Geneva we find members of Indian NGO community lobbying for some  cause mostly of human rights. This creates a closed loop wherein they  receive money to further some agenda and for that they receive more  money,”* \n\n **Why the sufferings of a tribal man in Jharkhand be the concern of people in Denmark?** \n\n&gt; *"soul harvesting" or "planting of the Church" is an "anachronistic  practice" of 19th century, which is totally “incongruous in the 21st  century where “faith based political movements like the Church movements  are disappearing from Europe their cradle of growth”.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Govt of India\'s action**\n\n Ever since the Narendra modi **government** came to power in 2014, the Ministry **of** Home Affairs **has** cancelled the **FCRA** registration **of** over 14,800 **NGOs**, thus **banning** them from receiving foreign funding.  \n\n* Govt banned 14,500 NGOs under FCRA Act from receiving foreign funds\n\n Registration certificates of approximately 14,500 associations have been cancelled during the last five years," \n\nUnion minister of state  for home Nityanand Rai also said so far this year, the ministry has  cancelled FCRA registration of 1,808 NGOs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion,\n\n***“When  the missionaries came to Africa, they had the Bible, and we had the  land. They said, \'Let us pray.\' We closed our eyes. When we opened them,  we had the Bible, and they had the land.” - Desmond Tutu***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Source:***\n\n* *-* [*http://indiafacts.org/church-planting-in-india-via-foreign-ngo-funding-a-report-on-modus-operandi/*](http://indiafacts.org/church-planting-in-india-via-foreign-ngo-funding-a-report-on-modus-operandi/)\n* [*https://www.firstpost.com/india/scrap-fcra-ngos-church-work-foreign-funds-experts-2074339.html*](https://www.firstpost.com/india/scrap-fcra-ngos-church-work-foreign-funds-experts-2074339.html)\n* [*https://indiainteracts.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/ezra-sargunam-church-planting-land-grabbing-politics-and-communalization-under-the-guise-of-secularization/*](https://indiainteracts.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/ezra-sargunam-church-planting-land-grabbing-politics-and-communalization-under-the-guise-of-secularization/)\n* [*https://goachronicle.com/india-the-church-planting-garden/*](https://goachronicle.com/india-the-church-planting-garden/)\n* [*http://madhukishwar.blogspot.com/2018/02/joshua-project-in-action-strategies.html*](http://madhukishwar.blogspot.com/2018/02/joshua-project-in-action-strategies.html)\n* *Part -1 -* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8lu4nj/what\\_is\\_church\\_planting\\_how\\_christian/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8lu4nj/what_is_church_planting_how_christian/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n* [*https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/14-500-ngos-banned-by-govt-from-receiving-foreign-funds-119120400877\\_1.html*](https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/14-500-ngos-banned-by-govt-from-receiving-foreign-funds-119120400877_1.html)\n* [*http://fcraanalyses.blogspot.com/2019/12/fcra-ngo-recipients-of-foreign.html*](http://fcraanalyses.blogspot.com/2019/12/fcra-ngo-recipients-of-foreign.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Good Reads:***\n\n[*https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8afljc/the\\_conversion\\_war\\_and\\_religious\\_freedom/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8afljc/the_conversion_war_and_religious_freedom/)\n\n[*https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g2z3qj/how\\_the\\_congress\\_party\\_has\\_surrendered\\_to\\_the/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g2z3qj/how_the_congress_party_has_surrendered_to_the/)'<br />Author: 'Orwellisright'  id: 'gcpcb3'<br />Score:86<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gcpcb3/what_is_church_planting_how_christian/</li>

He sets up 2 simple criteria for picking his portfolio - Return on Capital of 15% and Revenue Growth of 10% year-on-year for the last 10 years. It\'s a really good read with back tested models and thorough analysis. We won\'t really get into the specifics here but feel free to read his book.  \nThe idea here is to treat your portfolio as a Fixed Deposit for 10 years. It is very difficult to keep a portfolio untouched especially when stock prices fall. It might be even harder when prices are rising and the urge to book profits kick in. However, we are going to resist this urge.  \nWe will post weekly updates on the value of our coffee can portfolio all the way from week 0 to week 520. Our corpus shall be close to INR 1 lakh to show that this can be achieved with a small portfolio as well (however, obviously, this can be done with significantly larger portfolios).\n\nThey are planning a coffee can portfolio with a corpus of INR 1 lakh.

Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nThe rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-kāṇḍa division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord Kṛṣṇa, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding Kṛṣṇa and one\'s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with Kṛṣṇa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā. The living entities are parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa; therefore, revival of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.33.7) as follows:\n\naho bata śvapaco\'to garīyān                                                                                                                                  yaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam                                                                                                                  \ntepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā                                                                                                    \nbrahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te.\n\n"O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a cāṇḍāla \\[dog eater\\], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Āryan family." So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Vedāntas and the Upaniṣads. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedānta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Vedānta philosophy; the best purpose of Vedānta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Vedānta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Vedānta philosophy is Lord Kṛṣṇa; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.\n\n**Question 1 : Why chanting the holy name of the Lord is so much stressed in Kali-yuga for self-realization ?**\n\n**Question 2 : Who is considered to be the highest Vedantist ? What reference from the Vedic literature is given to prove the same ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is77qrb48hw41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=404d62fd958202adc3915a338a2b9e62b6bb9ac1\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gckgvu'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gckgvu/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_246/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Rahul Gandhi is an Indian with a Western brain. Change my mind'<br />Body: "It's not just Rahul Gandhi, but the entire Congress elite, that's against the implementation of a national tracking application, despite it being extremely successful not just in Communist China, but in Democratic and thriving S. Korea. \n\nUsing the current pandemic as an example, people with Covid-19 get their movements tracked by the system. This has a double-benefit, because the non-sick can trace the approximate location of the sick, and the sick patient won't be tempted to violate self-isolation. If the sick tried to cheat by leaving their smartphone at home, then the app sends signal to authorities. **This is one of the many ways that S. Korea achieved their low transmission rate.** \n\nAnd as an Asian country with a similar density like India, there's no reason not to follow S. Korea's lead.  US and Europe are paying the price of over-emphasis on individual rights and privacy right now. **They don't seem to understand that corona doesn't care about their human rights.** If you don't stop individuals in a society who can put everyone else at risk, then you will have a national crisis. \n\nTherefore I suggest Indians to be pragmatic in this matter, instead of idealistic. After all, India is not located in the West, its a civilization of its own, so Western ideals may not best suit the Subcontinent."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'gcgmzo'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gcgmzo/rahul_gandhi_is_an_indian_with_a_western_brain/</li>

And one day, just like that, poofff! We're gone. Just because some asshole Islamic leader ~~ordered his hitmen~~ preached his disciples to go kill people for being kaafirs who are undeserving of life. A life that is a gift of God.\n\nAnd all this for what? What do they accomplish? Sadistic pleasure on seeing people's agony, literally ripped apart in pieces? Helpless crying voices calling out their injured loved ones to wake up, hang in and not leave? Or do they like listening to the wailing prayers asking God if this was the fruit of years of prayers and devotions that they deserved?\n\nBut the question is why do these people exist? And why are these braindead chutiyas blind enough to support / defend them time and again? (the likes of NDTV, who never even call them for what they are... FUCKING TERRORISTS. THEY ARE NOT ACTIVISTS. THEY ARE F-U-C-K-I-N-G TERRORISTS)\n\nAnd why can we not give out a strong message to these assholes to stop such preachings and mentality. Why do we have to wait for another Pulwama or 26/11 in order to take action? Why do we have to wait for even one person's death to take action? Is that one person's life not precious enough?\n\nThese attacks have been happening since forever and in all probability is gonna happen forever. These times are more fragile though.

The idea was 2/3rd of the cases were indeed impacted due to conditions of living. \n\nAnecdotally i have observed that a lot of my older relatives who have had simple lives (simple carb rich Indian vegetarian food, living in villages, hard work through their lives) and have rarely seen incidents of cancer. However when i look at celebrities despite their access to superior healthcare a lot of them do seem to have cancer in their life. Now, the thing is if you live old enough your probability of having some type of cancer increases automatically , but what would happen before in places like India and other developing countries is that people would die of other reasons.\n\nIn terms of lifestyle i think the biggest concern we face in India is particulate pollution followed by other influences. Also our mortality rate is highly impacted by Heart disease, diabetes and respiratory issues more than cancer which probably skews the number. I understand that primary reason for diabetes is carb rich Indian food coupled with unhealthy urban lifestyles.\n\nBut will it be reasonable for me to assume from the experience of celebrities and the relatively high rate of cancer in developed countries that indeed a simple lifestyle that avoids complex foods, smoking and alcohol (probably ?) helps and they are indeed causal factors.\n\nIn my extended circle of relatives that i know about i know only 2 cancer cases in the last 25 years.\n\nI am also interested in understanding your views on India specific risks we face and any lifehacks or suggestions you have. I am coming to an age where i am taking health seriously after a 12+ period of bad eating, stressful job and life in general.

Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.**  \n**PURPORT**  \nAll material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedānta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijñāsā, or questions on the Supreme Transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kāṇḍa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upaniṣads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gītā is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahābhārata. The Upaniṣads mark the beginning of transcendental life.  \nAs long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of Kṛṣṇa.  \n**Question 1 : Why the Lord gave Vedic wisdom to the human race ?**  \n**Question 2 : FITB : As long as the material body exists, there are \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48c5qfail9w41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb7706b8e496f7195048fc39beb53aaf45d763be\n\n  \nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gbyp51'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gbyp51/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_245/</li>

They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common."  \n"As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof."  \n"Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kānana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.42-43, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wct82hj7a6w41.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ab063207ccd3d788d7c42743c87050f2055bf1b\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

As water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can render the highest service to everyone-namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If Kṛṣṇa is satisfied by one\'s actions, then everyone will be satisfied."\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What is the role of a spiritual master in elevation to Krishna consciousness ?

As such, to be well-versed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Kṛṣṇa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\'s mission in life. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:  \nyasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo  \nyasyāprasādānna gatiḥ kuto \'pi  \ndhyāyaṁ stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri-sandhyaṁ  \nvande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam.  \n"By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nPeople in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-kāṇḍa portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotiṣṭoma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.\n\nIn the karma-kāṇḍa section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kānana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.\n\n**Question 1 : What characteristics of a sensual person have been mentioned in the verse ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fa216qj8jvv41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df08b76aef78f130dd615004a3aa3072cf409416\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gao23t'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gao23t/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_24243/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.40'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : How work done on the material plane is different from work done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Activity in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Kṛṣṇa without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no profit. "  \n"Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness carries the person again to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured brāhmaṇa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.40, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxtfrtsemsv41.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c13ef234f5833e713dae9f799ffac7fd8952d1c7\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Things this sub and we (Hindus) need to fix asap.'<br />Body: 'So this is going to be a long and interesting read for you and all I ask from you is to keep an open mind until the end of this post. \n\n\nContrary to the popular narrative of this sub, just virat-up and fight against anti national entities is an empty emotion with no real goal. \n\n\nThat narrative is similar to a fighter attending his match by ignoring a very bad injury and hoping for the best. It\'s gonna cost him in the match 100% at some point. British left us at 47 with a very broken society. All these reservations and educating everyone is something we\'re still achieving. A generation needs to cycle for real societal changes to be seen and internal conflicts between Hindus to subside. I don\'t know what they were designed to look like but British turned them into a cruelest thing ever. So when we see changes in the society through education and opportunities for everyone, that\'s when the wound is healed and then maybe you train for the match. Gotta give it time and wait out but meanwhile it\'s government\'s responsibility to make sure that the damage caused by external entities is negligible. A dalit won\'t just come and stand beside you and me for fighting an external entity when he feels like the external entity is better than you and me. You and I can\'t tell him that he\'s being taken advantage of, when he doesnt feel like that himself. \n\nSo the aggression and collective emotions going up among ourselves (the unaffected/upper caste Hindus) doesn\'t have any real potential. What we can do though is to keep showing people the other side of the story (of what left and Islam shows) through platforms like this sub but while maintaining discipline and not with vulgarity, superiority complex and edgy writing like many here does. If anything this collective blind aggression towards many things at once, keeps the nation from having a pro business outlook which stalls us. \n\nTalking of progress, money is what ultimately talks. If you observe the condition of Hindus today. We\'re not really respected by any other community even by fellow dharmic religions. Sikhs, Buddhists everyone looks down upon us. That is because Hindus are the majority 800-900 million of this land and both the good and the bad, this land can bring will be attributed to us as we are the ones who can truly bring prosperity to the land simply because we are the majority. This phenomenon is similar to a woman forgiving 100 mistakes made by a rich guy but highlighting a slightest inconvenience made by a struggling job seeker. \n\nTo conclude this , I\'m comparing our situation with this [movie scene](https://i.imgur.com/ieuphey.jpg) in which the character "Iron man" loses an arm in a fight with Hulk but instead of going aggressive with that one arm, he holds off Hulk with that arm which gives him just enough time to regenerate his other arm with spare parts and we Hindus in this time period are in this exact scenario where the job of this generation is just to hold on and heal our wounds, (which has more to do with self than external) to work on making our society better and equip it for a future in which we are in the position to face anything and not be broken up into multiple pieces with a slight hammer swing. It\'s time we take a practical approach for the greater good of our society rather than something that gives us instant gratification. If you observed certain sub reddits (not gonna name any) which hopes for our destruction, they\'re loving this latest trend of aimless aggression and youth having their focus split into hundreds of directions.'<br />Author: 'Kittykingg'  id: 'ga7icv'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ga7icv/things_this_sub_and_we_hindus_need_to_fix_asap/</li>

In China, the state actively forced assimilation and homogeneity. In both of these examples, we see that there are always communities within a civilization that yearn for a separate identity from the majority populace.\n\nIn India, that separate identity was always expressed through religion. People who lived in Pakistani Punjab used to be predominantly Buddhist during the time of Adi Shankara and now staunch Muslims; I believe the reason for that is because they always wanted a separate identity from those who lived in the Hindi belt. As for Sikhs, they're convinced that they're neither Hindus nor Muslims to their East and West.\n\nWhen the Dalit movement gathered momentum during independence, many became Buddhists, again to express that they're different from the majority around them. In recent times, we see a lot of Christian conversions in South India and the Northeast; I believe its because of the same reason, because they want a medium to express their difference to the North Indian majority and religion gives it to them. \n\nGoing further back in history, the Brahmins probably distanced themselves from the rest of society because they've always seen themselves to be different. These days a lot of Brahmins like Ram Guha and Kamal Haasan call themselves secular atheists, are they doing the same that their ancestors always did?\n\n**The point I'm trying to make is, India needs to work through all of these repulsive forces in society, but at the same time do it in a democratic way.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ga1v94'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ga1v94/in_india_religion_has_always_been_used_to_express/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The post COVID economic future of India looks worrying'<br />Body: 'It is a bit baffling to see that there has been no announcement of an industrial or a wage stimulus package yet.\n\nIt is now almost 40 days of zero to reduced economic activity, with logistics, labour and supply chains chains in total disarray. There is no clear plan ahead of when things can get to normal, or atleast when economic activity can restarted.\n\nCertain industries like travel, retail, hospitality and tourism is permanently damaged with that segment not expected to return to normalcy for atleast another year. The job losses in this segment itself is expected to catastrophic. Even an airline might fold up, like say Go Air or Spicejet.\n\nIf you look at MSMEs\n\n&gt; There are 633.88 lakh unincorporated nonagriculture MSMEs in the country engaged in different economic activities (196.65 lakh in Manufacturing, 0.03 lakh in Non-captive Electricity Generation and Transmission4 , 230.35 lakh in Trade and 206.85 lakh in Other Services)  The Micro sector with 630.52 lakh estimated enterprises accounts for more than 99% of total estimated number of MSMEs. Small sector with 3.31 lakh and Medium sector with 0.05 lakh estimated MSMEs accounts for 0.52 % and 0.01 % of total estimated MSMEs, respectively. Micro also accounts for 97% of the employment.\n\nThese enterprises do not have the cash balance to ride out 1 and a half months to possibly two months of no income. And even more when even after opening, the demand has crashed. The export oriented ones will find it tough to survive with slowed down demand from abroad.\n\nThis is before we even go into hundreds of millions who just daily labourers, pushcart sellers, or sells stuff from home etc. The many non-landowner farmers too. These people dont have any savings, and a the lack of income might push them to poverty. \n\nThen comes the tiny salaried class who also some might loose their jobs, will for sure recieve no pay hikes and might be slapped with a tax increase. This class which drives the consumption part of the economy will slowdown their spending sending a cascading effect down the whole economy. \n\nThere are the million or two who will probably not find a job this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor India, we were already in a downward spiral for the last two years. Production, lending, spending, earning was already at all-time lows. Now, to even get back to the point where we were, we would need to make sure that there is a similiar amount of demand as it were before. And that can only be ensured if the government ensures a softer landing by saving companies, jobs, give a sum of money to everyone, tax cuts, and infusion of a lot of cheap capital...(not to mention increase government spending)\n\nAll this has to be done during a time when tax revenues will be much much lower than last year and literally all other avenues of raising money like disinvestment is gone. So the government will need to borrow a lot, something which it is loathe to do so. The state governments are anyway bankrupt.\n\nSo at the end of the day India is in a very tight spot now. Neither the ordinary citizens nor the government can afford this lockdown and the country right now is basically living off its savings.  So, capability of the country to actually bounce back and grow going ahead looks very bleak. \n\nWhen a lockdown goes as long as it is going on in India (or it will), getting back to normal becomes tougher. Not only from a technical POV but from an optimism POV which is that breaks might send us into an Economic Depression.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'g9wvis'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g9wvis/the_post_covid_economic_future_of_india_looks/</li>

He issued an order, ‘farman’, that all the residents shift to Daulatabad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetail: "The one action for which the Sultan is criticized the most is his act of forcibly evicting the residents of Delhi from the city. The reason for this is that the residents used to drop letters sealed and marked ‘to be read by the Sultan only’ in the court of the Sultan. In this letters the Sultan was criticized and abused. These letters were dropped in the durbar at night. When he opened these letters, he used to find them full of abuses. **The Sultan decided to ruin Delhi**. \n\nHe bought their houses from the residents of Delhi and ordered them to seek refuge in Daulatabad. The residents did not find it acceptable. He made an announcement that the **city has to be vacated in three days** and no one should remain in the city after the expiryofhis deadline. Manypeople started emigrating but some of them hid in their houses. The Sultan gave orders to find out if there are some residents hiding in the city. The search by his slaves produced two men in the city. One of the poor guys was blind and the other was handicapped. Both of them were produced in front of the Sultan. The Sultan blasted  the handicapped  victim from a Manjanik (large catapult). The blind man was tied and forcibly dragged up to Daulatabad, which is at a distance of 40 days journey. He was shredded to pieces on the way and by the time they reached Daulatabad, only one leg was left. When  the residents saw this horrific scene, all of them left their wealth and property and vacated the city.\n\nThen Sultan climbed the roof of his palace and observed that there is no sign of fire or smoke from the city, indicating that the city was completely empty. The Sultan said, “Now I am satisfied and my heart is at peace”. Then he ordered the residents of other cities to populate Delhi. The city is so vast but only a few came to live in it. Delhi is one of the largest cities of the world. When we entered Delhi, there was no population in it and only a small number of houses were occupied."'<br />Author: 'just_a_random_member'  id: 'g9syy7'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g9syy7/til_the_origin_of_common_saying_tughlaqi_farmaan/</li>

Over and over again, politicians from both, the ruling party and the opposition have displayed their naivety and quick-marched into bait traps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe latest example is the way Congress over-reacted to the Arnab Goswami incident last week. He has been provoking the congress since the longest time, almost since his days at Times Now. His shouting  allegations is the bait. And this time, by calling the "mother" by her real name, the Congress freaked out! What did they think were they going to achieve by filing FIRs and attacking him? I think they completely over-reacted. Even in the best case scenario, they would have got him arrested and charged with some minor criminal offence (like defamation, because no other charges would stick). What would that have achieved? He would have come-out the other side, doing exactly the same thing, provoking them, perhaps in a new manner. But now that they have done the FIRs, they come out as impish and immature. They were headed towards a total wipe-out in the political game, and now with this, they have only accelerated their wipe-out. They have much to loose and almost nothing to gain. \n\nArt of War: Don\'t fight battles that you don\'t want to win. (I\'m paraphrasing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to balance the post, let me tell you how the BJP did so too. In Modi-1 they took an "Udta teer" up their hiney, when they sent forces and top party brass to JNU during the Kanhaiya Kumar protest. Everyone knows this has been happening in JNU since the longest time. The communist ecosystem no longer is a viable survival choice for academics. They are stupid students and should be treated as such. They should have been completely ignored by the government. I remember that even Rajnath Singh had issued a statement. He was the Home Minister in the what could be described as the strongest Union government that India had seen in decades prior. But he reacted to commie kids taking out a march from their hostel to the canteen and shouting stupid nonsense. There is no defense for what Commies at JNU did, but that certainly did not justify cabinet ministers response. Kanhayya, Umar khalid and other commies became heroes for the young rebellious types. One even contested in the Lok Sabha election, and got national coverage. \n\nArt of War: Don\'t create enemies where none exist. (Again, I\'m paraphrasing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I think that congress walked into the trap by over-reacting to Arnab.

But In India, people hardly know about this.\n\nour first Prime Minister Nehru voted against the formation of Israel in 1948. At that time, Savarkar criticized the decision of Nehru.\n\nThis is all because of appeasement politics in India as well as in External affairs. in-fact we showed our love more towards Palestine in the name of Gandhi ji policy.\n\nWell, the same Prime Minister Nehru asked secretly help from Israel in India-China War of 1962 and Israel helped us.\n\nDocument says Israel came to rescue India during 1962 Indo-Chinese war after Nehru wrote a letter and sought arms to fight with China.\n\nIsrael provide military assistance to India in Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

Israel was also one of the first countries to recognize Bangladesh following India’s victory in its 1971 war against Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the Book "Deception: Pakistan, the US and the Global Weapons Conspiracy" : Israeli Air Force was to launch an air attack on Pakistan\'s nuclear facility in Kahuta sometime during the mid-1980s from an airfield in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India. The book claims that "in March 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed off (on) the Israeli-led operation bringing India, Pakistan and Israel to within a hair\'s breadth of a nuclear conflagration".\nIsrael\'s plan met with disapproval from some Indian officials on the grounds that Israel would not face any major consequences after the strike while India would surely face full-scale retaliation—possibly nuclear—from Pakistan for its involvement in the Israeli attack.\n\nIsrael helped India in all of our wars even when we didn\'t have diplomatic relations in 1962, 1965, 1971. We formed relations in 1992. And, Israel &amp; USA are strong ally. But Israel always supported India in wars over Pakistan even though its ally of US who supported Pakistan in wars.\n\nIndia and Israel are natural ally, we have many in common including our history. But till 1991, we didn\'t have diplomatic ties.\n\nIn 1992, Our EX PM PV Narasimha Rao took lead in ties with Israel. He finally established diplomatic relations with Israel. He faced criticism too by our so called secular &amp; appeasement politics but he knew that he did the right thing and this is what India &amp; Israel deserves. Thanks to Narasimha Rao.\n\nIsrael did not condemn India\'s 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests. Israel rejected pressure from US &amp; many Countries sanctions against us. Israel stood with India at that time.\n\n2 major role of Israel in Kargil war 1999:\n\n1. Israel proved as best friend during Kargil conflict by quickly providing India with necessary laser-guided missiles for fighter jets.\n2.

What are the principles mentioned in it ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saṅkhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and saṅkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses."  \n"An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as sāṅkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\'s sāṅkhya, the sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puruṣa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakṛti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gītā. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakṛti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of māyā or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth."  \n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  \n**Question 2 : What is buddhi-yoga ? Why one should act according the principles of buddhi-yoga ?**  \n**Answer 2 :** "One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.39, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n![img](3sbb5vix9kv41)\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'Wish to start a petition to lower the volume of Mosque speakers significantly.'<br />Body: "I moved to Bangalore last year. I am staying in a Muslim area called mangamannapallya. There happen to be around 5 mosques around my area. So everyday I am bombarded with their prayer calls in my home around a dozen times(since the mosques aren't all in perfect sync). This happens in the morning when I am sleeping and have woken couple times cause of it, happens in afternoon when I am working and it is just a big nuisance throughout the day. This is something faced by a lot of people I know. What makes me really pissed is the blatant disregard these guys have for other people's peace, that too in the name of a made-up foreign god that they have literally no connection to. Bonded by their shared stupidity they fail to see the nuisance they are creating.   \nIt has been proposed multiple times before to set a decibel limit on the loudspeakers i mosque but it has never been implemented due to fear.

      <li>Title::: "[Rant] Rise up India! It's your time again."<br />Body: '1\n\nLet me take you back about 10 years. The year is 2009, moving into 2010. The entire world is still reeling under severe stress caused by the financial market meltdown. World over central banks and governments are struggling to keep banks afloat, companies solvent, and keep jobs intact. World reels from negative growths i.e. contraction in the economy. That\'s a huge problem. Investors and capital markets are fleeing and searching for safe havens.\n\nUS is in doldrums. Fed has just done it\'s first QE, in what would become a series of 4 official QEs. Japan is in brink of bankruptcy, almost on the ledge. One bad tumble, it would be over for the once-great economy. Europe is blown to bits. The banks are failing left and right. There are constant threats of countries leaving Eurozone. Cost of bailing out the banking system is very high. To control the fiscal deficit, severe austerity measures are placed in lots of countries. This disproportionately hits the south. This has disastrous implications on the countries like Greece, Spain and Italy. They are still feeling that hit. Only one country, albeit an important one, the founder partner of Eurozone has since left EU. Interest rates drop to zero. Risks and uncertainty remain extraordinarily high. Stocks float up only by the grace of extraordinary liquidity and Central Banking actions.\n\nWorld is a bleak place. Billions, even trillions of dollars are looking for home. A safe place for investment. A place where $100 invested can yield a 75 bps (0.75%) return, calls for a party, if not less.\n\nChina, the hegemonic prince is also feeling the pain. Its stellar growth is cut down by half, and dips to about 5%. Still good but is like a boxer punched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\n\nEnter India. By the magic of RBI Chairman YV Reddy, India manages to get away with few scratches in this global car crash. India for a short period thereon, has the world’s highest growth rate. Entire world looks to India to see if the government can follow through and give green signal for investments. A clue, an hint or just bloody anything positive from the government so that they can reroute some investments. Even a damn, “Teek hai”, would be enough. Mind you, trillions of $s are stuck in near-0 return or even negative returns - EVEN UNTIL TODAY.\n\nEnter, Manmohan Singh as PM. Finance minster is Pranab Mukerjee. Recently relelected, they have nothing to fear for another 4-5 years. They have clean slate, thanks to RBI Charimen YV Reddy, and followed up by Subba Rao. Inflation is largely under control. Crude oil is down below $50-60. Rupee largely in range. No huge corporate scams, except notably Satyam. NPA problems haven\'t cropped up yet. Real interest rates remain mind-bogglingly high, and kept high by inflation hawks Subba Rao, and later Rajaram, and Urjit Patel.\n\nGrowth rates are still at 7% +, the highest in the world. World watches with wonder and envy. China with it\'s possibly unreliable numbers is barely above 6%.\n\nPranab takes a first shot at ‘recovery.’ Announces a massive stimulus of 700 crores\\*, followed by some more steps. Peanuts! Corporate India is hopeful that this will be first of the many steps. Corporate India knows the possibilities, ready to take on the challenges, and get more FDIs in. Actually, they just have to lift a finger to get flood of FDIs. Alas, those other steps never come! Hopes are dashed.\n\nSo, what happened in 2009-2010 that caused this total destruction of opportunity? Scams. Series of scams. Unending streams of them. It starts with the unravelling of 2G spectrum, that will hold a death grip on the government till the end. Followed by shambolic Commonwealth Games scams. As if the scam wasn’t enough, the game organization was a PR disaster for India. The mega Coal scam was final nail in their coffin. There were far many more scams, from Nira Radia tapes, Waqf board, Bellary coal exports, Devas, Adarsh building. So many! Just look up. Lazy? [Here you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). The length of the list of these scams itself is a crying shame.\n\nEverything was at the High Command level, and Manmohan Singh just totally was lost in managing whatever it was that he was managing. Like a deer at the headlights, the inaction was very costly.\n\nHis cabinet was a "Den of thieves." Except the rare few, find me a good one [among these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Manmohan_Singh_ministry). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3\n\nThe golden opportunity of getting those billions of dollars in investments were squandered by the Congress. The opportunity and dream of getting to ‘Double Digit” growth rate was crushed.\n\nWhile Congress was reeling under revelation of scams, trying its best to malign Modi and BJP as distraction. Grumblings within Congress ensured that RG was the only way to keep the Congress within the family.\n\nFrom that ‘World’s favorite destination’, the poster-boy of growth, from the best of the BRIC — it was a mighty fall! \n\nThe growth/ developments were virtually stagnant through the entire second term of Manmohan Singh. Guess, who utilized that golden opportunity?\n\nLook at the below graph, a comparison with China and India, index to 100 starting at recession (2007).\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qPnt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qPnt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina                          India                             \n\n2008                              $4.5 trillion                $1.2 trillion                      \n\n2018                            $13.6 trillion              $2.7 trillion                     \n\nGrowth (times)                    3.0                              2.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChina beat India not only in the growth rate, but also importantly coming from a much higher base. That was a bitch slap on Indian faces. \n\nChina added *$9.1 trillion* to its GDP in 10 years, and India added measly *$1.5trillion* in the same period. In sum, China added 6 times of India’s GDP. In other words, for analogy, what China added to GDP in 10 years would take India 60 years! \n\nSuch huge was the loss of opportunity. Truly and utterly disgusting, and painful.\n\nAll because of a party, a coterie of people, who couldn’t think for the country beyond their own personal welfare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. \n\nWhy this, why now?  Why this rant, at this moment?\n\nIt\'s simple. Because we are back in the same spot. The same extraordinary opportunity awaits us. A new door has opened, and new era has possibly dawned. And, as before, only if, India has determination and fearlessness to grab it.\n\nCoronavirus is a bad incident. Many people have died, its sad. But this has reset an equation that had for the past 10 years been wholly biased towards China. The World is once again on the lookout for a place of investment, partnership, mutually assured, and sustainable growth. India has to step up to the plate and grab this opportunity. Not just because the opportunity presents itself but for the generations of aspirations present and future. Not just for the Indians, but also for the whole world which needs a true dharmic and democratic leadership.\n\nIt’s that time again. And this time too, I beg you - I literally beg you - Modi, Shah, Sitaram, and others, please don’t lose sight of the great things you can achieve. It will mean lots of sleepless nights for you, but your work can give peaceful nights for an entire country. Be fearless and grab these and more opportunities, with confidence knowing well that all the country is behind you in this endeavor.\n\n**Rise up and don’t stop till you reach your goal.**'<br />Author: 'live_mint'  id: 'g9fikv'<br />Score:67<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g9fikv/rant_rise_up_india_its_your_time_again/</li>

Let us take a look at all the available Google Ad settings and their implications. We will look at both, account level settings and campaign level settings in this post. To access them find “Settings” in the left hand side column and expand it by clicking on the small triangle next to it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/x66M7Wm)\n\n# Account Settings\n\nClick and open “Account Settings” and as the name suggests, you will find settings that will affect the entire account here. Let’s take a look at each:\n\n* Tracking: Tracking templates allow you to track exactly which campaign, ad group, ads or keywords led to generating traffic on your webpage. This is kind of an outdated method as we can basically do this simply by switching on “Auto -Tagging”. But in some cases you might still need to have a separate template, so [here](https://www.karooya.com/blog/google-ads-account-level-tracking-template/) is a guide going into more details about it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/SQeBWnF)\n* Auto-tagging: As discussed above, “Auto-tagging” will help identify which of your campaigns are generating traffic for your campaigns, ad groups, ads or keywords are generating traffic. Simply enable this setting and it should automatically add parameters to your final URLs that will do the same thing a tracking template does. [Reference](https://imgur.com/z18pziS)\n* Message Reporting: helped you track your message extensions. Please note, message extensions are no longer available, so you can ignore this for now. [Reference](https://imgur.com/mJ7ydKp)\n* Call Reporting: records the details of the calls that were either generated when someone clicks on the call extensions or on the phone number displayed on your website (you need to have call tracking implemented, more on that later). Switch it on to see when the call was made, how long it lasted and the area code of the caller. [Reference](https://imgur.com/9CWYDnR)\n* Inventory Type: This setting affects video campaigns. This will help you fine tune the content your video ads show up on. Expanded inventory would allow your ad to show up on most content but may exclude profanity, nudity or violence. Standard gets a bit more strict than expanded and Limited restricts the most. [Here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7515513?ctx=tltp) are more details about it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/KH399mS)\n* Exclude Content: This option will let you exclude websites that show extremely sensitive content. Excluding such websites will stop your display ads from not showing up on such websites. Opt out of showing ads on any content you don’t want to associate with your brand. [Reference](https://imgur.com/GWGLnhA)\n* Exclude types and labels: You may exclude your ads from showing up on content that might not fit your brand. Generally, opting out of content meant for mature audiences, content not yet labeled and parked domains is preferable. [Reference](https://imgur.com/PEmuxu6)\n* Ad Suggestions: Google will often suggest changes to your ads. You can either let Google implement them automatically or review and then implement them yourself. I prefer the later. [Reference](https://imgur.com/3f6lXhK)\n* Data protection contacts: This is mostly needed when you are serving ads to audiences in the EU and tracking sensitive user data. Just mention the contacts for your data protection officers here. [Reference](https://imgur.com/IPQM2vF)\n\n# Campaign Settings\n\nClick on “Campaign Settings” inside the “Settings” menu on the left. [Reference](https://imgur.com/A2GHk9h)\n\n* Goal: Here you can choose whether you want the campaign to drive more sales, leads or just drive traffic to your website. Setting a goal will allow Google to recommend settings and features to achieve that goal. Generally I select “No Goal Guidance” as I trust my judgement more but, if you want you should select the one that makes most sense to you. [Reference](https://imgur.com/IsiPfOx) and [Reference](https://imgur.com/DuCYGw1)\n* Networks: If this is purely a search campaign, make sure you are not including “Display network” as both the networks work differently and should always be kept separate. [Reference](https://imgur.com/j7p9LMK)\n* Locations: Here you can add or exclude locations to your campaigns. We have already seen how to do that in previous posts ([here](https://medium.com/@sngrmtawade/google-ads-editor-and-search-ads-learn-google-ads-basics-a35197134f23) and [here](https://medium.com/@sngrmtawade/create-a-display-campaign-learn-google-ads-basics-b58f801a7526))**.** Let’s take a quick look at the various location options available here. Under “Target” there are three options available: a) People in, or who show interest in, your targeted locations, b) People in or regularly in your targeted locations and c) People searching for your targeted locations. Now, you will see that Google is recommending the first option. But read it carefully, it is very deceptive. It lets you target people in or who show interest in your location. Only choose this option if you know that people outside your target location may be interested in searching for your services (eg. hotels, restaurants). But be careful as ads will show up even in other countries as well. For most cases I’d recommend choosing the second option as it won’t show your ads outside your target area. Never select the third one as it will show ads only to people searching for your target location. Under “Exclude” there are two options: a) People in your target location and b) People in, or who show interest in, your excluded locations. Always select the first one as it is less restrictive. [Reference](https://imgur.com/IGprLeN)\n* Language and budget we have already covered earlier, so I won’t get into it again and bidding I will go into greater details further in this post. [Reference](https://imgur.com/cL3tLpo)\n* Start and end date: Here you can add the end date for your campaign so that it automatically stops serving ads on that day. You can even add a start date to a campaign when you create it so that it starts running only on that future date. [Reference](https://imgur.com/viFcF7m)\n* Conversions: This lets you choose the conversion actions you want Google to focus on for this campaign. Of course you need to first start tracking conversions (more on that later). [Reference](https://imgur.com/uvUB3oP)\n* Ad Rotation: Now, while this does show you four options, only two are available for you to choose from for new campaigns. a) Optimize: Prefer best performing ads — Only the best performing ads in an ad group are shown more often. b) Do not optimize: Rotate ads indefinitely — This lets you show all ads in an ad group more evenly. I usually prefer choosing the second option and let the searchers decide which they feel is the best. [Reference](https://imgur.com/rxgFIXO)\n* Campaign URL Options: If you wanted to assign custom tracking templates to a particular campaign, this is where you’d do it (we saw tracking templates earlier)\n* Dynamic Search Ads Settings: If you are using [dynamic search ads](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3249700?hl=en), you’ll be able to choose its settings here. I’d recommend against using\n* IP Exclusions: Here you can exclude certain IP’s so that ads do not show up on them. It is a good idea to exclude your IP so that the ads don’t show up when you or your employees try to get to your website (you don’t want to waste impressions and clicks on yourself). [Reference](https://imgur.com/Y1umtRF)\n\n# Bidding Strategies\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the various bidding options Google offers us. We will understand what each option is, when to use it and what are the general precautions you should take while choosing one. Reference\n\n# Manual CPC\n\nThis is the bidding strategy where you assign a bid to each keyword. This strategy requires a more hands on approach to bidding as you will be the one increasing or decreasing the bids as need arises. Generally, I start a campaign with this bidding strategy and assign bids to each keyword with the aim of reaching the top of the SERP page. As time passes I gradually reduce the bids without sacrificing the top position.\n\nYou retain all the control and ensure that CPC’s don’t end up being too high.But, you have to do all the work, you adjust the bids manually. This may end up taking up a lot of time. We often don’t know all the information for an auction that Google’s automated bidding systems know. So we may just end up wasting money on an clicks that won’t always convert.\n\n# Enhanced CPC\n\nEnhanced CPC works mostly just like Manual CPC but with a small layer of automation added on top. To activate Enhanced CPC you have to choose Manual CPC as the bidding option and ensure that you are selecting it as shown [here](https://imgur.com/huEdfAs). \n\nThis strategy will adjust your bids for you when Google thinks a conversion is likely to happen. Again. Start with just manual bidding so that you let Google gather some conversion data (ideally a conversion a day for the last 30 days or so) and then move on to this strategy.\n\nThis is a slightly more cautious approach to automated bidding than the rest of the strategies as you still retain a good amount of control over your bids. But then again there is always a chance that your average CPC is higher than anticipated and it might not be too profitable.\n\n# Target CPA\n\nBy using this strategy Google automatically bids on your keywords and tries to attain the “Target CPA” (Cost per Acquisition or Cost per Lead or Cost per Conversion) that you have set. [Reference](https://imgur.com/nuIgGgQ)\n\n This strategy works great if you have been consistently getting a good amount of conversions for a suitable cost per acquisition. So again, for this bidding strategy it is good to have some conversion data before through manual bidding before switching over. Ideally have at least a conversion a day for the last 30 days. Always remember to set realistic goals at the start of the campaign. Don’t expect conversions to happen at ₹1 if the bid itself is ₹100.\n\n# Target ROAS\n\nMuch like Target CPA, this strategy will set bids automatically and will help you maximize your conversion value (more on that coming up). [Reference](https://imgur.com/IIXFZie)\n\nJust make sure your campaigns have historic conversion and conversion data available (for 30 days at least) and then switch over to this. With this one, be careful not to be too restrictive with your target ROAS as it might just end up ruining your campaign.\n\n# Maximize Clicks\n\nThis strategy will get you as many clicks as possible for your budget. [Reference](https://imgur.com/BkdBEH7)\n\nThis can be a great strategy if you are trying to generate traffic for your website but not so much when you are focused on conversions. There is no guarantee that the people who land on your website might be interested in purchasing your products or services. Always remember to add a Maximum CPC bid limit else your average CPC might end up being higher than desired.\n\n# Maximize Conversions\n\nThis is the strategy I end up using the most after manual bidding. [Reference](https://imgur.com/BZDUlJo)\n\nTo put it simply, this strategy will bid on your keywords only when a conversion for you is likely. Of course, you should again have conversion data for this to work effectively. But when everything is in place, there is no better strategy to drive conversions for your campaigns than this one.\n\n# Maximize Conversion Value\n\nAgain, much like maxima conversions, this will maximize the value of your conversions. [Reference](https://imgur.com/9eavCyH)\n\nGoogle sets bids to help you get the value for your conversions with your set budget. This again works great if conversion value is your target but again will require a good amount of data before you can successfully use it.\n\n# Target Impression Share\n\nThis strategy will help increase the chances of your ad appearing on the search results page. You have the option to help make the ad appear anywhere on the page, on top of the search results page or the absolute top of the page. [Reference](https://imgur.com/76ZrxUA)\n\nThis would mean that the ad would show 50% of the time at top of the the results page.Again, remember to have a max CPC limit here and make sure it is not too restrictive. This is a good strategy for increasing awareness, but not so much for conversions.\n\nThat’s all for account and campaign settings and bid strategies. Next, we will take a look at connecting Google Ads to Google Analytics and tracking conversions.'<br />Author: 'bhelpuri13'  id: 'g9cj8k'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g9cj8k/learn_something_new_google_ads_part_7/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Assemble-in-India? Maybe. Develop-in-India? Probably not and this is another example why'<br />Body: 'So I was reading this article about how BSNL has put out a tender for 4G equipment and how innovation in India will never happen since procurement is always done in such a way to exclude Indian players.\n\n [https://the-ken.com/story/bsnls-rs-8000-crore-tender-make-for-india-not-make-in-india/#\\_=\\_](https://the-ken.com/story/bsnls-rs-8000-crore-tender-make-for-india-not-make-in-india/#_=_) \n\n ***BSNL’s Rs 8,000 crore tender—Make for India, not Make in India***\n\nI will highlight the major points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The state-backed telecom operator has invited bids for its Rs 8,000 crore (\\~$1 billion) 4G network build-out and expansion. The budget comes out of the Rs 69,000 crore (\\~$9 billion) revival plan the Indian government cobbled together last year after deciding to keep the telco alive for reasons of national security and self-reliance. \n\nAs yes, the BSNL bailout. Remember that? Rs 69,000 crore to pay for VRS salaries and to prop up another blood-sucking PSU. All bankrolled by Vodafone and Airtel? Maybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Telecom executives estimate that BSNL’s 4G rollout will eventually cost India Rs 25,000 crore-30,000 crore\xa0 ($3.2 billion-3.9 billion) over the next three-to-four years, including the annual maintenance cost. The 4G network will have to be upgraded to 5G in a few years as well.  \n\nFabulous use of money. Now to the Rs 8000 crore tender. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 1** \n\n the BSNL tender document itself cost Rs 6 lakh ($7,861). The earnest money deposit is Rs 70 crore (\\~$9.1 million). Little surprise that small and medium companies are baulking at even buying the tender document. \n\n**Step 2** \n\n BSNL’s ask for an end-to-end system in 4G is a non-starter for Indian companies \n\n**Step 3** \n\nDemands such as prior experience of millions of telecommunications lines installed, or having millions of subscribers in at least two countries, are restrictive enough to exclude virtually every Indian telecom equipment manufacturer. As it is, the industry is dominated by large multinationals: the ratio of imports to exports is 10:1 in the country. What takes the cake, though, is BSNL’s requirement of turnover\n\n“The bidder shall be a company having a minimum turnover of Rs 8,000 crore each in the last two years.”\n\nIt appears BSNL, on a lark, decided to say, ‘I am rolling out a Rs 8,000 crore network, so we will have a Rs 8000 turnover limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***So does BSNL really want to give our money to?***\n\n “That’s because the tender has been cooked up by the incumbents—ZTE and Nokia—which have been suppliers to BSNL,” says the CEO quoted above \n\n Secondly, BSNL owes Rs 3,000 crore (\\~$393 million) to Nokia and Rs 1,800 crore (\\~$235 million) to ZTE. So, if the framing of its 4G specs was guided by these vendors, as has been alleged, it’s not hard to understand why. \n\n***And who will win?***\n\n The way it is structured, claim some multinational telecoms executives, ZTE will emerge as the lowest tender, while Nokia will likely be the next lowest. ITI Limited, the Bengaluru-based public sector undertaking (PSU), will follow. “The tender reserves one zone to be given to ITI,” says an executive with a European telecoms manufacturer. “But they are a trader organisation, they buy equipment from one OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and supply it to the government.” \n\n***But you might ask why give it to Indians who cannot make 4G?***\n\n If you map the 4G-to-5G tech landscape, there is adequate competence and capability in the Indian industry, says a radio equipment manufacturer in Bengaluru. “But they don’t have the wherewithal to manufacture it.”\n\nTo an audience of seven secretary-level bureaucrats in late December, the group of industry players mentioned earlier presented a case where they argued that with about $1 billion in committed R&amp;D funds and some business security, they’d build a 5G ecosystem in 18-20 months.\xa0\n\n***How did China, Korea make 5G?***\n\n This is exemplified by China’s Huawei, ZTE, and Korea’s Samsung, where apart from guaranteed domestic contracts, companies get financing to expand their business in other countries.\xa0 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Is there any government support?***\n\nIn telecom and electronics manufacturing, startups have had to fight for every tender. “We make representations, they get swept under the carpet,” says Rajesh Tuli, founder of Coral Telecom, a Noida-based communications technology company. “This is how it is across all ministries, from electronics to IT, railways to defence.”\n\nTo cite an example, under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s (MeitY) rules, the intercom system and related products, IP PBX, are reserved 100% for local companies. The first comprehensive policy on preferential market access came in 2011-2012. “Still, most government organisations have been buying only Cisco, including the National Informatics...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe article goes into a lot more details but this is the gist. Forget exports, India has so much internal demand that that along can push innovation. But does even the govt buy Indian?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are so many examples. Defense is filled with it, amazing products no buyers. Think of the Train-18, scrapped with new tendering again (which will exclude Indian players).\n\nGreat example is the mindset of ICMR today, import cheapest Chinese Junk at L1 prices.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'g90nhl'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g90nhl/assembleinindia_maybe_developinindia_probably_not/</li>

Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result. O son of Prtha, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the bondage of works.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nAccording to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saṅkhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and saṅkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna's proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. Kṛṣṇa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as sāṅkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila's sāṅkhya, the sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puruṣa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakṛti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gītā. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakṛti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of māyā or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.\n\nArjuna has already accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam. Consequently, Kṛṣṇa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramātmā in everyone's heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\n\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sāṅkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic sāṅkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Kṛṣṇa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real sāṅkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but even that sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, sāṅkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kṛṣṇa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa's sāṅkhya and Lord Kapila's sāṅkhya, as described in the Bhāgavatam; are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sāṅkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.\n\nOf course, atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gītā.\n\nOne should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.\n\n**Question 1 : What is sāṅkhya philosophy ? Who gave the real sāṅkhya philosophy ? What are the principles mentioned in it ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is buddhi-yoga ? Why one should act according the principles of buddhi-yoga ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 2: Contents of the Gita Summarized](https://preview.redd.it/n64303h8u9v41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba755191b2e32782c3527e7b451997b006e41df)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g8ruwf'<br />Score:17<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g8ruwf/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_239/</li>

If they yield influence over international bodies like WHO, then they have control over the international narrative, just as they have domestically. \n\n**But that's not what we see today.** We see an increasing number of people across the world directing their hatred not just towards the CCP, but ethnic Chinese who live overseas. And as China asserts more influence over govts all over the world, the hatred will probably grow more intense. \n\nThe biggest lesson that India can learn from this is, **DO NOT strive to be exceptional compared to the rest of the world.** Because of its population and growth rate, India will follow a similar trajectory as China. At some point, this will cause India to have a lot of critics and enemies. **I believe that its important for India not to talk about becoming No. 1 at anything, and also constantly show its failures and weaknesses to the rest of the world.** That way, the global populace will have less fear about India and Indians in general."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'g8rohx'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g8rohx/what_can_india_learn_from_china_in_relation_to/</li>

With all-out attempts by central banks and tax regulators to mitigate the blow, equity prices in developed economies have tanked and money has been flowing out at an unprecedented pace from emerging markets. A severe economic recession is likely, as is the financial crisis. The biggest questions today are how serious and how long the crisis will last.\n\nThe developing countries that constitute two-thirds of the world’s population are encountering and expecting an economic slowdown that is never seen for long. To avert and curb the outspread and consequent damages, the UN is pushing for an aid package of USD 2.5 trillion for such nations. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), has published an analysis on 30 March 2020 under the topic ‘The COVID-19 Shock to Developing Countries: Towards a “*whatever it takes*” program for two-thirds of the world’s population to being left behind’, in which it is predicted that most of the exporting countries will see a USD 2 – 3 trillion declines in investment from overseas in coming years, which will further lead to the GDP going down. UNCTAD also said that in recent days, emerging economies and China have put together large policy packages that would provide a USD 5 trillion lifeline to their economies according to the Group of 20 leading economies (G20).\n\nInformation that March marked the beginning of a deep global recession is mounting. The extent of the downturn is starting to emerge in the initial drip of worldwide economic results, showing a trade cratering, reined-in corporate spending, cowering customers, and rising unemployment, which spares few sectors. The phenomenal impact on global trade through the ocean is also very apparent. The containers are dwelling at the transit points and ports unable to move from the manufacturing origin to the sale destination. As per the IHS Markit study compiled by Bloomberg, the U.S. export volumes in the first two full weeks of March showed shipments abroad at less than half the year-earlier level. The automobile market and trade are badly hit with the spare parts and raw materials that are sourced from one country not reaching the manufacturing plants in another. As per another Bloomberg data, 19% of the fleet of ships that used to transport vehicles are anchored without any movement as per March data which is only expected to increase.\n\nCoronavirus lockdowns have closed industries from India to Italy and left billions of people homebound for weeks, triggering a concurrent supply and demand scare that is snarled global manufacturing and distribution networks designed without the adequate capability to withstand a shock of this scale. Even though the lockout may have been appropriate to restrict the spread of coronavirus, as others have believed, this does not fix the issue. It simply offers the government with some leeway to manufacture and deliver more test kits, raise test levels, speed up the availability of ventilators, and, among other items, ensure the health of medical personnel. The shutdown can just delay the issue without such steps.\n\nFor at least 21 days, the main part of the non-agricultural population would have no employment. There would be a significant rise in violence, in the absence of major public action. This lockdown also affects production. The dramatic production and distribution curtailment means all manner of shortages will arise fairly soon. Consumption demand, the Indian economy’s backbone, will also slip as sales crashes, and private investors will be rattled and unsure. Many independent businesses would even be wiped out.\n\nThe $23-billion budget revealed on March 26 by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is so low it’s disappointing. Often the outlandish-named “PM Gareeb Kalyan Scheme” is a modification of certain advantages of current schemes. The increased investment introduced in this plan will only amount to about 0.5 percent of the projected GDP — a marginal boost that would do little to stop the economy’s free fall. Compare it to other governments and more to come who have announced relief and investment programs of somewhere from 5-10 percent of GDP.'<br />Author: 'backlinkcreator'  id: 'g8lqgd'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g8lqgd/impact_on_the_indian_economy_due_to_cornacovid_19/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Slave trade and the Ottoman empire'<br />Body: 'All of the quotes are from Thomas Sowell\'s wonderful book -- "Black Rednecks and White Liberals". I cannot recommend high enough any of this great thinker\'s books. It is relevant to India since the Ottoman empire is held in high regard by many Muslims in India and around the world. All of these quotes are sourced further by Dr. Sowell in his book, in case anyone wants to look at the original sourcing of these.\n\nLet\'s begin:\n\n(1) The Ottoman Empire regularly enslaved a percentage of the young boys from the Balkans, converted them to Islam and assigned them to various duties in the civil or military establishment.\n\n----\n\n(2)The British government pressured the Ottoman Empire into banning the African slave trade and, later, threatened to start boarding Ottoman ships in the Mediterranean if that empire did not do a better job of policing the ban.\n\n----\n\n(3)When the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire first raised the issue of abolishing slavery with the sultan in 1840, he reported this response:\n\n...I have been heard with extreme astonishment accompanied with a smile at a proposition for destroying an institution closely inter-woven with the frame of society in this country, and intimately connected with the law and with the habits and even the religion of all classes, from the Sultan himself on down to the lowest peasant.\n\n----\n\n(4)Here was the scene when the Ottoman Empire announced the end of\nthe slave trade:\n\nIn 1855, when the Sultan’s firman was read out in Mecca and Jedda, it caused a revolution. Turkish officials, including the kadi who read the firman, were murdered, the garrison shut, and Mecca was in a state of revolt until the Porte repealed the obnoxious order.... And when the Governor-General of the Hedjaz issued orders on 25 February 1860, forbidding the slave trade in all Turkish ports in the Red Sea, there was great excitement and fear of the recurrence of the 1855 violence. There was no Ottoman cruiser in the Red Sea capable of giving effect to this order, and Turkish officials were too frightened to enforce it.\n\n----\n\n(5)Although the slave trade was formally abolished in the Ottoman Empire, under pressure from the British government, slavery itself continued. As of 1891, the imperial palace purchased eleven slave girls for its harem, as others in the Ottoman Empire purchased women as concubines—typically white women from a region near the Caucasus and the Black Sea known as Circassia even though every nation in the Western world had by then\noutlawed slavery.\n\n----\n\n(6)A horror of becoming a slave has been widespread around the world, but this is wholly different from a reluctance to enslave others. Christians, Moslems, and Jews all forbad the enslavement of their own respective fellow religionists—though they did not always honor even this ban—but all considered it permissible to enslave others.\n\n----\n\n(7)Yet attempts to abolish slavery in the non-Western world provoked armed uprisings within the Ottoman Empire, and elsewhere peoples unable to\ndirectly mount challenges on the battlefield nevertheless engaged in massive evasions and concealments of their continued trade in human beings. After the open slave market in Istanbul was shut down, slaves continued to be smuggled in, often at night and in small groups, from the Caucasus and from around the Black Sea, among other places. Suppressing the slave trade across the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea was much harder and took much longer than suppressing the Atlantic slave trade. While slaves were trans-\nported across the Atlantic in large ships packed with their human cargoes, slaves were carried in smaller and more numerous vessels, along with rice, fish, and other merchandise, from East Africa to the Islamic world.\n\n----\n\n(8)British naval patrols were overwhelmed by the task of sorting out which of the innumerable Arab vessels were carrying slaves at a given time and place, and these patrols were never able to intercept more than a fraction of the slaves being shipped out of East Africa to the Islamic world of the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n----\n\n(9)Slaves who could not keep up with the caravans were abandoned in the desert and left to die a lingering death from heat, thirst and hunger. Thousands of human skeletons were strewn along one Saharan slave\nroute alone—mostly the skeletons of young women and girls, who were more in demand than men in much of the Islamic world.  These skeletons tended to cluster in the vicinity of wells, suggesting their last desperate efforts to reach water. A letter from an Ottoman official in 1849 referred to 1,600 black slaves dying of thirst on their way to Libya. It has been estimated that, for every slave to reach Cairo alive, several died on the way. Whether or not the survivors were later treated better or worse than slaves in the Western Hemisphere, after reaching their final destinations, is by no means the whole story.\n\n----\n\n(10)For example, this was the scene in eighteenth-century Algiers as newly captured European slaves were paraded through town:\nSince the arrival of new slaves was a sign of prosperity and an occasion of civic pride for all the townsfolk, the resident Turks, Moors, Jews, and renegades all turned out to cheer and taunt the newcomers. Local children especially followed the slaves as they shuffled along, loudly humiliating them and sometimes threw refuse at them.'<br />Author: 'iisdumb'  id: 'g8cjo2'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g8cjo2/slave_trade_and_the_ottoman_empire/</li>

There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of Kṛṣṇa is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities. It is said:  \n\n\ndevarṣi-bhutāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṝṇāṁ  \nna kiṅkaro nāyamṛṇī ca rājan  \nsarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁ  \ngato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kartam  \n\n\n(Bhag. 11.5.41)  \n\n\n"Anyone who has completely surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa, Mukunda, giving up all other duties, is no longer a debtor, nor is he obliged to anyone-not the demigods, nor the sages, nor the people in general, nor kinsmen, nor humanity, nor forefathers." That is the indirect hint given by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses.  \n\n\n**Question 1 : What are the benefits of performing activities in Krishna consciousness ?**  \n\n\n**Question 2 : FITB : Lord Kṛṣṇa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting because\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 62yv0jbve3v41...*\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g88d6c'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g88d6c/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_238/</li>

Nearly 150 Rakhine porters drawn from various villages of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh and accompanied by 50 fighters of Arakan Army carried this consignment on foot and mules through Gundum and Rejupara, Uhalapalonh and Paglirara crisscrossing the very hilly border region.\xa0 Skirting the Matamuhuri-Sangua wildlife sanctuary, the column skirted Singpa and reached the Arakan Army camp at Sandak(Mro) near Thanchi on March 2.\n\n\n&gt;After carrying the huge consignment to Sandak(Mro), the AA has smuggled the arms into Rakhine using the Parva corridor in South Mizoram where the local Khumi villagers are friendly to the insurgents.\n\n\n&gt;The Assam Rifles which guards this frontier has thin deployment in the Parva area because Mizoram is a peaceful state and there is no local insurgency. So after mobilising additional troops for ‘Operation Sunrise’ in which some AA bases in South Mizoram were demolished, the Assam Rifles had to pull back most of them for deployment in other insurgency affected states of Northeast India.\n\n\n&gt; The TCL connection has earlier figured in a successful NIA case investigating an attempt by the rebels of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland(Issam-Muivah) to bring in a huge consignment of weapons by the same Monakhali-Wyakaung route in 2010. NIA arrested NSCN ‘chief of procurement’ Anthony alias Nikkhang Shimray and secured the extradition of Chinese-Thai descent arms smuggler Willy Naruenartwanich alias Willy Narue to stand trial in India.\n\n\n&gt; But under pressure from NSCN(I-M) whose negotiations with the Indian government is now in its final stages, Delhi released Shimray, who had been earlier been picked by Indian intelligence at Kathmandu airport and booked under NSA.\xa0 Willy also had to be let off and the case practically closed down.\n\n\n&gt; The AA rebels now seem to be using the same route inside Bangladesh (Wyakaung beach to Thanchi to Parva in Mizoram) that the northeastern rebels have used before.\n\n#Read the full article here : https://nenow.in/neighbour/bangladesh/chinese-weapons-for-arakan-army-through-bangladesh.html'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'g87wr5'<br />Score:21<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g87wr5/chinese_weapons_for_arakan_army_through_bangladesh/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'An analysis of the ideological deficiencies of Hindus'<br />Body: "They attack Hinduism. You attack Pakistan.  \n\nThey fight for Islamic cause. You fight for Nationalist cause.  \n\nThey want Sharia state. You want truly secular state.  \n\nThey fight religious wars. You fight political wars. \n\nIn simpler terms if Hindu cause is +X and Muslim cause is -X then they fight for -X and you fight for 0. \n\nSome Hindu nationalists say that they hate Muslims because they aren't loyal to the country. Well, even if they were loyal, what good would that do for us ? The country is already highly biased towards them so it's their advantage only. \n\nSince you fight for true secularism, you also equate both the radicals and speak against both of them. In the end you only help your enemies as their people don't oppose their type of radicalism. (And you're left questioning why when the answer is clear.)\n\nThey don't raise voices for KPs but when you do, you also include Sufis and Balochis with them to monkey balance. They speak for Junaid and Akhlaq only (and all other lynched Muslims) while you speak for Gaurakshak Gopal and soldier Aurangzeb in the same breath. \n\nYou rename Aurangzeb road to Kalam road while they rename Rampur to Rahimpur. You only speak against the radicalism in their community while they straight up abuse your religion and Gods. They want the right to abuse your religion while you want the right to abuse all religions. \n\nThe flag of Pakistan is fully Islamic while the flag of India is only a third Hindu. As SitaRam Goel ji said, Pakistan is fixed deposit while India is a joint account. There are negligible Hindus in Pakistan while Muslims are around a sixth of the population in India.\n\nThey feel proud that they made Hindus go from 13 % to 2 % in 7 decades while you feel proud that they increased to 15 % from 9 % in the same time. You feel proud of even the small number of Muslim achievers &amp; worship them while they don\\`t let Hindus even get the opportunity.\n\nAnother thing Hindus need to learn is to actually start making enemy accusations of being intolerant, bigoted, fundamentalist and radicals true. There is nothing wrong in being any of these. Don't take guilt over Babri demolition or Godhra riots, instead take pride.\n\nThey talk of atrocities on Muslims in Kashmir. You talk of atrocities of Pakistan in Balochistan. In both cases, someone is talking for Muslims while no one cares for the original Hindu natives of Balochistan and Kashmir. Who is the ultimate winner in both the cases?\n\nOn social media you see two types of Muslims : the Hindu hating radical &amp; the Hinduism praising moderate. Actually both work for Islam in different ways. The radical is simply abusing your religion &amp; the moderate is keeping you calm &amp; making you feel proud on being a secular. \n\nUltimately the winner is Islam as the radical is doing the -X part but the moderate guy is preventing you from doing the +X part. Ask every moderate Muslim whether he will do Ghar Wapsi. If he answers yes then make him do so and if he says no then stay away from him. \n\nThe answer to Allahu Akbar is Jay Shree Ram not Hum Sab Ek Hai.  \n\nThe answer to Dar-ul-Islam is Hindu Rashtra not a Secular State.  \n\nThe answer to Quran is Vedas not Constitution. \n\nThe answer to Islam is Hinduism not secularism. \n\nCredit -  https://twitter.com/T\\_1000\\_\\_/status/1252971699856986114?s=20"<br />Author: 'Loweowe'  id: 'g87vle'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g87vle/an_analysis_of_the_ideological_deficiencies_of/</li>

      <li>Title::: "On the occasion of Parsuram Jayanti. Let's make some thing clear."<br />Body: 'Since many years I am seeing the usage of the word "evil" in context of our festivals, like Happy Diwali, the victory of good over evil or Parsuram destroyed "evil" from earth 21 times and I have a problem with that.\n\n\nI have a problem with the word "evil". There is nothing called "evil" in Hindu philosophy or any Indian philosophy. There is Dharma and Adharma and even then Adharma can\'t be equated with evil. \nLook at our stories. In Ramayana, after striking Raavan with the killer arrow, Lord Ram asks Lakshman to go to  Raavan to learn life lessons. You see, this is a very small detail and yet a profound one. Lord Ram didn\'t demonize Raavan. He knew that Raavan was a learned man and infact was a very benevolent King. It\'s just that with all that knowledge he possessed his ego knew no bounds and that\'s why he did what he did, that he chose Adharma over Dharma. Laxman, revolted at the idea at first but didn\'t have heart to disobey lord Ram and went to see Raavan to take some life lessons. Raavan breathing his last breaths, instead of hating his enemy in front of him, accepted him heartedly and taught him a few lessons.  \n\nThe whole saga is an epitome of human maturity in conflicting times. Even being his enemy, Lord Ram didn\'t hate Raavan. He didn\'t demonize him.  \n\nYou see, this whole demonization of the opposition is pretty recent in Indian history. Indian consciousness was always matured enough to see the circumstances playing the role in one\'s life to have made poor decisions. And when circumstances can\'t be blamed, it\'s always vices in that person to be blamed like huge ego, insatiable greed or lust etc like in case of Duryodhan.  \n\nMahabharata is an another epic of this country and even in it, Duryodhan, the villainous Kaurav prince isn\'t demonized. There are many a times , Yudhisthir, the Pandava prince, was asked what he thinks about Duryodhana and every time Yudhisthir just picks out his vices like he is driven by jealousy or he is mad in power or something like that but never once in the whole epic he demonized Duryodhana and branded him evil. \n\nNow, what difference does this make? When you demonize someone, the possibility of resolving a conflict by having a dialogue ends. Both of our epics have emphasized in resolving a conflict by having a reasonable dialogue with your enemy. Lord Ram, repeatedly sent his ambassadors to Raavan to avoid the conflict by releasing Sita and Pandavas requested many times to Duryodhana to have their rightly deserved kingdom hand over to them. They even made amendments in their demands and we\'re ready to even settle for only 5 provinces(one for each brother). In both cases, when reasons failed, wars were inevitable.  \n\nThese are telling of reasonable human approach and I am sure if you look into other stories of  Indian philosophy, you will find many other instances of the same. But when this "evil" buisness comes in, all reason goes to hell(pun intended). I am good, opposition is evil. And who decided that I am good and the opposition is evil?

      <li>Title::: 'Pazhassi Raja - The Lion of Kerala #4'<br />Body: '# Second revolt and death (1800–1805)\n\nAfter the fall of Tipu, Wayanad fell to the British. They sent a Mysore Commission to seize Wayanad and planned to annexe it to either Canara or Coimbatore. But as Wayanad was a traditional possession of Kottayam Raja Ji and that Pazhassi is in control of this region since 1793, Pazhassi correctly saw move was an encroachment on his country’s ancient provinces. Raja Ji retaliated by collecting a large force of Nayars Warriors.\n\nBritish Government at Madras appointed Major General Arthur Wellesley as British army commandant of Mysore, Canara &amp; Malabar- **He planned to surround Raja Ji by attacking from double side i.e. from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad** and began preparations for that end. Raja Ji observed the Major General’s move- The general had brought reinforcements and building roads in Wayanad and outposts across rebel country. In response, Raja Ji also recruited numerous men, which alarmed Wellesley so much that he even wanted to kidnap kith and kin of rebels to stop Raja Ji’s recruitment.\n\nRaja Ji learnt that Wellesley had left to Deccan on a military mission-Raja Ji who understood that Major General’s absence is a great chance swiftly made his move. **He marched across Kuttiyadi Pass and below he made a junction with several great nobles like Kampuratt Nambiar of Iruvazhinad, Peruvayal Nambiar and Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar.**\n\nBy monsoon of 1800, rebels who controlled all of country-side of Kottayam threatened to overwhelm British outposts in Kottayam. Wellesley sent a large force under Colonel Sartorius to recapture British rebel-held Kottayam. But the plan could not be carried out as there were not enough British troops in Malabar. Wellesley advised Commissioners to stop all communications and transportation with Wayanad to starve Raja Ji of supplies. But the shortage of troops also meant this plan too remained on paper. By the time, Wellesley started to move ahead with his initial plan and decided to smash Raja Ji by a double drive from Malabar Coast and Mysore into Wayanad. The Nobels of neighbour kingdoms agreed to support of Raja Ji.\n\n**By 1801, a large British force of over 10,000 men swarmed all over Kottayam and Wayanad** and they blocked all passes that linked Wayanad with Malabar. Before so large numbers, rebels thought wise to go under-ground for time being. Raja Ji also found that he could no longer contact his supporters in Southern Wayanad and Southern Malabar. Raja Ji became a wanderer in forests but even then, to surprise of British, he ruled out compromise it seems he understood that there was no alternative to full freedom.\n\nRaja Ji had six close aides and 25 musketeers in his wanderings. First, he went north via Payyavur along montane forests of eastern Chirakkal to rally support. But British were on his trail but failed to catch him. Raja Ji then visited his secret bases in Kottayam and then moved into Kadathanad and jungles of Kurumbranad. British were angered that where ever he went, nobles supported him in secret and decided to punish the nobles along with common folks for their help to rebel Raja Ji.\n\n**As a part of this oppression and terrorization, Peruvayal Nambiar was arrested by the British and was hanged.** British also threatened brutal penalty and confiscation of property for all those rebels who failed to surrender in six weeks. But a pardon was also issued for surrendered rebels. But none of these threats and temptations worked and Raja Ji was still at large. But some of his chief supporters were arrested of whom Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar was most famous. **Kannavath Sankaran Nambiar and his son were hanged too and their property was confiscated.**\n\nFollowing the murder of Kannavath Nambiar, a deceptive calm descended on North Malabar-calm before the storm. Collector Major MacLeod believed that war was over and went ahead with the exploitation program. He immediately declared total disarmament of Malabar and threatened those who kept arms with the death penalty. He also doubled the rate of tax and ordered a reassessment of tax of whole Malabar in a mere forty days.\n\nAll these \'reforms\' paid back in 1803 when Malabar was on verge of revolt as people were pushed to the wall. MacLeod tried to calm this with corrective measure-He cancelled all his \'reforms\' and old system was reinstated. But it was too late for Wayanad where Raja Ji’s men were prepared for a rebellion.\n\n# The Capture of Panamaram Fort\n\nThe first major event of the second revolt was the capture of Panamaram Fort. Edachena Kungan Nair planned the operation and was helped by 150 Kurichia bowmen under Talakkal Chandu. Fort had 70 men under Captain Dickenson and there was a large force of 360 men under Major Drummond only a few miles away in Pulinjali. So if Major came to help Captain in time Kurichia the Rebel forces would be overwhelmed by numbers. But Kungan and Chandu decided to take the risk. **The whole garrison was slaughtered in the surprise attack led by the two brave warriors and they lost only 5 dead and 10 wounded. Dickenson himself was killed. Rebels got 112 muskets, six boxes of ammunition and 6000 rupees. They also destroyed the whole fort.**\n\nWellesley was enraged at this rebel audacity and dispatched 500 men to retaliate. But by then rebel victory had roused all of Wayanad and Kottayam. Edachena Kungan, the hero of Panamaram success, went to Pulpally shrine and issued a proclamation to people to join Raja Ji’s war. 3000 men volunteered. They were posted at Valliyurkav and Edappally and 100 of them under the brother of Kungan posted themselves at Periya Pass and 25 men were posted at Kottiyur Pass. Rebel outposts were set up en route from Dindimal to Valliyurkav. The rebel army was mostly composed of archers and swordsmen, but some had muskets.\n\nEdachena Kungan Nambiar led an attack on a British detachment headed from Mysore to Mananthavadi. The harassment began once this force entered Wayanad till it reached a stream between Manathavadi and Bhavully river. There they were blocked by a rebel force entrenched on the opposite side of the stream. But to ill-luck of the rebels, a reinforcement which had caught up with blocked British army outflanked the rebel entrenchment and took a large number of prisoners. All these prisoners were disarmed and marched to a road where they were murdered.\n\n**Besides, British reinforcements arrived in Wayanad from all directions. But they could find Raja Ji and rebels anywhere. The rebels had moved to Kottayam.**\n\nIn 1802, they raided a supplies convoy near Kottiyur. British were frustrated by Kottayam people’s total lack of co-operation. To add to their trouble, in 1803, a rebel force took to field in Kurumbranad &amp; Payyormala and people were sympathetic to rebels. Kungan marched towards Pazhassi to wipe out the British outpost there but had to retreat, though the British suffered serious losses. Soon rebellion spread into Chirakkal where armed bands of partisans launched operations and often fought British openly. Raja Ji’s army by end of 1803 was ranging as far as Kannur and Thalasseri.\n\nIn March 1803, a rebel force marched as far as Calicut and captured Sub-Jail where they killed all guards and seized their firearms and ammunition. They also released prisoners, many of whom joined ranks of the rebel army. This was too much for MacLeod and he resigned immediately after this event.\n\nIn 1803, Wellesley left for Europe, after three years of inconclusive war with Pazhassi Raja Ji, later destined to become Duke of Wellington, vanquisher of Napoleon at Waterloo.\n\nIn 1804, a large British army arrived and 1200 Kolkar were also ready for action. Most importantly **Thomas Hervey Baber, a cunning man was appointed as Sub-Collector. It was he who crushed Pazhassi\'s Revolt forever.** It is indeed ironic that what a military genius like Wellesley could not attain, was achieved by Baber – said to be just a \'civil servant.\' Baber had both a personal motive – to avenge the death of his friend Major Cameron, the first husband of his wife Helen Somerville Fearon at the hand of Pazhassi Raja Ji on 9 January 1797 at Periya Pass. Baber became a civil servant to protect the interests of a small but influential group of merchants that included his in-laws – the Inglis and Money families of Bombay.\n\nIn 1804, a huge rising led by Kalyat Nambiar and Raja Ji’s men in large forest of eastern Chirakkal was crushed by British. If there was large and long revolt warfare in Chirakkal, it would have immensely profited Raja Ji. Though there was a lot of supporters of Raja Ji in Chirakkal, as revolt collapsed fast as rebels opted for open confrontation instead of time-honoured guerrilla warfare. Another cause for failure of revolt was treacherous Kolkar (Kolkar were Indian but served the British).\n\nSo once more rebel force had to retreat to Wayanad. They were hotly chased by British who had 2000 Sepoys and 1000 Kolkar. A reward of 3000 pagodas was offered for Raja Ji along with 1000 Pagodas for Edachena Kungan and bounties were put on heads of 10 other associates of Raja Ji.\n\nBut rebels, mostly Kurumbas, struck at Churikunji in Wayanad. Though they had to withdraw, they had devastated their enemy. That year, a party of Kolkar nearly caught Raja Ji but he escaped thanks to timely warning of a Kurumba guard.\n\nBut monsoon and brutal climate of Wayanad soon aided Raja Ji. Of 1300 Kolkar only 170 were not sick by October. **Raja Ji and Edachena Kungan organised a large force of Kurichias and Kurumbas at Pulpally shrine and positioned them to as far as Kurichiyat**. Also, the effort of Kungan to rally Nayar nobles of Wayanad to support Raja Ji’s war-effort had succeeded.\n\nBritish for the past couple of years had not suffered a loss on a scale of Periya in 1797, but matters were not easy for British at all. Even in Kottayam which had become quiet might explode once more and a large rebel force with Raja Ji as the head was still at large. But one must remember that the whole revolt is a one-man show as Wellesley himself remarked once-“We are not fighting 1000 men ... but one man ... Kerala Varma.”-Raja Ji’s end would mean the end of revolt.\n\n# Betrayal and Death of Raja Ji\n\nT.H. Baber went to Mysore to direct operations himself and began a large search for informants and traitors. True, British themselves admit that they did not get a lot of informants as locals were devoted to Raja Ji, but some of those few informants proved devastating to revolt and one of these traitors was a Chetti (his name was not revealed), found out where Raja Ji had camped and informed Baber who took to field with 100 Kolkar and 50 Sepoys.\n\n\\[But it must be added in this context that had Pazhayamviden Chandu not given British a full and clear picture about inner workings of Pazhassi military force, British could not have destroyed Pazhassi Raja Ji. Pazhassi Raja Ji\'s war machine was an enigma for British before the autumn of 1805. But since recruitment of turncoat Pazhayamviden to British imperial service in 1800, the British fully understood their elusive enemy – and consequences were fatal for Pazhassi Raja Ji and his cause. But to his credit and credit of his followers and subjects, he gave a bloody five-year fight to British across Northern Malabar.\\]\n\n**There is one school of thought that blames Pazhayamviden Chandu as solely responsible for fall of Raja Ji and end of his revolt.** Pazhayamviden worked with British military authority as an "adviser" like Pallore Eman, but in reality spied for Raja Ji. But in autumn of 1805 Pazhayamviden decided to betray all military secrets of his master for a large sum of money.\n\nIn light of above points, it will not be far fetched to believe that Chetti who guided British troops to Raja Ji\'s hideout mentioned by Baber in his letter could be a servant or agent of Pazhayamviden Chandu.\n\nOn 1805, 30 November, Raja Ji and retainers were camped near close to Karnataka on the shore of a stream named Mavila or Mavila Tod. Raja Ji and party were caught by surprise and an intense but short fight followed. Six rebels were killed. One of them was the great Pazhassi Raja Ji.\n\n**Given below is an account of final moments of Raja Ji-**\n\n*"The night of 29 November 1805 was surprisingly hot and humid in the jungles beyond Wayanad. A small army of rebels from Malabar had crossed over to the Mysore side and was holed up there, hidden from the British. None of them could sleep properly and there was a sense of unease."*\n\n*"The following morning, their leader, Kerala Varma, was up early. It was an important day for him, his mother\'s death anniversary. He bathed in the Mavila Thodu, and finished his prayers. He discussed strategy with his men for a while, and then they formed a protective circle around him as he sat on the bank and the ceremonies began. Suddenly, in the middle of the rituals, they found themselves surrounded by the English army under Sub-Collector Thomas Harvey Baber."*\n\n*"Bullets were fired and the men scattered. His men pleaded with Kerala Varma to escape, but he refused. In the ensuing confusion, a bullet caught him in the chest. With a prayer to Sriporkali, his clan deity, he collapsed on the bank. His men stood helpless, watching the end of their only hope of freedom."*\n\nBut evidently, wounded Raja Ji did live long enough for a few more minutes to raise his loaded gun and then tell Canara Menon, an East India Company minor official, not to come too close to his dying body and pollute it. Raja Ji\'s contempt and sarcasm for a man who chose to serve unclean foreigner are evident. But it also showed his uncompromising stand towards collaborators and foreign invaders.\n\nAralat Kutty Nambiar, another outlawed noble, who accompanied Raja Ji fought a desperate duel with the enemy and met a hero\'s death. Four other followers of Raja Ji also were killed in action and his sickly wife and her maids were taken as prisoner. Sick wife of Raja Ji along with her maids too were arrested but T.H. Baber took care to ensure treatment for the sickly widow of Raja Ji.\n\nTo the credit of T. H. Baber, he treated Raja Ji’s body with due respect and arranged for cremation with full traditional honours. Baber justified his respectful treatment in following words:\n\n*“I was induced to this conduct from the consideration that, although a rebel, he was one of the natural chieftains of the country, and might be considered on that account rather as a fallen enemy.”*\n\nBaber also added:\n\n*“Thus terminated the career of a man who has been enabled persevere in hostilities against the Company for near nine years, during which many thousand valuable lives have been sacrificed and sums of all money beyond all calculation expended.”*\n\n***As Always thanks for reading and feel free to correct if any mistake is found.***\n\nFollow r HindutvaRises'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'g7whnq'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g7whnq/pazhassi_raja_the_lion_of_kerala_4/</li>

He detested the very idea of foisting vegetarianism on the tribals or putting a stop to their animal sacrifice rituals.\n\n&gt;While parting, he would give a framed photo of Lord Hanuman or a wooden Hanuman idol to the tribal family, charging them Rs 50. His choice of Hanuman stemmed from the fact that the tribals worshipped the monkey god.\n\n&gt;After establishing a popular base among the tribals, he set up an ashram-cum-residential school at Vaghai, which turned out to be a huge success.

      <li>Title::: 'How does one get someone out of a multilevel marketing scheme like QNet?'<br />Body: 'Hi everyone.\n\nMy brother in law has fallen hard into the clutches of QNet. To give a short description, QNet is an MLM which has been banned in many countries, has several FIRs against its members in various cities of India and operates like your standard MLM - you join by paying a hefty amount, then you bring more people under you who go on to do the same and so on. They have some fancy, luxurious products which are heavily overpriced (20 green tea teabags for Rs.1500, 500 ml honey for Rs.1000, etc etc).\n\nNow he has had a tough time since 2018, I’ll give him that. He first lost his well paying government job due to some fraud allegations, for which he had to haemorrhage money like anything to keep his name out of FIR, chargesheet, etc etc (This is what my family and I were told while loaning money from us. I don’t know whether the charges were true, if the money really went for paying the lawyer, bribing the cops, etc. Let’s keep that aside for a while). He had purchased a new house and car just before his job termination, which meant regular EMIs. So I can understand that he was the perfect Bakra for whoever lured him into this QNet. His state of mind would have been terrible with so much debts, EMIs that QNet would seem like the perfect plan to him. Get rich quick.\n\nIt has been 2 years now since his job termination and I estimate he got into QNet in 2019, after his official job termination letter came from his organisation . And he is still draining money, only now in QNet. I don’t understand how he cannot see the fraud in this. Till now I had kept quiet and had just starting ignoring his calls, texts, etc even though he had borrowed a significant amount of money from me as well, but I was furious when I came to know yesterday that he tried his QNet fraud on my young cousin sometime in 2019 March. This cousin doesn’t even have a job and earns a decent amount by giving home tuitions. This loser took him to a QNet meeting, gave my cousin the usual deal, and my completely enamoured cousin “invested” his savings of one year, around Rs.25000. Some of you might say that it was my cousin’s mistake, but mind you, he’s just a kid, only 24 years old, who has never gone out of our hometown. He is not a Dilliwala or some clever guy. Plus, the position of respect &amp; trust of his Jija Jee was enough to assure of cousin that his money is safe. I don’t blame him. Poor kid has not told a soul in this world about his loss, not his family, not his own brother, fearing souring of relations between 2 families and of course the fear of getting scolded by his parents for being so gullible.\n\nMy mom, uncle and I, all have given money to this relative during his job termination hassle days. He kept on telling us that things are getting sorted on his organisation’s end, he might get reinstated, he just needs to pay so and so lawyer, so and so union, so and so cop and we never questioned him. But after he attended his first QNet conference with his whole family in Delhi, we had all adopted the path of ignoring him and just being in touch with my sister for being updated. But after this cousin scandal has come in my knowledge, I feel all elders need to step in. \n\nI don’t know what bullshit he fed his family that they went to attend the conference with him. My sister says they have daily fights over this in which he gives statements like “Whatever Google says doesn’t mean is true, if it’s a scam then why is the company running since so many years, the day I will have money I will show everyone it is not a scam”, etc etc. I don’t know why his father lent him money to invest, what lies he fed him, or that his father is just a plain, old man who himself got duped by own son. Right now, his own father is running his household and my sister teaches in a small play school. This guy has no shame left and puts WhatsApp status denigrating 9-5 jobs, shares videos of BMWs, Rolex, etc with “motivational quotes” of Jack Ma, Elon Musk, APJ Kalam, etc. My blood boils on seeing this. My sister frequently shares her plight with me and I feel helpless. I really care for them , my whole family does and it’s heartbreaking to see this downfall of a hardworking, talented man. I don’t know why his own father doesn’t kick him out of their house and leave him to fend from himself. This guy has no worry in the world. He knows no relative from whom he’s taken money is going to ask for it, his household is running, he’s getting his food cooked, clothes washed, etc. He even has a 2 year old daughter. I have told my sister numerous times to just go back to our house for some time so that this loser realises something at least, but I don’t know what stops her. (Her sasural and maayka are both in same locality). Maybe she thinks things will get better. I don’t know.\n\nHow do I bring this man back from this mess? I know I can’t do much, since I am younger to him so I don’t command that influence over him or can’t even give some dhamki to knock some sense, but what can my mother, uncle or his father do? I feel kicking him out of the house is one way and they can do that easily I feel- they have 2 houses in the city, one belongs to father, one is the newly bought one that belongs to him. Just leave the loser to fend from himself. Why are his parents paying for his ration?\n\nHas anyone amongst you ever seen such a case and have seen anyone recovering? What kind of threats can be given to him? Is that even the way to go, or should we proceed with love and care? Basically anything to bring him back to senses? Any legal route?'<br />Author: '2throwawaythrowaway'  id: 'g79ev8'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g79ev8/how_does_one_get_someone_out_of_a_multilevel/</li>

For decades, China has been hailed as the “world’s factory”, over its low labour costs and export-driven economy. But foreign companies are now [looking](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/we-are-over-dependent-on-china-1000-firms-wish-to-come-to-india-covid-19-proves-why-india-is-the-best-destination/amp/) to exit China and their preferred choice to relocate, is of course, India.\n\n***However, before we get too excited, we must recall the horrendous experiences with NGOs which have overturned India’s chances at getting FDI with various agitations.***\n\nJapanese companies are looking for a new location after the Shinzo Abe government announced a package worth US $2.2 billion to help manufacturers [shift](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/pack-up-and-get-out-of-there-japan-to-pay-2-2-billion-to-get-japanese-companies-to-exit-china/) production out of China. The state of Uttar Pradesh, led by CM Yogi Adityanath is now planning to [woo](https://tfipost.com/2020/04/leave-china-and-come-to-up-yogi-government-plans-special-package-to-woo-companies-fleeing-china/) these companies fleeing China.\n\nAlso exiting China are South Korean majors such as Hyundai Steel and POSCO are looking to exit China and they plan to set up their factories in the state of Andhra Pradesh, in what can be a massive boost for PM Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and FDI inflows into India.\n\nThe fast-changing world order goes very much in India’s favour and can propel India’s ambitions of becoming a US $ 5 trillion by 2024. In fact, foreign companies exiting China and entering India has long term benefits, as India could become the new engine of world growth.\n\n***At the forefront of this anti-development campaign to block foreign investments is the NGOs nexus that directly or indirectly sabotages crucial projects in the garb of farmer rights or environmental vigilantism.***\n\nAccording to a 2014 Intelligence Bureau (IB) [report](https://timesofindia.com/india/Foreign-funded-NGOs-stalling-development-IB-report/articleshow/36411169.cms), foreign-funded NGOs such as Greenpeace, Cordaid, Amnesty and Action Aid have been\xa0 “serving as tools for foreign policy interests of western governments” by sponsoring agitations against nuclear and coal-fired power plants in India. For eg.\n\n*In Tamil Nadu, protests had led to the closure of Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper Plant in Tuticorin, which not only hurt the copper industry but also thousands of medium and small sector units whose businesses were dependent on Vedanta’s plant.Later, Chinese companies were* [*alleged*](https://tfipost.com/2019/06/vedanta-chinese-sterlite-protests-01/amp/) *to have funded the anti-Sterlite protests in India that actually had a very negative impact on India’s Copper production,* [*forcing*](https://tfipost.com/2019/10/india-imports-copper-for-the-first-time-in-18-years-reason-the-shutdown-of-sterlite-plant/amp/) *the country to import Copper for the first time in 18 years.*\n\n***The ambitious*** [***Hyperloop***](https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2020/01/18/maharashtra-puts-brakes-on-hyperloop-richard-bransons-worst-fear-comes-true.html) ***and*** [***Bullet train***](https://tfipost.com/2019/12/stalling-bullet-train-would-mean-uddhav-inviting-pm-modis-wrath-and-pm-modi-wont-be-kind/) ***projects in Maharashtra- both of which could have accelerated the state’s growth unprecedentedly have also run into trouble ever since the Uddhav Thackeray government came to power in Maharashtra***.\n\nAnd this is not just about specific cases of protests, especially in the tribal, Naxal-dominated areas. The sheer vigilantism of the NGOs has led to obnoxious legislation like the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.\n\nThis Act has created [bottlenecks](https://economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/five-years-on-has-land-acquisition-act-fulfilled-its-aim/articleshow/65639336.cms) for several projects such as POCSO’s steel project in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, and US investments in the Modi government’s flagship “Smart Cities” [project](https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-us-tells-india-to-resolve-land-acquisition-fdi-issues-to-set-up-smart-cities-2081432).\n\nToday, a number of companies are looking towards India, but the mighty Dragon won’t let the situation go out of its hands so easily. It might try to collude with the foreign funded NGOs in India, in order to push against its Indian competitors.\n\nThe foreign funding of NGOs keeps [going up,](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/opinion-foreign-donations-with-hidden-agenda-are-serious-danger-to-indias-national-security/346340) despite the Modi government [tightening](https://tfipost.com/2018/04/ngos-fcra-01/) the screws under the FCRA norms. The NGOs will in all probability continue with their hidden agenda, and it is time for the Modi government to effectively address all key stakeholders.\n\nIndia offers the perfect conditions for any MNC, but the ambitions to emerge as a “manufacturing hub” could go down the drain given the hostile NGO ecosystem and networks within India.

      <li>Title::: 'Wearing a bindi in the west.'<br />Body: "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently a college student in a western country, where the primary religions are Christianity and atheism.\n\nI used to wear a bindi from when I was a baby to the age of about six or even, full time. After that, for whatever reason, I stopped wearing it and I am now twenty years old and only wear it for special festivals and pujas.\n\nDuring the quarantine in my country, I've been reading more about Hinduism and learning more about my culture. As someone born and raised in the west, I was taught some things about my religion but my overall knowledge on it could be much better.\n\nI'm obviously not going out much right now, but when the quarantine orders are lifted, I was thinking about maybe wearing a bindi to college. I did do that once and got nervous because people were looking at me - so I stopped. I am proud of my religion and my culture and I feel like if Muslims can feel okay wearing the hijab, and if Christians can feel okay wearing necklaces with crosses, then why do I feel so scared? I have only seen one other person in my two years at college wearing a bindi - and even then it was so tiny I didn't even realise the first time I met her.\n\nI do want to represent my culture and religion and so I think I would like to start wearing one when I go outside now. Another issue I have, though, is that I mostly wear western clothes, and my mom tells me that wearing a bindi with western wear wouldn't look good.\n\nAlso, if I start wearing a bindi, does that mean I have to wear it every day from then on? What if I want to wear it one day and then don't feel like wearing it the next - is that okay, or do I have to make a complete shift? And if not, what do I do when people ask me why I was wearing a bindi one day but not another day?\n\nI'd love to know your opinions on these points, and whether you think I (and other Hindus in the west, potentially) should wear a bindi. Is it good for representation and visibility of Hindus? Or bad because I should just embrace the western culture over here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing what you guys think.

      <li>Title::: 'Dharmic view on the misconception of Hindu atheism (Atheistic Materialism)'<br />Body: '[Based on a Twitter thread by @shrikanth_krish](https://twitter.com/shrikanth_krish/status/1253548773042774017?s=19)\n\n1. "Hindu" atheism can be viewed as "Hindu" only if you interpret the word "Hindu" to include every thought current native to the subcontinent\nBut strictly speaking, atheistic materialism (even that of the Lokāyatas) is antagonistic to most principles of Hindu religion\n\n2. There is a tendency to think the only fundamental difference between atheistic schools like Lokāyatas and "orthodox" Hinduism rests on the question of "belief" in a Personal God\nThat\'s not true. The differences are numerous\n\n3. Lokāyatas / Charvākas reject Karma, re-birth, religious rites, varṇāshrama dharma\nThey show little to no interest in metaphysics. They are skeptical of "inferred" knowledge. \nAnd they do not acknowledge the importance of the "invisible"\n\n4. The obsession with "empiricism", the distaste for moral theorizing, distaste for philosophy in general, and a lack of enthusiasm for the "examined" life is what characterizes schools like that of Lokāyatas\n\n5. This runs contrary to the predominant intellectual currents in India for the past 3000+ years that have ALWAYS emphasized the "invisible"\n\n6. In that respect, the great Greek Socratic philosophers (be it Plato or Aristotle) are less distant to mainstream HIndu thought than Lokāyatas \nBecause Plato and Aristotle always acknowledged the "soul". And the importance of the Invisible.\n\n7. Plato in his "Republic" engages in abstractions. In constructing "ideals"\nThat stems from a penchant for the "invisible" - which is in its roots a religious outlook\nA pure materialist would never engage in abstractions the way Plato did\n\n8. For a materialist, the only reality is the "observed" reality.\nThere is no room for imagination. For idealizations. For ordering of "values"\nNot a surprise that Lokāyatas had a very relaxed attitude towards all kinds of sensual pleasures\n\n9. Because in the materialist view, you can never  honestly engage in moralizing and creating a hierarchy of values\nAs that is not based on the "observed" reality\nIt is not "objective" so to speak \n\n10. In one of the Charvaka texts it is stated - \n\n"The enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while moksha is death which is cessation of life-breath..."\n(Contd...)\n\n11. "the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of moksha.\nA fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings"\n\n12. This is rank hedonism. Period.\n\nThe Charvaka authors are closer in spirit to Michel Foucault than any Hindu thinker in India.\nEven several Christian theologians are less distant to us than Charvakas (though this may not go down well with parts of H-Right)\n\n13. To side with Charvakas / Lokayatas is to not merely be un-Hindu, but it amounts to a rejection of moral philosophy, a rejection of the usefulness of "abstractions", a rejection of the "invisible", and a rejection of the "examined life"\n\n14. The thread was on "atheistic materialism" per se in Indian thought.\nIn popular discourse, when people talk of Hindu atheism, they don\'t refer to Sankhya but primarily Charvakas / Lokayatas\n\nAdditional info:\n\nThough Hindu thinkers have been critical of Jainism and Buddhism in the past, the latter still hold on to concepts like hierarchy of values, polytheist, heaven and hell, rebirth, etc. \n\nUnlike Lokayata, other Shramana traditions place emphasis on texts and ritualism.'<br />Author: 'anujjv51'  id: 'g74vcb'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g74vcb/dharmic_view_on_the_misconception_of_hindu/</li>

Liberals might take China's side. But, conservatives have very compelling arguments to convince the general populace. It doesn't matter who is right when it comes to convincing a mass.\n\n• India being the major producer of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drug did a good thing by lifting the export restrictions.

      <li>Title::: 'Soldiers of Hindutva you are repeating the same mistakes again like our ancestors.'<br />Body: "**I hope your anger hasn't subsided about lynching of Sadhus in Maharashtra.**\n\n**Myself:** Back in the year 2012 when Indian society was degrading under UPA I wanted to do something on Internet/Social media to counter the narrative of Indian media who were very much owned by Indian National Congress. I remember those days where Arnab was not accused by Leftists as working for BJP. Social media was actually catching on like wild fire in India. BJP supporters literally owned every inch of Social media. There was no organized effort, just individuals countering the narrative of Indian Leftists who were unchallenged on Mainstream media until Social media came along. Defending Modi and making him PM in 2014 was the goal of every BJP supporter online. Lot of news sites had Disqus for comments on their articles, so I used to counter their narrative on online portals. It was a more very small field. But comments on articles was very important as it gave a new perspective to the reader and called our any lies in the article. That is why I chose that. Now unfortunately all online portals have removed Disqus. I had little time in my life so I could only do this.  [https://disqus.com/by/concard/](https://disqus.com/by/concard/) After 2014 life happened and got even more busy. BJP was winning states after states and the BJP online narrative was dominating over Congress. Yet I continued for a while but dropped off the radar after few years since online portals no longer offered Disqus. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the meantime Leftists have strengthened their online war. You have people who follow Dhruv Rathee forming squads to downvote answers on quora, abuse and spread fake news on Social media. After 2014 loss Leftists flooded the Internet with online portals like Scroll, Quint, Wire, Scoopwhoop. BJP has only Swarajya. Even on this Reddit there are so many subreddits where Hindutva ideologues are scattered. Everyone is shooting arrows in different directions without hitting the enemy. We cannot let Leftists dominate the Internet like they dominated TV and News media for the last 70 years and still continue to dominate. Heck even Wikipedia is compromised. I present a action plan to reverse this trend:\n\n* We need all Hindutva ideologues under one banner/one subreddit. I don't want to create new subreddit and split our folks even more. \n* We need constructive discussion limiting to just 2 original posts per day which can include discussions on politics, Economics, foreign policy, Military, History etc. Please let us get rid off the memes and low quality content. \n* The engagement rate on this sub is very low compared to India subreddit. That is why giving importance to quality is more important. By limiting to just 2 posts we can make the job of Mods easier. \n* Once we have a strong community we can spread out to Whatsapp, Telegram and invite more people in. Here spreading out means I am not suggesting abandoning the subreddit. \n* Let us atleast do our bare minimum to protect our civilization, culture and our country. The lynching of Sadhus was not new, Hindus have faced many similar situations in the past. We need to act now and strengthen the core of our movement. \n* Let us give a voice to everyone whether we agree or disagree regardless of caste. \n* Finally let us educate ourselves about our history. True Indology does a wonderful job on Twitter but his account was already banned once on Twitter. Without empowering ourselves with knowledge we cannot take our movement forward. \n* Let us not repeat the same mistake as our ancestors. 6 years of BJP government has created some fatigue even though we have achieved some great things. We need to persist and persevere like RSS who never gave up and still never give up. \n\nI hope my post is not in any violation of the subreddit or Reddit. If so, please notify me I will be happy to edit it. I invite Mods to contribute suggestions if they have any. \n\nPS: I am new to Reddit. Please excuse me if I made any mistake."<br />Author: 'concard88'  id: 'g5y8ht'<br />Score:57<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g5y8ht/soldiers_of_hindutva_you_are_repeating_the_same/</li>

That will save you from the ill fame of misusing My friendship and from losing your prestige in society."  \nSo, the final judgment of the Lord was for Arjuna to die in the battle and not withdraw.  \n**Question 1 : On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, what advice the Lord is giving to Arjuna ?**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omr2zqgq1au41.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5224b181e522330609aa12be0b9571c6d54a1684\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download our Android App from here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'g5sngd'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g5sngd/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_234/</li>

The police later arrested one Sonu Yadav for the murder with the motive being robbery.\n\n- Devotees entered one Chhotunath temple in Haryana’s Fatehabad and discovered a pile of ash.

State supremacy- Yesterday I was watching a debate on television and ShivSena MP said that Maharashtra is not UP-Bihar where police needs guns to control public. People of Maharashtra are very sensible. It's not the first time that people of other states made offensive remarks about people of UP-Bihar. Some years before, people of other states asked me did everyone at my town has a katta as I belong to these unfortunate states. I get it, we people of UP and Bihar don't have a separate, superior identity like Marathi, Punjabi, Bengali, Tamil, Malyali and most of people of other states consider us a burden despite the fact that most army personnel who get martyred fighting terrorists belong to these two 'beemaru' states. I mean as a person, I have respected Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose as much I respect Chandrashekhar Azad but why are we treated as just insects and people have a new name for us 'Cow Belt'. We are humiliated by North-eastern people who cry racism at even smallest of things, we are ridiculed by south India who call us illiterates, and even Punjabis make fun of us. Are we humiliated only because we identify as an Indian more than our state. It's our people who get killed at the borders most. And for your kind information, those who are so proud of their state identities, you are only a lowly brown in the eyes of foreigners no matter how superior you consider yourself in India. The Sadhus who are killed belong to Uttar Pradesh. Is this the reason their lives are considered so cheap?\n\n.\n\n2. The second thing India is failing is- Though present government and army are working exceedingly well to curb terrorist threats, but I'm absolutely disappointed that how this government is handling academia and media. The thing is if you speak a lie for infinitely many times for years, it achieves the same status as truth and India is doing nothing to counter the lies being peddled by the likes of The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post. I know Congress and Left had decades to solidify their hold on academia and foreign media but the present government is failing completely on information war. I know many of you will oppose my views and this post of mine will also get downvoted as my previous posts in this sub, but a strong censoring is needed in this country. There is a soft terrorism going on through subtle means like Netflix web series like Ghoul, Leila, The Sacred Games and Family Man and I understand freedom of expression is important in a country but we have to understand, if we get an ISIS rule or East India Company, we will not be free even to be an atheist. We have to decide which freedom is more important to us. Books, TV shows and movies justifying terrorism, naxalites should be completely banned in the country. Hell, we are the only country where movies like Mission Kashmir, Fiza, The Family Man are made which justify the act of becoming a terrorist. Also, in my opinion, the hold of madarsas and missionary schools should be minimised in our country. What's the use of religion in education? I've studied in missionary school and there were many overt attempts to convince our impressionable seven year old minds the superiority of their religion and Jesus and making fun of Hinduism. You can kill terrorists but if you don't destroy the intellectual infrastructure in their support, terrorism will be just like a Raktabeej.\n\n.\n\n3. Feminism- I am a devotee of Lord Rama and throughout my last life, I'm chided for supporting a person who didn't respect his wife. Girls tell me how bad Lord Rama was for abandoning Sitaji and if I want to worship, I must worship Durgaji and Shivji not a person like Lord Rama. And the funny thing is I don't think any of them has read Ramayana carefully. The soul aim of Agnipariksha was to get Sitaji back from Agni who was replaced by Chhaya Sita before she was abducted by Raavan. And regarding Lord Rama abandoning Sitaji, every time has a different set of rules and a king has to follow Rajdharm. If a son isn't present during last rites of his father, he's not performing his duties as a son but if that son had the responsibility to protect a state, it becomes different. We have to see a thing in its whole context. Feminists conveniently skip the part where despite knowing King Dashrathji couldn't handle separation from his son, Lord Rama goes for Vanvaas and Lord Rama even gave Desh Nikala to Lakshmanji after which the latter took Jal Samadhi in Saryu (He was going to give death sentence to Lakshmanji). This doesn't mean Lord Rama didn't love his father and brother but he was bound by Dharma. Feminists conveniently forget the persecution of women in Abrahamic religions and love bashing so-called ' 'Hindu Brahminical patriarchy' completely ignoring the fact that only Hindu religion gives the most respect and freedom to women. And I don't think making fun of our goddesses in feminism.\n\n.\n\nI am not a religious person but if India falls prey to foreign powers, I will not have the freedom even to be an atheist. India is the last land left where the indigenous culture has not become extinct after external attacks like Egypt, Native American, Greece. It's not about Gods. I know they don't need to be protected as they are almighty themselves, but it is to preserve our country and our ancient identity.\n\nI know this seems like a rant but I couldn't not speak it.

After fighting and defeating Lord Śiva in the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the Lord and received as a reward a weapon called pāśupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even Droṇācārya gave him benediction and awarded him the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher. So he was credited with so many military certificates from many authorities, including his adopted father Indra, the heavenly king. But if he abandoned the battle, he would not only neglect his specific duty as a kṣatriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to hell.

The display network allows you to reach people by placing ads:\n\n* On the website they are browsing. [Reference](https://imgur.com/5SOKK1P)\n* A video they are watching. [Reference](https://imgur.com/56RrF7w)\n* In their Gmail accounts. [Reference](https://imgur.com/KaiEr7B)\n\n# Why Use a Display Campaign\n\nGoogle Display network is best used for brand building. Here is why:\n\n* Googles’ display network reaches 90% of the global internet and across millions of sites worldwide\n* Cost per click is cheaper than that of the search network\n* Display visitors generally start way earlier in the decision making process, so you have a chance to be in front of them right from the start\n* You have option to add highly interactive animated ads or video ads\n* Besides keywords, you can target users based on what they are in the market for, topics of websites they visit, their characteristics, the kind of websites they visit and more\n\n# Targeting Options\n\nTargeting options that are currently available can be divided into two groups as:\n\n* People — who you want to reach. You have an option to define an audience or a demographic or a combination of the two here. Example, you can choose someone who is actively searching to buy a car and also they have to be 25 years old or more\n* Content — where you want your ads to show. You have options to target certain keywords, topics, entire websites or a combination of them all. Example, you can target webpages where the keyword “ppc agency” appears or target a webpage discussing “Advertising and Marketing” or simply target all of “[www.freepressjournal.com](http://www.freepressjournal.com/)”\n\n[Here](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/10/google-display-network-targeting) is a good article that goes in-depth at the various options available for you to target. When I structure my campaign, I usually keep one targeting option or a combination of targets per ad group. This makes it easier for me to judge which targeting works best for the objective my clients want to achieve.\n\n# How to Create a Display Campaign\n\n* On the main Google Ads screen, click the “+” to get started. [Reference](https://imgur.com/4IQCYDs)\n* Select “New Campaign”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/SbRDClF)\n* Here, select “Create a campaign without a goal’s guidance”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/sNiaScf)\n* Then, select “Display”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/iCgjj5W)\n* Select “Standard Display” campaign. [Reference](https://imgur.com/NXr37jI)\n* Enter your website address and hit “Continue”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/ysql4Qe)\n* Enter the name of the campaign. Make it so that it is easy to identify that this is a display campaign. [Reference](https://imgur.com/YtirLtm)\n* Click on “Enter Another Location”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/sV591Xn)\n* Enter the location you want to target in the given area, select it from the list above and click on “Target”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/sYeavld)\n* If you hit on exclude, it will exclude that location. [Reference](https://imgur.com/9s6Iofa)\n* There is another way to add locations. Click on “Advanced Search”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/yHFodMA)\n* Here you can enter a location and target or exclude it the same way we just did or select a radius around a certain area. Click on “Radius”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/PEMWh0E)\n* Here, enter the location around which you want to target, enter how far the radius should be and make sure you get the units right. Click “Target” and hit Save. [Reference](https://imgur.com/lvDleXl). [Reference](https://imgur.com/TBGuLva). [Reference](https://imgur.com/ALV0cxk)\n* Click on “Location Options” and make sure you are entering these options. [Reference](https://imgur.com/A9HBFIi)\n* Select the language you want to add here. Just remember that people who have set that language as their browser setting will only see it. I usually select all languages when I have target a multicultural target location. [Reference](https://imgur.com/woFFoGR)\n* Next, scroll down a bit and click on “Or, select a bid strategy directly” while ignoring the warning (don’t worry about it for now). [Reference](https://imgur.com/zB27REo)\n* Click on the drop down and select “Manual CPC”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/xIzyen2). [Reference](https://imgur.com/CSBu4bY)\n* Enter a budget in the given space, and Google should give you some estimates. Remember these estimates. [Reference](https://imgur.com/sdPMXzC)\n* Click on “Additional Settings”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/RmqkqFi)\n* Scroll down to “Frequency Capping” and click it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/al20Uzh)\n* Click on “Set a Limit”. This will limit how many times a user sees your ad in a day. It’s not good to bombard someone with the same ad too much. I usually set it to 5 impressions per day. [Reference](https://imgur.com/GC7HzxC). [Reference](https://imgur.com/ZLOYbTV)\n* Click on “Content Exclusions”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/Yd4FgBi)\n* You should exclude your ad from showing up on sensitive content containing mature content or profanity. Also, excluding “Parked Domains” helps. Here are all the exclusions. [Reference](https://imgur.com/JhqhdLH)\n* Scroll down and type in the name of one of the target groups as the ad group name. [Reference](https://imgur.com/gcMEjh4)\n* Scroll down to “Audiences” and select “Browse”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/S3pk4hu)\n* These are all the options available for you to target. Explore each one of them to help you understand and strategize who all you can target. You can add multiple audiences to one ad group. For our purpose I will show you how to target someone who is In Market for Business Services\n* Click on “What they are actively searching for”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/tec2SzH)\n* Click on “In Market Audiences”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/3RhXFPI)\n* Scroll through the list and find your in-market audience and select it. [Reference](https://imgur.com/DKN91ju)\n* You can narrow some audiences down further by clicking on the downward arrow next to it and selecting one from the options there. [Reference](https://imgur.com/Arp7vCz)\n* I usually keep both the broad category and a specific category to see which performs better. I am adding “Advertising and Marketing Services” here. Once you are done selecting your audiences, click on “Done”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/EmIgCgk)\n* Next, open up demographics. [Reference](https://imgur.com/U9Rh2Ak)\n* Here, generally I deselect 18–24 year olds, as they hardly ever make a purchase decision for the products and services I work with. But that might not make sense to you. Select or deselect the ones that suitable to you and hit done. Never deselect “Unknowns”, that’s where most of the traffic is. Once you have selected your audience, click “Done”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/SLobtBd)\n* Selection of content targeting is explained below. Scroll down to it if you wanted to add content targeting to your ad group\n* Scroll down and switch off target expansion. We don’t want Google to show ads unnecessarily to people we shouldn’t target. [Reference](https://imgur.com/H4f0x6K)\n* Add the ad group bid. The performance estimates on the right should have changed by now. Round off and add the bid that you noted down earlier. We try to reduce it to after we start getting some data. [Reference](https://imgur.com/VG5uPbs)\n* Next, click on “New Ad”. [Reference](https://imgur.com/0rrszL2)\n* Click on “Responsive Display Ad”.

      <li>Title::: 'India’s Rakhine dilemma vis-à-vis $ 484 million Kaladan Multimodal project'<br />Body: "In a strange rush to complete and operationalize the $ 484 million Kaladan Multimodal project, India risk getting sucked into what essentially is Myanmar’s problem – tackling an invigorated insurgency in the country’s coastal province of Rakhine (previously Arakan).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Arakan Army** **(AA)**, formed in 2009, is a ‘New Age' rebel group, unlike territory holding Kachins and Karen fighters. Its calculated offensive against the *Tatmadaw* in both rural and urban areas has significantly weakened the state’s grip on the strategic Rakhine province, where both China and India have initiated major connectivity projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chinese have finished the Kyaukphyu deep sea port and is going ahead with a Special Economic Zone around it with rail-road and oil-gas pipelines linking it with Yunnan province. The Indians have renovated the Sittwe port and is seeking to use it to connect to Mizoram province through Kaladan river.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The Arakan Army is pursuing a different kind of warfare, it is not trying to hold territory so far, it hits the Tatmadaw hard and then just vanishes, the Burmese troops have no answer to this highly mobile warfare,” says Bertil Lintner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter years of delay, India finally kicked off the construction of the 109-km road project that connects Paletwa river terminal to Zorinpui on the Mizoram border in Myanmar in 2018. But work on this phase of the project has been tortuously slow, one reason being the Arakan Army’s constant disruptions by kidnap of workers involved with the road and bridge construction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Rs 1,600 crore road project that passes through dense forests and hilly areas was awarded to Delhi-based **C&amp;C Constructions** in June 2017. But the contractor had to wait till January 2018 for the requisite clearances from the Myanmar government to start ground work. **The company lobbied for strong military action** and the Indian Army conducted **Operation Sunrise** last year to demolish the Arakan Army’s bases in southern Mizoram.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn completion, the project will help connect Mizoram with the Sittwe Port in Rakhine State of Myanmar. India has already completed the rest of the Kaladan project work in Myanmar. Completion of the Paletwa-Zorinpui road, therefore, holds the key to operationalise the Kaladan multi-modal project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut after Operation Sunrise, the Arakan Army has attacked Indian interests more regularly than ever before. In November last year, **five Indian workers** and four local workers involved with the Kaladan road project **were kidnapped**, alongwith a NLD MP in the Chin state.  A similar incident of abduction of local workers involved with the Kaladan project took place in March last year.  The Arakan Army rebels also set ablaze a civilian vessel carrying 300 steel frames for the Paletwa bridge and the crew were abducted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMizoram chief minister Zoramthanga recently told this writer that he has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and foreign minister S Jaishanker to appoint a new contractor for the Kaladan project because **C&amp;C has gone bankrupt**. “They (C&amp;C) have no idea how to do business in this area. Rakhine is not Indian territory and the Indian Army can’t do much. I have asked Delhi to appoint a new contractor who can then be properly advised,” Zoramthanga told this writer, hinting that the new contractor can be put in touch with the Arakan Army and could pay up to buy peace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The above is the summary of the following article** :  [https://nenow.in/neighbour/china/indias-rakhine-dilemma.html](https://nenow.in/neighbour/china/indias-rakhine-dilemma.html)"<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'g54twa'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g54twa/indias_rakhine_dilemma_visàvis_484_million/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Sri krishna katha'<br />Body: "'न कोई मरता है और न ही कोई मारता है, सभी निमित्त मात्र हैं...सभी प्राणी जन्म से पहले बिना शरीर के थे, मरने के उपरांत वे बिना शरीर वाले हो जाएँगे। यह तो बीच में ही शरीर वाले देखे जाते हैं, फिर इनका शोक क्यों करते हो।'- कृष्ण\n\n\nहिन्दू धर्म के एकमात्र धर्मग्रंथ है वेद। वेदों के चार भाग हैं- ऋग, यजु, साम और अथर्व। वेदों के सार को वेदांत या उपनिषद कहते हैं और उपनिषदों का सार या निचोड़ गीता में हैं। गीता हिन्दुओं का सर्वमान्य एकमात्र धर्मग्रंथ है।\n\n\n1.गीता के ज्ञान को भगवान श्रीकृष्ण ने अर्जुन से कुरुक्षेत्र में खड़े होकर दिया था। यह श्रीकृष्\u200dण-अर्जुन संवाद नाम से विख्\u200dयात है। \n\n2.वैसे तो गीता श्रीकृष्ण और अर्जुन के बीच हुआ एक संवाद है, लेकिन कहते हैं कि भगवान श्रीकृष्ण के माध्यम से उस कालरूप परम परमेश्वर ने गीता का ज्ञान विश्व को दिया। श्रीकृष्ण उस समय योगारूढ़ थे।\n\n3. गीता के चौथे अध्याय में कृष्णजी कहते हैं कि पूर्व काल में यह योग मैंने विवस्वान को बताया था। विवस्वान ने मनु से कहा। मनु ने इक्ष्वाकु को बताया। यूं पीढ़ी दर पीढ़ी परम्परा से प्राप्त इस ज्ञान को राजर्षियों ने जाना पर कालान्तर में यह योग लुप्त हो गया। और अब उस पुराने योग को ही तुम्हें पुन: बता रहा हूं। परंपरा से यह ज्ञान सबसे पहले विवस्वान् (सूर्य) को मिला था। जिसके पुत्र वैवस्वत मनु थे। \n\n5. श्रीकृष्ण के गुरु घोर अंगिरस थे। घोर अंगिरस ने देवकी पुत्र कृष्ण को जो उपदेश दिया था वही उपदेश श्रीकृष्ण गीता में अर्जुन को देते हैं। छांदोग्य उपनिषद में उल्लेख मिलता है कि देवकी पुत्र कृष्\u200dण घोर अंगिरस के शिष्य हैं और वे गुरु से ऐसा ज्ञान अर्जित करते हैं जिससे फिर कुछ भी ज्ञातव्य नहीं रह जाता है। यद्यपि गीता द्वापर युग में महाभारत के युद्ध के समय रणभूमि में किंकर्तव्यविमूढ़ अर्जुन को समझाने के लिए भगवान श्रीकृष्ण के द्वारा कही गई थी, किंतु इस वचनामृत की प्रासंगिकता आज तक बनी हुई है।\n\n6. गीता में भक्ति, ज्ञान और कर्म मार्ग की चर्चा की गई है। उसमें यम-नियम और धर्म-कर्म के बारे में भी बताया गया है। गीता ही कहती है कि ब्रह्म (ईश्वर) एक ही है। गीता को बार-बार पढ़ेंगे तो आपके समक्ष इसके ज्ञान का रहस्य खुलता जाएगा। गीता के प्रत्येक शब्द पर एक अलग ग्रंथ लिखा जा सकता है। गीता में सृष्टि उत्पत्ति, जीव विकासक्रम, हिन्दू संदेवाहक क्रम, मानव उत्पत्ति, योग, धर्म, कर्म, ईश्वर, भगवान, देवी, देवता, उपासना, प्रार्थना, यम, नियम, राजनीति, युद्ध, मोक्ष, अंतरिक्ष, आकाश, धरती, संस्कार, वंश, कुल, नीति, अर्थ, पूर्वजन्म, जीवन प्रबंधन, राष्ट्र निर्माण, आत्मा, कर्मसिद्धांत, त्रिगुण की संकल्पना, सभी प्राणियों में मैत्रीभाव आदि सभी की जानकारी है।\n\n\nश्रीमद्भगवद्गीता योगेश्वर श्रीकृष्ण की वाणी है। इसके प्रत्येक श्लोक में ज्ञानरूपी प्रकाश है, जिसके प्रस्फुटित होते ही अज्ञान का अंधकार नष्ट हो जाता है। ज्ञान-भक्ति-कर्म योग मार्गो की विस्तृत व्याख्या की गयी है, इन मार्गो पर चलने से व्यक्ति निश्चित ही परमपद का अधिकारी बन जाता है।\n\n7. 3112 ईसा पूर्व हुए भगवान श्रीकृष्ण का जन्म हुआ था। कलियुग का आरंभ शक संवत से 3176 वर्ष पूर्व की चैत्र शुक्ल एकम (प्रतिपदा) को हुआ था। वर्तमान में 1939 शक संवत है। आर्यभट्\u200dट के अनुसार महाभारत युद्ध 3137 ईपू में हुआ। इस युद्ध के 35 वर्ष पश्चात भगवान कृष्ण ने देह छोड़ दी थी तभी से कलियुग का आरंभ माना जाता है। उनकी मृत्यु एक बहेलिए का तीर लगने से हुई थी। तब उनकी तब उनकी उम्र 119 वर्ष थी। इसका मतलब की आर्यभट्ट के गणना अनुसार गीता का ज्ञान 5154 वर्ष पूर्व श्रीकृष्ण ने अर्जुन को दिया था।\n\n\n8.हरियाणा के कुरुक्षे\u200dत्र में जब यह ज्ञान दिया गया तब तिथि एकादशी थी। संभवत: उस दिन रविवार था। उन्होंने यह ज्ञान लगभग 45 मिनट तक दिया था। गीता में श्रीकृष्ण ने- 574, अर्जुन ने- 85, संजय ने 40 और धृतराष्ट्र ने- 1 श्लोक कहा है।\n\n9. गीता की गणना उपनिषदों में की जाती है। इसी\u200dलिये इसे गीतोपनिषद् भी कहा जाता है। दरअसल, यह महाभारत के भीष्म पर्व का हिस्सा है। महाभारत में ही कुछ स्थानों पर उसका हरिगीता नाम से उल्लेख हुआ है। (शान्ति पर्व अ. 346.10, अ. 348.8 व 53)। \n\n10. श्रीकृष्ण ने गीता का ज्ञान अर्जुन को इसलिये दिया क्योंकि वह कर्त्तव्य पथ से भटकर संन्यासी और वैरागी जैसा आचरण करके युद्ध छोड़ने को आतुर हो गया था वह भी ऐसे समय जब की सेना मैदान में डटी थी। ऐसे में श्रीकृष्ण को उन्हें उनका कर्तव्य निभाने के लिए यह ज्ञान दिया। गीता को अर्जुन के अलावा और संजय ने सुना और उन्होंने धृतराष्ट्र को सुनाया। \n\n11. गीता एकमात्र ऐसा ग्रंथ है जिस पर दुनियाभर की भाषा में सबसे ज्यादा भाष्य, टीका, व्याख्या, टिप्पणी, निबंध, शोधग्रंथ आदि लिखे गए हैं। आदि शंकराचार्य, रामानुज, रामानुजाचार्य, मध्वाचार्य, निम्बार्क, भास्कर, वल्लभ, श्रीधर स्वामी, आनन्द गिरि, मधुसूदन सरस्वती, संत ज्ञानेश्वर, बालगंगाधर तिलक, परमहंस योगानंद, महात्मा गांधी, सर्वपल्ली डॉ. राधाकृष्णन, महर्षि अरविन्द घोष, एनी बेसेन्ट, गुरुदत्त, विनोबा भावे, स्वामी चिन्मयानन्द, चैतन्य महाप्रभु, स्वामी नारायण, जयदयाल गोयन्दका, ओशो रजनीश, स्वामी क्रियानन्द, स्वामी रामसुखदास, श्रीराम शर्मा आचार्य आदि सैंकड़ों

      <li>Title::: 'Opinion : My views on Uniform Civil Code, and why it is not the best way to address demographic inversion in India'<br />Body: "Last week, a comment of mine was heavily downvoted r/Chodi and r/indiadiscussion where I criticised the idea of UCC, so I thought I would just lay out my points here and welcome a decent debate on this discourse. I know it seems weird for a right winger to oppose the UCC, but I'll lay out my reasons, and let us discuss the pros and cons of this topic.\n\ntldr : The UCC would not only prove harmful to the Indic communities, it would also make it easier for the left to brand the government as 'Anti-Muslim'. We need to make our cultural fundamentals strong footed, and the UCC would weaken us as much as it does to the other side. As far as deographic inversion is concerned, we need to approach this problem by nature and our duties towards mother earth, and not necessarily imposing UCC to stop excessive breeding.\n\nTo start off, I know most of the people have bought into the idea of a UCC necessarily because it comes from the anti-Congress side, but I'm not sure if people have really understood what the end result of such a legislation would be, and what its impact would be on the 'Indic' communities.\n\nWe need to realise that India has still not asked itself the question of what the Nehruvian dispensation of the Hindu code which was brought in around the 1950s, has done to the Hindu traditions. Probably we should focus on protecting our traditions before observing certain derogatory thresholds across the board.\n\nWhen it comes to civil rights, the line which separates the 'secular' from the 'religious' is very very thin, and this is a fact. So one never knows where they can end up encroaching the worldview, or beliefs of communities which has been practised through centuries or even milleniums, in our case, in the name of harmonising that structure.\n\nDo we really need a harmonised social structure in the name of preserving a national identity, or creating a social integration? Because applying that to the Hindu fold or the Indic fold may be problematic because there is such diversity amongst us. The UCC may harm our society more than what we think it would do to the other community.\n\nSo what I think, and this may offend many people, is that the Uniform Civil Code is perhaps a loser's argument, and I say this because it seems somebody who has lost his dignity is asking for a repeat of the same experience with the other community. The idea must be preservation and protection of our space first, as opposed to asking for the loss of everybody's space and identity.\n\nOne of the prime questions here would be that, in the absence of a UCC, every community will have a set of their rules to play by, and one of the major arguments in support of the UCC would be that Muslims as a community have a much larger Total Fertility Ratio as compared to the Hindus. One of the major reasons for that is polygamy, so how would the government make te entire country monogamous, without a UCC?\n\nIn an interview with Jordan Peterson, he was asked a similar question, about the relative TFRs of the Muslims and the non-Muslims living in America. It is typically 'assumed' in India that a higher fertility rate is a direct consequence of poverty levels, lack of education and awareness, and lack of belief in contraception, but strangely enough, that cannot be said about the Muslim community living in the US. Well certainly they can lag behind in a certain indices as compared to the other communities there, but they are certainly better than the Muslims living in India, and yet there is an issue of TFR there.\n\nWhich tells you that there are other motivations at play, and while this remains a subject of speculative research, the lack of understanding that such overpopulation has a direct impact on nature and its resources, and which could lead to strife, is something that needs to be impressed upon, by education or however.\n\nThe point is, you don't need to address the issue of polygamy and fertility from a UCC, you can simply do that from the standpoinrt of nature and population, and that would perhaps be a less communal way of going about it. Because ultimately, what is the point of holding on to religion when we are all hurtling towards the destruction of the planet?\n\nPopulation is something that needs to be addressed across the board, but if there is a targeted intent of inverting demographics, then there is always a mutually destructive competitive race. And that is something that has happened in Assam, Kashmir, and is happening in Kerala.\n\nNow, this may seem as a very outlandish thing to say, but identity politics plays a role even when it comes to overpopulation. The fear of being outnumbered, and then systematically cleansed, is perhaps one of the reasons for this competitive breeding that is going on. Remember, illegal immegration in India was handled by a civilisational and historical approach, and not a communal one, and thus that's what needs to be done when it comes to overpopulation and access to natural resources.\n\nI think it is difficult for a government to approach politics, population, culture and civilisation, each from a separate standpoint. It needs to have a certain narrative, and all other verticles neeed to be addressed within that particular narrative, to ensure that the narrative is consistent on all fronts.\n\nPS - My views echo and are largely influenced by those of Adv.

      <li>Title::: 'Social Media is destroying our political opinions'<br />Body: "Hello folks,\n\nI am a fairly lesser active user of social media sites but since the lockdown I have been using Reddit and Twitter a lot and I have to say that these sites just don't reflect the reality in any shape or form, they are becoming places where you select one side and have to virtue signal other sides to gain moral superiority.\n\nUnfortunately this concept of getting moral superiority is not restricted to select few internet trolls but some genuine reporters, celebrities and many many influential more people.\n\nIf you have a particular political opinion lets say RW, then you will only follow those accounts which promote BJP and its policies and bash opponents for no reason whatsoever. If there is any news which might be negatively affecting your political side you diminish it as fake or propaganda or worse attack the person exposing you for some of his/her political mistakes. The same also applies with LW people, even if the govt announces some genuine policies you try and nitpick the mistakes and shame the govt for being anti XYZ just for the sake of it.\n\nWe are a country with 135 crore people and guess what violence is going to occur everyday, there is no need to give each and every violent incident a communal spin and make it national news, case in point Palghar Sadhu incident and Tablighi Jamaat. Agreed even though both incidents are not identical why are we blaming Maharashtra govt for being anti hindu for Palghar incident, what is the logic?, why would any political party be anti 86% of population?. Similarly why do we need to blame all Muslims for a dumb decision taken by few hundred people. All such incidents are unfortunate and instead of making it a nation wide communal issue shouldn't we see the actual culprit and take legal action against him/her?\n\nI genuinely believe that social media is teaching us to blindly follow our political sides without being logical at all, we are being more Americanized in the wrong ways. Identity politics is damaging our country."<br />Author: 'ati_hushaar'  id: 'g4wt1o'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4wt1o/social_media_is_destroying_our_political_opinions/</li>

      <li>Title::: '‘Please allow us to return’, Indians stuck in the UAE during COVID-19 pandemic appeal to Modi'<br />Body: "  Indians stranded in the UAE and other foreign countries are appealing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow them to return home. India is one of many countries that has barred its own citizens oversea from returning, by imposing international travel bans, as the world deals with the novel coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19. Many Indians have taken to Twitter last week to request Modi to open international flights for repatriation of stranded citizens, and others have called out the Indian government on the earlier decision of not evacuate.\n\nVisa of some Indian migrant workers in the UAE have expired and some of them have laid off, but their home country is hesitating to take them back as there is a concern to do not have the capacity to place them in quarantine after their return. Spelling trouble for migrant workers, the UAE plans to impose restrictions on countries not responding to their citizen's evacuation requests. \n\nIndian Ambassador to the UAE, Pavan Kapoor, told on April 11 that the Indian government has taken the decision for the safety of Indians. ‘[Gulf News](https://gulfnews.com/world/covid-19-please-allow-us-to-return-indians-stranded-outside-the-country-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-appeal-to-prime-minister-modi-1.1586759914276)’ reported, adding that the country cannot take the risk of evacuating a large number of people from foreign countries while it is concentrating on breaking the chain of infection inside the country. The Indian government had “refused permission to chartered flight services even though some airlines were ready to operate special flights”. A petition seeking chartered flights to fly back Indians stranded in the UAE was also filed before the Supreme Court of India by the migrant welfare society Pravasi Legal Cell. \n\nA ministry official told UAE State news agency that options currently being studied by MOHRE include the halting of any memoranda of understanding between the Ministry and the concerned authorities of non-cooperative countries, as well as the introduction of restrictions or quotas for future recruitment. Although the UAE government has extended the validity of visas, stating that Indians who have an expired visa will be able to stay in the country without incurring penalties, authorities stressed the urgency of foreign countries assuming their responsibilities towards their nationals in the UAE wishing to return back home with their families during the pandemic. \n\nThe UAE ministry in cooperation with the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the General Civil Aviation Authority, and the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority, also launched a humanitarian initiative to enable residents working in the private sector to return to their home countries as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Indian mission in UAE said it is facilitating 3.4 million coronavirus-hit Indian ex-pats, lending a helping hand to many of them with accommodation, food, medicines, and counseling. Together with the Department of Health, UAE, the Indian Embassy is enabling alternative accommodation for COVID-19 positive ex-pats who are living in clustered shared accommodations. Kapoor told this in order to control the spread of the disease, but it’s not enough. Indian authorities should work immediately with UAE so that its citizens, who wish to do it, can come back home."<br />Author: 'MaddyKrish'  id: 'g4ucvc'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4ucvc/please_allow_us_to_return_indians_stuck_in_the/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hindus are already a minority in India'<br />Body: "Here is an idea worth considering. It may even sound outlandish to you - Hindus are already a politically weak minority in India. Hindus are not a monolith. We don't have one aasmaani kitaab to follow, nor a single prophet. We have a lot of variation within our loosely held together group identity. We are divided along, inter alia, caste, regional, and philosophical lines. We never have a consensus on any single issue. We have hitherto never voted on religious lines, and we had never voted strictly to safeguard our sense of identity.\n\nMuslims on the other hand are a strong group of approximately 20 crores. They have almost a uniform worldview, a cohesive group identity and a firm conception of what their interests are as a group. They have always voted collectively for anyone who would work for their communal interests, national interest be damned.\n\nMuslims are the largest minority, in a polity with no clear majority. They are the strongest group as far as safeguarding that group's interests is considered.\n\nTo use an analogy, Hindus are as varied from each other as different species of mammals are from each other in a forest. Muslims are the largest species of monkeys in this forest that contains many other mammal species of varied descriptions with no clear idea of unity. To decry Hindu majority is as stupid as propping up the idea of an oppressive animal majority against monkeys.\n\nThe problem with hindutva is that it is beginning to give your average Hindu (a much misused and distasteful term, as far as I am concerned), a sense of who they are and where they stand in a civilisational context. This is what has created so much chatter and chest thumping amongst those who relied on appeasing the largest political group in India, the Muslims, to make their political fortunes."<br />Author: 'ChYossarian'  id: 'g4s154'<br />Score:39<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4s154/hindus_are_already_a_minority_in_india/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Hindus will always continue to create internal enemies'<br />Body: 'All the philosophy apart, if we look at Hindu society and how it functions we will notice we as hindus exclude those who don\'t abide by culture. If you don\'t follow a practice, if you break an iron clad rule you are removed / abandonded. For example, if you were to marry a person from a different caste/religion in most places you will be excommunicated or shunned. Perhaps less so in Urban areas where you\'ll still find some people who will accept your choices. A lot of you would have faced this in a milder manner in some form or the other, like dating someone of a frowned upon caste or religion in family, opinions about not losing virginity, exclusion in religious practices due to personal choices, \n\nIndeed, this is observed in several other religions like Islam.  There are methods of forced integration via death threats or some form of aggression.  So, even if one were to have a different opinion or action, in most cases they are less likely to voice their view. A sordid state of affairs. \n\nOn the contrary, Hindus create this unfortunate circumstance for themselves. Someone who is different is excommunicated but is not as threatened for their choices (compared to other factions). They are kind of free to find their own way. They are still part of the general society. What happens to people such people? A lot of them accumulate rage and hatred and start rationing efforts to weaken, rather than critically empower the culture because they know in general they will seldom be killed for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do I suggest? Do we become more like islam or other more aggressive groups? While practically that is the most effective, morally and every other way it is bad, so no we shouldn\'t become aggressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRather, we need to educate society to be inclusive of newer differences that arise, which means - \\*\\*Do not throw them out\\*\\*.  \n\nWhile the religion itself preaches vasudaiva kutumbakam and inclusion, the society is far from it.\n\nEven the urban \'open minded\' people, when was the last time you heard them say "I accept you for who you are, for vasudaiva kutumbakam"?\n\nHindus will continue to create internal enemies since their way of dealing with the different is disowning your own.\n\nNow those who feel even partially disenfranchised are ripe with destructive intent.'<br />Author: 'metaltemujin'  id: 'g4p1wb'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4p1wb/hindus_will_always_continue_to_create_internal/</li>

AS A RULE, HINDU SADHUS, LEADERS ARE PAINTED AS TERRORISTS AND ANTI-SOCIAL ELEMENTS. \n*THE WHOLE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS HEAVILY FUNDED BY ANTI-HINDU ELEMENTS AND CONTINUOUSLY DOING HATE SPEECH FOR LAST 20 YEARS. \n*THE POISON THEY HAVE EMITTED AND BRAINWASHING THEY HAVE DONE, EVEN HINDUS ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE. WHEN I GREW UP, 99% PEOPLE WOULD WEAR HINDU SYMBOLS ON THEIR FOREHEAD, NOW IT IS 10%. PEOPLE ARE ASHAMED TO SHOW THEMSELVES AS HINDUS SADHUS ARE TERRORISED THEY HAVE TO CONSTANTLY LIVE IN FEAR. HINDUS, WAKE UP! JUST GETTING ONE JOB, GETTING MARRIED, TWO KIDS AND ONE HOUSE AND A GOOD SALARY IS NOT LIFE HINDU YOUTH IS GETTING BRAINWASHED. \n*A FEW COURAGEOUS PEOPLE WHO TAKE U SANYAS TO KEEP THIS ECOSYSTEM ALIVE ARE TERRORISED AND FACE LAWFARE, HATE SPEECH, POISONING AND FINALLY THEY ARE KILLED AND ELIMINATED. IN A FEW DAYS, NOBODY WILL REMEMBER THIS LYNCHIGN AND NOBODY WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THIS. I HAVE SEEN FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, NOT A SINGLE TERRORIST WHO HAS DAMAGED OUR PROPERTY OR KILLED OUR KAILASAVASI WILL BE PUNISHED.\n*POLICE SUPPORT THE BRAINWASHING GANGS AND CRIMINALS. SO MUCH ME AND MY SANGHA HAVE GONE THROUGH. THEY HAVE DONE TYAGA OF EVERYTHING AND TODAY AGAIN, TWO SADHUS AND ONE OF THEIR ASSISTANT DRIVER BELONG TO THE 13 AKHADAS. EVERY HINDU BRAHMACHARI, SANYASI, BALASANT SHOULD KNOW THAT THREE OF OUR BROTHERS - TWO SADHUS AND ONE GRIHASTHA - ARE KILLED IN MOB LYNCHING BRUTALLY.\n*I SINCERELY REQUEST, ‘ALL HINDUS, PLEASE WAKE U! LET US GET ATTENTION TO THIS HINDU HOLOCAUST HAPPENING CONTINUOUSLY IN INDIA.’\n*THIS ANTI-HINDU MEDIA IS NOT GOING TO STOP TILL THE LAST HINDU IS ELIMINATED. AND AFTER THEY KILL THE LAST HINDU, THE STORY WILL EB HE WAS RESPONSIBLE TO GET KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS ANTI SOCIAL. \n*O HINDU AND HINDU SADHUS! THE SAME TERRORIST GANG THAT KILLED THE SAME SADHU YESTERDAY WILL NOT KEEP QUIET. THEY WILL COME FOR YOU NEXT! \n*WHEN SHANKARACHARYA WAS ATTACKED ALL MUTTS THOUGHT, ‘LET US KEEP QUITE THAT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.’,WHEN SHAIVITE MUTTS,..WHEN ASHARAM BAPU WAS ATTACKED, OTHER ORGANISATIONS FELT IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM. THE SAME IS GOING TO ATTACK YOU TOMORROW!\n*IN YESTERDAY’S MURDER, THE MEDIA IS A LITTLE LATE. IT DID NOT HAVE TIME. IT IS CLEAR. FIRST THEY SHOW THEY ARE CRIMINAL AND THEN THEY WILL EXECUTEMMOB LYNCHING. THEY DIDN'T DILUTE EVENTHIS NEWS. THEY WILL TRY TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE AS THIEVES OR ANTISOCIAL ELEMENTS.\n*IT IS A CLEAR METHODOLOGY. HOW THEY MADE ASHRAMA BAPU ILLEGITIMATE BY PUTTING A FALSE CASE ON HIM. HIS WHOLE SANGHA WHICH IS A STRONG BACKBONE OF HINDUISM….IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE FALS CASE. THEY WERE CONTINUOUSLY ATTACKING HIM AND FINALLY THEY CAUGHT HIM IN ONE CASE. BY GRACE OF MAHAKALA BHAIRAVA OR PARAMSHIVE, I AM PROTECTED, ELSE THEY WOULD HAVE FINISHED ME LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY. KALABHAIRAVA GAVE ME THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON US IS A WAR. IT IS NOT A PROSECUTION, IT IS A PERSECUTION. \n*I REQUEST ALL MY DEVOTEES HUMBLY; PLEASE SPEND LITTLE TIME. LET US BRING INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO THIS CONTINUOUS LOB LYNCHING AGAINST HINDU SADHUS ADN LEADERS. IT IS CONTINUOUSLY HINDU HOOCAUST HAPPENING IN INDIA AND OTHER PARTS. IT IS NOT JUST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. U DO NOT KNOW HOW THE WHOLE AREA OF HINDUS. THEIR PROPERTIES ARE GRABBED.\n*EVEN NOW THE MEDIA IS TELLING THESE THREE ARE THIEVES BEATEN TO DEATH IN MAHARASHTRA. \n*THE ANTI-HINDU THINK THANK WILL CREATE …..FOR ME, THEY RELEASED A VIDEO SHOWING I AM A RAPIST. 4TH MARCH, THEY FILED A FALSE CASE THAT I AM PERVERTED. THEY RELEASE THE MORPHED VIDEO ON ME AND THEY SAY I HURT PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS! BRUTALLY THEY ATTACKED AND BURNT MY ASHRAMS EVERYWHERE. THE TERRORIST GANG PUSHED ME INSIDE THE TRADITIONAL THATCHED HUT, LOCKED THE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE AND THIS WHOLE THING WAS SHOWN LIVE IN TELEVISION. AND POLICE WAS STANDING NOT TO PROTECT ME BUT TO ENSURE MY SANSYAIS DONT PUT THE FIRE OFF. THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POLICE. POLICE ARE LITERALLY HANDING OVER ME TO THE TERRORIST GANG TO KILL ME. TWO OF MY SADHUS BROKE THE WINDOW USIGN THEIR BARE HANDS AND PULLED ME OUT THROUGH THE BACK SIDE AND SAFEGUARDED ME. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE IN FRONT OF YOU NOW SITTING AND TALKING TO ME. ELSE, ON MARCH 4TH THE NEWS WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED: DUE TO ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, HE GOT KILLED.\n*MAJORITY OF HINDUS DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A WAR GOING ON AGAINST THEM. ONE BY ONE THEIR LEADERS ARE GETTING ELIMINATED. THEY ARE BRAINWASHED BY THE MASS MEDIA CULT AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY CULT OF INDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA CULT OF INDIA, PRINT MEDIA CULT OF INDIA. THE HINDUS DON'T REALISE THE NEXT GENERATION IS NOT COMING UP FOR SANYAS. AND THE HINDUS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE MAINSTREAM HINDUS AND KILLED USING LAWFARE DEFAMATION AND ULTIMATELY MOB LYNCHING. ‘\nPOLICE USES MOB LYNCHING TO ELIMINATE HINDU SADHUS AND HINDU LEADERS. I CAN SHOW YOU PHOTOGRAPH AND VIDEOGRAPHY RECORDS AS EVIDENCE. IT WAS AN ORGANISED MURDER THAT WAS EXECUTED. THEY CAME WITH PETROL BOMBS AND OTHER ITEMS WHICH ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMMON MAN OR LOCAL VILLAGERS. IT WAS A PLANNED CONSPIRACY. THEY WERE BROUGHT FROM SOMEWHERE IN AN ORGANIZED VEHICLE WITH EXPLOSIVES AND EVERYTHING TO KILL ME. AND IT IS NOT SPONTANEOUS ANGER SHOWN AS A PROTEST AGAINST SOME INNOCENT ATTACK IT IS A PLANNED TERRORIST ATTACK I HAVE FACED THIS MULTIPLE TIMES IN MULTIPLE STATES OF INDIA - NORTH TO SOUTH, EAST TO WEST. \n*MEDIA IS IN THEIR HANDS. SO THEY WILL TEH STORY HOW THEY WANT. WHEN I MOVED OUT OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY  WAS ASKED, ;SWAMIJI, YOU MOVED OUT OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY. HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THEY WILL NOT REACH WHERE YOU ARE AND ELIMINATE YOU. THE PEOPLE TRYING TO KILL ME ARE INTERNATIONAL MAFIA. THEY CANNOT TWIST THE STORY, CHANGE THE NARRATIVE, AND TELL THAT I WAS ANTISOCIAL AND IMMORAL, AND THEREFORE I WAS KILLED. IF THEY KILL ME, THEY HAVE TO FACE THE LAW. AT LEAST THE WORLD WILL KNOW THE STORY. THAT IS WHY I MOVED OUT OF INDIAN SOCIETY. THAT IS WHY I MOVED OUR OF INDIAN SOCIETY. \n*I AM PROTECTED . I WILL BE ALIVE AT LEAST TO BRING THE ATTENTION OF THIS TO THE WORLD EVEN NOW, INDIAN POLICE WANT ME THERE NOT FOR PROSECUTION, BUT TO HAND ME OVER TO THE MOB. THEN THEY WILL SAY, ‘BECAUSE HE IS ANTI SOCIAL’ THEY KILLED ME. THAT POLICE OFFICER WILL GET PROMOTION. THE KILLERS WILL GET BIRIYANI AND A AFTER A FEW DAYS IN JAIL, THEY WILL BE CELEBRATED AS HEROES. \n*COURT IS ORDERING THAT I SHOULD HAVE MY PASSPORT AND FREEDOM TO TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD TILL THE CASES ARE DISMISSED. I KNOW LEGALLY THEY CANNOT CONVICT ME. BUT USING THE SYSTEM THE POLICE IS NOT RENEWING MY PASSPORT BECAUSE THEY WANT ME THERE TO KILL ME IN SOME MOB LYNCHING. WHAT CAN I DO? I HAVE NO WAY FOR JUSTICE. COURT IS SAYING I SHOULD HAVE MY PASSPORT BUT PASSPORT OFFICER SAYS THEY CANNOT RENEW! I MET THE TOP PASSPORT OFFICIALS IN BENGALURU! NO SOLUTION! EVEN IF I GET ANOTHER COURT ORDER, THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW THAT COURT ORDER! THEY JUST WANTED TO RETAIN ME IN INDIA TO FINISH ME OFF. I WILL APPEAR IN SOME PUBLIC PLACE OR OTHER RIGHT. AT THAT TIME THEY WILL CATCH ME AND HAND ME OVER TO THE MOB LYNCHERS. \n*O HINDUS WAKE UP! IF YOU STILL THINK INDIAN POLICE FOLLOW LAW AND ORDER, YOU ARE FOOL. YOU ARE BEING BRAINWASHED! I WILL SHOW YOU ENOUGH EVIDENCE.\n*13 AKHADAS FORM THE AKHADA PARISHAD OF WHICH JUNA AKHADA IS A PART. MEDIA IS TRYING TO FRAME THE TWO SADHUS AS CHILD LIFTERS AND THIEVES. EVEN IF THEY ARE THIEVES, TAKE THEM TO THE COURT AND DO INVESTIGATION! \n*WHOLE ECOSYSTEM - WHETHER POLICE OR MEDIA OR ANYTHING - IS TO TERRORISE AND DESTROY HINDUS.\n*WHEN WE RECOVERED, ALL THE ITEMS THE TERRORIST GANGS USED TO DESTROY AL LOF US - WERE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL ILAGE THEY PLANNED AND BROUGHT WITH THEM. \n*ALL MY DEVOTES DISCIPLES SADHUS SANYASIS PRACTISING AND LIVING HINDUS, PLEASE WAKE UP TO THIS TRUTH! INDIA NEEDS TO WAKE UP TO THIS TRUTH! O HINDUS, PLEASE WAKE UP. LET US BRING INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO THIS HINDU HOLOCAUST CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING.\n*BEFORE WE GO TO OUR DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES, LET US SPEND LITTLE TIME AND BRING THE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO THIS HINDU HOOCAUST HAPPENING. \n*AFTER A FEW OF MY SANYASIS SAVED ME FROM THE BURNING HUT POLICE AND MEDIA - THE TERRORIST MOB - ENTERED TO THAT AREA TO FIND MY DEAD BODY. WHEN THEY COULD NOT, THEY SAID, ‘O! HE IS A BLACK MAGICIAN!’\n*HINDU SADHUS AND LEADERS INSIDE INDIA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR VOICE. THEY WILL BE BRUTALLY ATTACKED AND KILLED. ONLY THE INTERNATIONAL HINDS NEED TO STAND UP AND BRING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND THIS HINDU HOLOCAUST HAPPENING IN INDIA AND OTHER NATIONS. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES. THE WAY WE HINDUS ARE BEING DISORGANISED...WE ARE MINORITY INSIDE INSIDE BECAUSE BY WE ARE DISORGANISED. MINORITY OR MAJORITY SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON NUMBERS BUT BY HOW MUCH WE ARE ORGANISED. WE ARE SMALL SMALL GROUPS, SO WE ARE MINORITY COMMUNITY.  \n*INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY INCLUDING UNITED NATIONS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS HINDU HOOCAUST AND MOB LYNCHING CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING.\n*I HAVE TO BE IN SO MUCH FEAR EVEN NOW TO UTTER EVERY WORD SO CAREFULLY BECAUSE WHAT SORT OF CASES THEY WILL FILE ON ME, I DON'T EVEN KNOW BECAUSE I AM GIVING VOICE FOR HINDUISM.\n*IF THREE SADHUS FALL, THE HINDUS SHOULD STAND UP AND AT LEAST 3000 PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE UP APATH SANYAS TODAY. THAT IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO KEEP HINDUISM ALIVE. ONLY THEN WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE REMAINS OF HINDUISM. IF WE ARE GOING TO BE TERRORISED, THEN THE ANTI-HINDU TERRORISTS ARE WINNING. \n*WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT OR NOT, THAT IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION. I WILL DO MY TYAGA IN EVERY POSSIBLE OF WAY. DEATH OF HINDUISM MEANS DEATH OF WHOLE SPIRITUALITY. ONLY THEN THE TERRORISTS WILL DECIDE TO BACK OFF. WE WILL NEVER KILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN NONVIOLENCE. BUT WE CAN MAKE A STATEMENT TO KEEP HINDUISM ALIVE WITH WILL PERSISTENCE AND TYAGA. TYAGAS IS THE ONLY ANTIDOTE FOR THIS CONTINUOUS PERSECUTION GOING ON. WE NEED TO BUILD A LARGE ECOSYSTEM OUTSIDE INDIA WITH PROTECTION. \n*ALREADY KAILASA HAS SIGNED THE TREATY WITH MANY NATIONS. ONE NATION HAS GIVEN US A LAND WITH AUTONOMOUS STATUS. WE AN HAVE OUR OWN LAW AND ORDER SYSTEM AS PER HINDU CONSTITUTION. THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE, BY KEEPING THE HINDU PRINCIPLES ALIVE LET US KEEP THE HUMANITY ALIVE AT LEAST OUTSIDE INDIA. \n*I WILL CONTINUE TO DO TYAGA. ANYONE CAN TAKE APATH SANYAS TO PRACTICE, PROTECT AND PROMOTE HINDUISM AND HINDU SCRIPTURES, YOU ARE WELCOME. PLEASE APPLY. FILL THE FORM ARE NITHYAHINDUUNIVERSITY.ORG/DAILYSATSANG. WITH THE GRACE OF PARAMASHIVA AND PROTECTION OF KALABHAIRAVA I ALREADY HAVE A SAFE HAVEN AND PLACE FOR HINDUS TOGETHER AND PRACTICE HINDUISM AND SHARE IT WITH THE WHOLE WORLD. \n*WITH THIS CORONA AND 144 IN INDIA, HOW DID SUCH LARGE SIZE MOB GATHER IN FRONT OF POLICE STATION AND KILL A SADHU? HOW MANY LEVELS OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION? THE PRIESTS ARE GETTING ARRESTED FOR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE GATHERING IN TEMPLES. AND 100S OF TERRORIST GANGS ARE GATHERING AND KILLING THREE SADHUS! AND THE MEDIA DOESN'T TALK ABOUT AY OF THIS. MEDIA SAYS, ‘THIEVES WERE KILLED.’\n*I HAVE NOT MADE KAILASA TO PROTECT ME, I HAVE MADE KAILASA TO PROTECT HINDUS, GURUKUL TRADIONTIN, PHILOSOPHY, LIFESTYLE, SPIRITUALITY THE ONLY HOPE FOR HUMANITY. HOW THEY MOB LYNCHED MY YOGINI SARVAJNA PEETHA IN GUJARAT. I MADE IT JUST FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN. HOW THEY DESTROYED THE SARVAJNA PEETHA! BUT MEDIA TWISTS AND GIVES AN ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT STORY. MEDIA AND GUJARAT POLICE DESTROYED. CLAIMING WEAR RUNNING PROSTITUITION  AND BROTHEL. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAN IN COURT, BUT THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DESTROYING THE GUJARAT SARVAJNAPEETHA!\n*I HAVE NOT EVEN VISITED THE GUJARAT YOGINI SARVAJNAPEETHA. I HAVE NOT EVEN VISITED GUJARAT FOR A LONG TIME, AND I HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM HUMAN SOCIETY FOR TWO YEARS, AND THEY ARE FILING A FALSE CASE ON ME IN GUJARAT! AND MY SANYASIS ARE STILL STUCK IN GUJARAT WITHOUT A PLACE BECAUSE OF THE BAIL CONDITIONS THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN THE JURISDICTION. \n*I HAVE A LOT TO SAY. I WILL CONTINUE TO SAY IN FURTHER SATSANGS."<br />Author: 'andreaskall'  id: 'g4nrul'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/g4nrul/hindu_holocaust_oh_hindus_wake_up_there_is_a_war/</li>
