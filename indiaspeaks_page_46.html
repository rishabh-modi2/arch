      <li>Title::: 'Letter to Government of India on GST and the latest 20% cap on input tax credit'<br />Body: "**Email to various government agencies on 20% cap on ITC in GST**\n\nRespected Sirs / Madams.\n\nWe have been wanting to write an email from a long time, but it's only now that are doing so. It is because we are forced to do this due to the severity of the issue pertaining to the input tax credit limit in the GST. This email, sent to various departments of the country, is nothing less than SOS by us from behalf of all the businesses of the country.\n\nWe through this email request immediate withdrawal of the notification of the 20% order restricting the ITC claimable on the GST.\n\nWhen GST was introduced. It was touted as Good and Simple Tax, both by the department and by the government. Unfortunately, inspite of our best efforts to believe so, that has not been the case. Infact, contrary to that, it's quite opposite to that.\n\nWe understand that both the tax department and the government are important pillars of our great country. Both are important in progress and development of this country and we continue and we will continue to support the cause of nation building by all the parties involved. It is, at the same time necessary that both the tax department and the government of India considers and remembers that businesses too form an important, employment generating, revenue generating and nation building pillar in this country.\n\nIt's however unfortunate that all the laws and rules in this country have seemed to have made, atleast in the views of many, with not enough consideration, respect and needs of ever so important businesses in our country. Sometimes even outright disregard for them and sometimes even causing major hurdles for them.\n\nGST, regrettably, is long turning out to be one of those laws of this country.\n\nWe understand the need for complete transparency and compliance of all the tax rules of our country, including of direct and indirect taxation, from all the citizens of the country who are lawfully eligible to comply to them.\n\nAt the same time, it's worth mentioning that businesses in this country have been hounded by tax laws which are draconian, overreaching, unfair. These type laws also contribute to the overall slowdown of the economy, hurting both the employment and the highly important businesses who employ them.\n\nThe latest notifications about GST are nothing less when it comes to bad laws. The notification dated 09.10.2019 of cap on just 20% extra claimable input tax credit is part of that.\n\nPlease let us give some idea and an example of what the businesses are facing in this country.\n\nTo understand the problems of businesses, please ask an actual businessmen on ground level. He will tell you the biggest problem is compliance and how tough it is. The biggest problem about compliance is billing and returns filing.\n\nLet us give you a very small but important example out of many.\n\nA business buys a lot of goods from many B2B sellers, completely on official GST bills, he shows all those bills, gets input tax credit for it. Now he waits for all those B2B sellers to upload the bills. Turns out, half of those sellers have not uploaded the bills. Half of those will do it after 3 to 6 months and many just don't want to. Now what will happen to the buyer. He has to go after that seller, keeping aside all the other things. Till now, he used to get input tax credit on all those non-uploaded bills but the new notifications have put an additional 20% cap on claimable value on the uploaded bills. Means, if the 30% bills are uploaded by all the sellers, the buyer cannot claim credit for more than 50% of input tax credit.\n\nNow one may ask what is wrong with that. We say everything. GST puts onus on the seller to upload the bills, but it gives no functionality for the buyer to upload the bills, yet, it forces the honest tax compliant buyer to burden the costs of the bills that the seller didn't upload. How unfair is that. It means the buyer has no option but to go after the seller pleading the seller to upload the bills (some of them upload it after a whole year).\n\nGovernment thinks a buyer can get rid of the seller if it's not uploading the bills. Please tell us how can a buyer get rid of a seller it's buying from years and years and his input tax credit worth thousands, if not lakhs, is struck with the seller after buying from them and then knowing that the seller is not uploading it.\n\nThe new GST e-invoice filing methods that are going to come only fixes the issues slightly. In it, we have heard that big sellers (above 5 crore turnover) need to validate bills online before giving them to the buyer. Means the bills will be validated first on the GST site and do not need to be re-uploaded online. Which is a welcome move. But most big sellers are always compliant. It's the sellers under 5 crore or 2 crore which cause problems.\n\nNow government wants to still burden the buyer. Instead, government needs to go after non-compliant sellers or anyone who is not uploading the bills for a start. They are going after those generating fake invoices to generate input tax credit but are not going after those are just not uploading bills or are uploading bills after 6 months to a year, with absolutely no care for compliance.\n\nNow this is not an isolated problem. This is a problem everywhere. A big number of B2B sellers are just not timely uploading the bills no matter what.\n\nNot only that, government wanted to get rid of non-compliant businesses but gives absolutely no easy option for the people to report them.\n\nThis is a ground level problem no one is talking about. How can businesses run like this.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of businesses file quarterly returns, now what can a small businessmen do for the 20% monthly limit if many of his sellers are quarterly filers.\n\nWe have been told that due to the 20% limit on ITC, some businesses, who's net profit might not even be 50 thousand rupees per month, have been told to pay 3 lakh rupees of GST!! That too for filing the GST just for the month of October 2019. This is utter shameful, disgraceful and unfair.\n\nThe new notifications limiting the ITC of 20% on GST for non-uploading of bills by the supplier is draconian, goes against the act of natural justice and is nothing less than tax terrorism.\n\nThe newer notification 123/42/2019-GST says that the limit is self compliant to GST payer, but ultimately, if the GST payer doesn't pay as per what the GST site is asking, he will have to pay penalties and might even get a notification from the tax department for non-compliance.\n\nWe regret to say this but if this limiting of ITC and the way GST is going forward continues like this then majority of the businesses of this country will be on streets, either with joblessness and poverty or in protests, that too not against the tax department and the government, which we all honestly and completely respect, but against these type of anti-business laws.\n\nWhile we as common citizens are in no standing to give suggestions to the tax department and the government, we will try to do so. This is why, we have suggestions to make. They are:\n\n1. Immediate withdrawal of the 20% limit of input tax credit claimable.\n2. A government level system to check where all businesses, especially B2B businesses which are uploading and filing bills on time. Notify those who aren't doing so.\n3. More concentration on those B2B sellers who don't upload and file GST on time.\n4. All bills by B2B, should be based on e-invoice and should be uploaded to the GST site first as per the new regime of GST that is going to come, only then the bills should be valid and considered a real payable bill.\n5. Not just big sellers above 1.5 crore or 5 crore, but all B2B sellers should be using this new e-invoice billing system.\n6. No limit on input tax credit claimable until the new regime of GST billing is enacted.\n7. All B2C sellers, which are among the largest employers in this country, shouldn't be harassed with tough to comply GST laws and no limit should be put onto them for claiming GST credit.\n\nThese are just some suggestions we think are required to be followed to help GST compliance and reduce the problems with GST in the country. We in no way suggest or support any harassment of any honest GST payer of the country.\n\nWe have long thought about writing to various officials. From finance ministry to finance secretary to even PMO. But time and again the government and it's respective parties come out with a new GST change that gives us hope that yes people at the helm are doing something to improve GST. Just like the new e-invoice filing methods we mentioned above. But the problem is, there are several big problems with GST, the one we have mentioned is just one of them. So we don't know where to even start writing all of them. If we do start writing about the issues, it might take us a long time to write all those issues, people reading would take even a longer time to read them, with us not being sure if people at the helm would actually do and if they do read them, if they are willing to implement, it will take even longer time to implement it.\n\nSo we have highlighted on the main issue at hand that is this 20% ITC limit notification.\n\nSo here is hoping that bigger experts than us, sitting in the government and tax department, who are trying to improve GST, who know more than we do, respect our suggestions and bring a good and improved GST acceptable to everyone.\n\nThanking you. A common businessmen of India."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'dxxl2p'<br />Score:44<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dxxl2p/letter_to_government_of_india_on_gst_and_the/</li>
      <li>Title::: "[Biweekly Geopolitics Thread] New Sri Lankan President, Bolivia's President resigns and flees, and the Indian Removal Act"<br />Body: 'Welcome to this week\'s edition of the Geopolitics Thread. Here, we discuss all the happenings from the rest of the world. Discussion topics do not have to be related to India. Here are a few stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India\'s neighbourhood:\n\n1. [Gotabaya Rajapaksa elected President of Sri Lanka](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-election/sri-lankas-premadasa-accepts-defeat-at-presidential-poll-steps-down-from-party-position-idUSKBN1XR06M)\n\nFormer Lt Col in the Sri Lankan Army, Defense Minister that oversaw the defeat of the LTTE, and brother of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa emerged victorious in the island nation\'s presidential election, defeating his rival Sajith Premadasa. Rajapaksa brings in a Buddhist-Nationalist policy that voters embraced in the wake of the April 2019 Easter bombings, but his first challenge will be to revive the country\'s debt-laden economy. His election campaign attracted controversy when it was revealed that he is still a US citizen.\n\n2. [Nawaz Sharif allowed to travel to London for treatment](https://www.news18.com/news/world/pakistan-court-allows-ailing-nawaz-sharif-to-travel-to-london-on-tuesday-for-medical-treatment-2389937.html)\n\nThe Lahore High Court cleared the way for jailed former Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif, whose blood platelet count reached dangerously low levels, to be taken for treatment to London by Air Ambulance. Sharif\'s name figured on the so-called Exit Control List, which prevents Pakistani citizens from leaving the country. The PTI government had insisted that Sharif furnish a bond of PKR 700 crore before being allowed to leave, but the court rejected that upon an undertaking from his brother that he would return once doctors certified that he was fit again. \n\n3. [Hong Kong university erupts into violence](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/11/17/hong-kong-protesters-shoot-arrows-police-violence-intensifies/4222011002/)\n\nHong Kong Polytechnic University, which has emerged as the last holdout for pro-democracy protesters in China\'s autonomous region, erupted into violence as police entered the campus to enforce an evacuation order. Students fought back with bows and arrows, gasoline bombs, and bricks, causing a dangerous situation. The city\'s administration cancelled all schools for the third business day in a row. While protests began in HK to oppose an extradition bill with mainland China, the demands have increased since then, calling for a rollback of Communist Party influence and an investigation of police brutalities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the rest of the world:\n\n1. [Leftist Bolivian President ousted from power](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50399640)\n\nBolivia\'s President Evo Morales (one of the few South American leaders from the indigenous population) resigned the country\'s presidency after weeks of protests against a controversial and tainted election. Morales claims that he stepped down to avoid bloodshed, but maintained the legitimacy of his election. He has left for Mexico, where he continues to fight to reclaim his position. Meanwhile, right wing senator and fierce critical of Morales,  Jeanine Áñez, assumed the presidency after legislators from Morales\' party resigned en masse. Pro-Morales demonstrations continue, turning violent at times. \n\n2. [Trump impeachment proceedings begin public phase](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-warns-trump-not-to-intimidate-whistleblower-youre-in-my-wheelhouse)\n\nThe impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump assumed a public phase, with witnesses being called in over Trump\'s alleged use of US military aid to Ukraine to investigate leading Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son. A complaint from a whistleblower sparked the impeachment proceedings, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warning the President not to retaliate against him. Meanwhile, former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified even as President Trump attacked her in real-time on Twitter. Democrats have accused him of witness intimidation as a result, but Trump maintains that he has the right to speak freely. \n\n3. [Israel strikes Islamic Jihad terrorists in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-escalation-islamic-jihad-intl/index.html)\n\nIsrael launched a series of air strikes in the densely-populated Gaza strip, killing 26 people including 17 terrorists and a seven-year old boy. The terrorists are from a group called the Islamic Jihad, the second-largest terrorist group there after Hamas. The fighting was caused when the terrorists launched over 100 rockets into Israel, forcing people to evacuate into bomb shelters. The rockets were in retaliation to Israel killing the leader of the group, Baha Abu Al-Ata. The group has demanded that Israel cease its killing of Palestinian terrorist leadership as a condition to a ceasefire. Caretaker PM Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting till rocket strikes from Gaza stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Indian Removal Act of 1830\n\nThe European colonization of the Americas was a significant event in modern history. Euro-centrist historians often describe those lands as pristine and untouched, but nothing could be farther from the truth, for North America was home to thousands of indigenous tribes. European colonizers dealt with those indigenous tribes - called "Indians" because they thought the land was actually India - in various ways. The Spanish chose to Christianize them and intermingle, while the British preferred to deal with them as sovereign nations. When the United States was formed as the first sovereign nation in the Americas, they inherited the question of dealing with the tribes. \n\nAnd they dealt with them, often badly. In the Northern territories of the new nation, Indians were largely wiped out as a result of disease and wars. But they remained in sizable numbers in the Southern states, particularly the five so-called "civilized" tribes that had assimilated significantly: the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee-Creek, Seminole, and the Cherokee Nations confederacy. American leaders, starting right from George Washington, favoured assimilating the tribes by Europeanizing them, but that process went much slower than expected. In the US constitutional scheme, the Indian nations were sovereign and dealt directly with the Federal government - which was a problem for the states, which lacked jurisdiction on Indian lands but coveted them for agriculture. \n\nThe southern states, particularly the largest of them, Georgia, did not have the patience for assimilation. They wanted the Federal government to remove the tribes altogether. This push was exacerbated by the US Supreme Court\'s Johnson v M\'Intosh decision, where it declared that Indians could live on lands in the US but could not legally own it. Meanwhile, the US continued to increase its territory by annexing lands West of the Mississippi river, even though a bulk of the population lived East (which is true to this day). Both of these came to a head with the election of President Andrew Jackson, who wanted Congress to give him the power to force the tribes to relocate to federal reservations West. He saw it as a merciful thing to do: the destruction of the tribes was inevitable, he argued (as was demonstrated in the north), and the only way for them to survive was to be relocated.\n\nIn 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the President to immediately negotiate with the tribes to vacate their lands and move to reservations in the West. Jackson and his successor enforced the policy vigorously, forcing tribes to cede their territories and be relocated: sometimes peacefully, sometimes by war, but always with the death of thousands. This forced relocation is called the \'Trail of Tears\' today, marking the trail the Indians followed, where about a quarter of them (about 13,000) died before reaching their new lands. This was enforced by state and local militias, in addition to the federal government. The Cherokee nations, the largest of the tribes, suffered particularly badly in what historians today describe as death marches. \n\nA century later, back in the Old World of Europe, a failed painter in Austria drew inspiration from the American conquest and near-genocide of indigenous peoples. This man, seeped in thoughts of racial purity,  praised the Americans for having “gunned down the millions of Redskins to a few hundred thousand” to establish a racially pure state. When he became Chancellor of Germany, he led a policy to expel those he saw as outsiders out of his expanding country, just as Jackson had achieved. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from across the world caught your attention?

We teach Sanskrit as a living tradition. This is in recognition of the fact that many of our students have backgrounds in Indic religions and Indian cultural practices, including yoga, art, music, dance and song. As a living tradition, we believe that the reception of language (especially the ability to read), should be balanced with its production (writing, speaking, chanting and singing). With this in view, each weekly unit has three parts: 1. simple Sanskrit conversational patterns, 2. a verse from the oral tradition, and 3. the all-important grammar section. The grammar is based on the textbook Introduction to Sanskrit by Prof. Thomas Egenes. Each week includes introductory videos, audio files to help you with correct pronunciation, and an audio commentary on the text book.\n\n&gt; By the end of the course, you will be able to conduct a coherent conversation on a range of simple topics, you be able to chant accurately twenty-six well-known verses, and you will have a good grasp of all the most common grammatical forms, so that you are ready to begin reading simple narratives.'<br />Author: 'calmag909'  id: 'dxknce'<br />Score:91<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dxknce/psa_if_anyone_is_interested_in_learning_sanskrit/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Comic Con India - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.'<br />Body: "TL;DR - My honest thoughts and opinions on India's take on the festival of pop-culture, Comic Con.\n\nTo begin with, I'd like to give you some of my own context in regard to my experience with Comic Cons in general. Since a young age, I have been fascinated by the idea of characters from my favorite pieces of entertainment coming to life. It started with video-games which had its merchandises available in stores. I'd always beg my parents to get me something (anything) which I can hold as a physical object outside of what I played, watched or read. As I grew up, I came across people who were equally passionate about such things - collecting toys, stickers, illustrating their art for the love of a franchise, you name it! This became a big part of me and I was overjoyed when I discovered the concept of Comic Cons. India, however, was a little behind and did not have an official presence in the Comic Con and it wasn't until 2011 that we had our first one.\n\nSince my family loves to travel, we have had the fair share of travelling across few European Countries and few Asian parts (Malaysia and Singapore) where Comic Cons are considered to be a big deal. Of course, not as big as places like San Diego Comic Con, but yeah, you get the idea. I have been to a few Comic Cons abroad and here's how they shift their focus - bringing life to any sort of pop-culture with costumes, merchandise and events. That... has been the crux of Comic Cons across the globe. Simple, right? Yes, let's talk about India now.\n\nThe Good - In the initial years of Comic Con India, I saw some amazing dedication to simple things. Families dressed up as their favorite cartoons (hello Cartoon Network!) even though people had minimal effort put into their cosplay, it was something. I saw a constant rise in discussions about pop-culture and what people 'would do for the next Comic Con'. Couldn't be happier. My girlfriend and I went as Hector and Imelda soon after the release of Coco; and the responses we received were the most heartfelt and beautiful compliments we have ever received. Its amazing how happy you can make people by breathing life into their loved movies, games and books. So, as the years passed, you could see how involved people were getting and every year people looked forward to Comic Con.\n\nThe Bad - Its not a new concept for Indians to capitalize on anything the moment they set their eyes on. Maybe its a genetic concept built into humans in-general, but we Indians do it better. Sure, there has been a rise in the productions for certain artists and illustrators who set-up their stalls and sell their pieces... which has become repetitive over the years. I am not saying that people aren't coming with anything new; as a Design student, I do observe patterns in design which sells. Other than your classic, cliche Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Friends merchandise, its becoming tougher to sell newer/off-beat stuff because that's what the majority of us want to spend on.\n\nThe Ugly - It breaks my heart to see how commercialized Comic Con has become. I am not sure about the other cities, but I can bet its almost similar elsewhere. The moment I entered the gates, there were at least 7 different companies/brands advertising their products. I am seeing this shift in the very concept of Comic Con - from being a convention which celebrates pop-culture and love of fictional worlds to becoming a place for people to promote and sell their brands. Its not just this thought though - what surprises me is that Comic Con India has a list of 'guests' who come and perform for audiences. Mind you, they have nothing to do with Comic Con. If I wanted to watch a new guy do his stand-up routine, I'd happily attend an Open Mic.\n\nAs much as I love the fact that Comic Con spreads awareness with regard to new Tech, happenings in Pop-Culture and welcomes people to live as their favorite characters for a day, it hurts to see it becoming so commercialized, instantly killing the mood and meaning of a convention.\n\nHope you guys think and reflect on this. Peace out!"<br />Author: 'tanaysharma97'  id: 'dxi8g2'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dxi8g2/comic_con_india_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly/</li>

And India disagrees with China's support of Pakistan. But one of the common things that both India and China can agree on (I hope) is that whatever happens in Kashmir, or in Hong Kong, is an internal matter. The United States, or Europe, or anyone else, have no business getting involved. \n\nThis is a potential common ground that Indians and Chinese can agree with. What would happen if Chinese start pushing back against any Western narrative on Kashmir. and Indians start pushing back against any Western narrative on Hong Kong? \n\nIndians who believe that they can find common ground with the British or Americans to fight China are delusional. Anglo-Saxons who hate Chinese people also hate Indian people. We have this in common. So instead of expecting India to be subservient to China or China to be subservient to India, why not recognize everybody's mutual interest?\n \n**The Anglo-Saxon West have no business interfering in Asian internal matters**.\n\nWhen White people criticize India, Chinese folks will support India's right to address its internal issues.

      <li>Title::: 'Here are 10 powerful statements made by columnist Sunanda Vashisht at Human Rights Commission hearing on Kashmir'<br />Body: 'In an unrestrained attack against the radical Islamic terrorism that has plagued the state of Jammu and Kashmir for more than 3 decades, noted columnist Sunanda Vashisht poignantly recounted the excruciating tribulations and horrors suffered by the minority Kashmiri Hindus in the state at the hands of radical Islamic terrorists.\n\n*Here are the 10 powerful statements made by Sunanda Vashisht that held back no punches-*\n\n# 1. My father is a Kashmiri Hindu. My mother is a Kashmiri Hindu. I’m a Kashmiri Hindu. Our home and lives in Kashmir were destroyed by radical Islamist terror\n\nBorrowing the last sentences said by Jewish American journalist Daniel Pearl before being killed in Pakistan by terrorists-“My father is a Jew, My mother is a Jew, I’m a Jew”, columnist Sunanda Vashisht expressed how the lives and homes of thousands and lakhs of Kashmiri Hindus were destroyed by the radical Islamic terrorism in the Valley.\n\n# 2. I’m a member of the minority Kashmiri Hindu community and a victim of the worst ethnic cleansing witnessed in India\n\nTalking about the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits happened in the early 1990s, Vashisht poignantly asserted that the mass departure of the minority community of Kashmiri Hindus from the Valley was the “worst ethnic cleansing witnessed in India” ever. About lakhs of Kashmiri Hindus fled the state and took refuge in other parts of the country. Those who didn’t perished in the onslaught of the violent Islamic terrorists.\n\n# 3. We have seen ISIS level of horror and brutality in Kashmir 30 years before the West was even introduced to the brutalities of Islamic terrorism\n\nSpeaking at the Tom Lantos HR commission, Sunanda contended that the people of India, especially the beleaguered Kashmiri Hindus had witnessed the horrors and atrocities inflicted by Islamic terrorists in Kashmir 3 decades ago that were tantamount to the present-day brutalities meted out by the ISIS.\n\n&gt;I am choked by the thoughts of those voices that I represent here because their voices were extinguished in the most brutal fashion.\n\nSunanda narrated the frightening story of Girija Tikoo, who was abducted, gang-raped and split in half with a mechanical saw while she was alive just because of her faith.\n\nIn another heart-rending incident, She then remembers BK Ganjoo. Another Kashmiri Hindu who was murdered brutally at the hands of Islamic terrorists in Kashmir. He was an engineer who hid inside a rice container and would have still been alive had his neighbours, who he trusted, Hindus trusted, did not give up his location. He was shot through the container and his wife was made to eat the blood-soaked rice, remembered Sunanda.\n\n# 4. Where were the Human Rights activists on the night of January 19, 1990, when all the mosques in Kashmir blared that they wanted Kashmir with Hindu women but without the Hindu men\n\nSunanda said that the mosques in Kashmir on the night of January 19, 1990, sent a shiver down the spines of minorities as they blared that they want Kashmir with Hindu women but not with Hindu men.\n\nSunanda gave an account of her own story when her grandfather held two knives in his hands, ready to kill her and her mother just to save them from the fate that awaited them if they were captured alive by the radical Islamic terrorists who had proceeded on their nefarious design to expunge the state of its Hindu minorities.\n\nSlamming Human Rights activists, who champ at the bit of accusing Indian Armed Forces of carrying out brutality against Kashmiri people, Sunanda rhetorically questioned their absence when she and her co-religionists were being killed, massacred and thrown out of Kashmir.\n\n# 5. Every attempt is made to eradicate Hinduism from Kashmir\n\nThe Islamic terrorists and their sympathisers in the valley, Sunanda asserts, have done everything in their power to stymie the multi-faith composite culture to spawn in Kashmir. Not only Hindus, but people practising other faiths such as Sikhism and Christianity were also targeted by the rabid Islamists.\n\n# 6. An Islamist state of Kashmir where no other religions are welcomed and tolerance of any other view is absent is no citadel of Human Rights\n\nTaking a dig at Human Rights activists and those who cite Kashmir as a bastion of secularism, Vashisht asserted that the Islamic State of Kashmir is a place where other religions are not accepted and there is no tolerance towards people with diverse views.\n\n# 7. Earning livelihood is prohibited in Kashmir because a simple act of earning livelihood will indicate that Kashmir is moving towards normalcy\n\nCiting the recent violence, Sunanda said that the terrorists in Kashmir are unnerved by the fact that normalcy prevailing in Kashmir will detrimental to their propaganda. Sunanda said that traders, Apple orchard owners and shopkeepers were killed by terrorists because they dared to earn their livelihood and wanted normalcy to return in the Valley.\n\n# 8. Abrogation of Article 370, which has raised concerned across the world, is in fact, restoration of Human Rights\n\nThe Human Rights in Kashmir were so far curtailed because Article 370 was in force, Sunanda argued. Kashmir was brought at par with the rest of India with the annulment of Article 370. Prohibition to child marriage, women’s right to own property, granting equality to members of the LGBTQ community were achieved after the abrogation of Article 370.\n\n&gt;Today I am delighted that Kashmiris have the same rights as Indian citizens. If something as serious as a woman’s right to own property and granting of LGBTQ rights to choose amongst many others, has been accomplished through abrogation of Article 370, then it is safe to assume that restoration of the Internet in few remaining districts of Kashmir is not too far away.\n\n# 9. The Indian Constitution, which is modelled on the US Constitution, is one of the most liberal documents in the world\n\nExtolling India’s constitution, Sunanda Vashisht said that the constitution of India is the Moselle on the constitution of the United States and is one of the most liberal documents in the entire world. She further added that this constitution, which was being obstructed from being applied in entirety in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, is now put into practice in totality after the revocation of Article 370.\n\n# 10. People of Jammu and Ladakh have been liberated from the tyranny of having citizens of their own country after the abrogation of Article 370\n\nSunanda Vashisht proclaimed that the people of Jammu and Ladakh have welcomed the decision of the government to invalidate Article 370. She implied that a large section of the population of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir state was happy with the central government’s decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[***OpIndia***](https://www.opindia.com/2019/11/sunanda-vashisht-usa-human-rights-commission-hearing-congress-10-statements/)'<br />Author: 'AmbivertPianist'  id: 'dx3wjo'<br />Score:108<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dx3wjo/here_are_10_powerful_statements_made_by_columnist/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'There has been a rise of propaganda against Kashmiri Pandits and we must address it firmly...'<br />Body: 'After the 370 Abrogation fiasco and the months of blackout that followed it, there has been considerable efforts to throw light on the Kashmiri Pandit Exodus issue on an international level, due to which some scumbags are now trying to peddle propaganda against the KPs. Some common things in their propaganda-comments/posts include :~\n\n\n1. Repeatedly bringing up Jammu riots of 1947, which is irrelevant to the topic because it was one of the many violent incidents which happened during Partition and cannot be used as an argument to discuss the Kashmir issue stemming from the 1980s (approximately 30 years after 1947).\n\n\n2. Downplaying the atrocities committed against KPs and "comparing" the number of lives killed in the Exodus with other incidents like the Godhra riots, this "comparison" is tasteless and disgusting to the core.\n\n\n3. Downplaying the role of common Kashmiris in the KP Exodus, while it is well-known that the common Kashmiris did nothing to prevent the Exodus, and in some ways, even facilitated the terrorists/separatists to drive out the KPs.\n\n\n4. Downplaying the role of religion in the whole Kashmir fiasco. KPs were driven out because they were infidel-Hindus, and not because they were the "privileged" section of Kashmiri society(this "privilege" is itself a vague argument). As simple as that. No convuluted-yet-stupid arguments can prove otherwise.

Trying to hide that fact that many, and I mean a LOT of KPs are still living in rundown refugee-camps, as if they were *illegal immigrants* or something.

But you all have Internet, search it up, the sources are just a few clicks away.\n\n\n\nHelp the KPs in bringing light to the atrocities committed against them.

      <li>Title::: 'Why caste system still goes strong. IMO'<br />Body: "So I had an interesting conversation with the domestic help at my house. She informed us she is going to be on a hiatus for 2 weeks, so we simply asked her to talk to the domestic help who also comes to the society and works 3 doors away. And the conversation went this way;\n\nMy mom: Suman*Ben please ask the other cleaning lady working in flat 308 to come to our house so that we can ask her to fill in while you are gone. It would be a great help.\n\nSumanben: (seemed very insulted) I don't talk with her, I'm a Kshatriya, she is a BC (yes that's how they refer so called 'backward classes' our side of the city)\n\nMom and me both were surprised. A couple days later mom said to me this;\n\nMom: you know that cleaning lady we asked suman Ben to talk too? I met her just at the gates of our society so offered her sumanbens job. She said yes, and I  talked about what Sumanben said about her. She replied that she knew who Sumanben and her family were, said they live in the chawl right next to her. I inquired more and she said both their husbands drive a rickshaw in the same route but no one from Sumanbens chawl talk to people from her chawl.\n\n\nAnd that's when I started thinking, like see both the women were from similar economic situation, lived next to each other, similar jobs of their husbands, must face same day to day problems and situation. Then why was Sumanben still so adamant on implying she is superior and the other cleaning lady is lower than her?\n\nI concluded that all of us want others to respect us, want to create a large view of us. Only two ways to achieve that as far as I know.\n1) respect by achievement: to actually accomplish something in life so that people recognise your hardwork or intelligence or strength character and respect you for that.(the hard way)\n\n2) respect by association: my father is rich, I am the MLAs nephew, I know the rich guy who drives a Mercedes, I belong to an upper caste, that is why you need to respect me. (The easy way)\n\nHumans are going to keep taking the easy way to assuage their egos and feel superior to others without putting in the hardwork needed to achieve true respect and standing in society.\n\nSorry for the long post😅 I know it may seem simplistic and stupid to some of you."<br />Author: 'ayushdesaidakleindia'  id: 'dwqq93'<br />Score:51<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dwqq93/why_caste_system_still_goes_strong_imo/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Discussion - How do you feel about the urban private healthcare, specially for pregnancy.'<br />Body: "Hey everyone!\n\nWhat are your opinions about private healthcare, specially when it comes to pregnancy? I am aware that there aren't many girls/women on this sub, and far less married/pregnant, but maybe the fathers here can share their experiences with their wives' pregnancies and deliveries.\n\nI work in a tier 2 city, far away from hometown. Our country has been witness to massive changes in the past decades. Say for example, my mother got married when she was 23, had my elder sister within 1 year; while I had just completed my engineering degree when I was 23 and was hunting for a job. There has been a visible change in the age of getting married, family planning, age of having the first kid, number of kids, etc for urban women, more so for the working ones. My sister had her first kid when she was 29. I hope you get the gist. \n\nNow this has obviously bought a change in the maternity medical scene as well. Up until 2005 (I would've been 14), listening about somebody having a baby via a C-section was really rare whereas today, it is more or less the norm. My female cousins, wives of my male cousins, my own sister, SIL, neighborhood ladies, etc have only had C-sections barring 1 or 2. When I try to think positively, I attribute this to more women having kids later now, I would say after 27-28 years of age. On not so positive days, I totally consider this to a money-making tactics by modern corporate hospital chains (Max, Fortis, Apollo, etc) When one has to make a quick call, whether to go for an operation or not, one cannot leave things to speculation (what-ifs) and mostly people yield to the hospital's advice. How many of those C-sections are warranted, there's no way for the mother or her kins to determine, unless someone extremely close to you, whom you blindly trust, is a doctor.\n\nI might be a little paranoid here and seeming to dump a lot of unjustified blame on doctors and hospitals, but I don't mean that at all. I just want to (hopefully) not be under the supervision of one such hospital/doctor who just views me as a cash cow. We also don't have such websites/forums/resources where mothers or family post reviews of the OB/GYN they visited, their overall experience, clarity of the situation explained by the doctor before suggesting C-section so that the family knows they're taking an informed decision, etc. Reddit's crowdsourced list of OB/GYN lists only 2 doctors in my city and I've not heard good things for them from local people's personal experiences. Hard luck I guess.\n\nThis turned out to be longer than expected. So, what can you people share about your experiences with deliveries?"<br />Author: '2throwawaythrowaway'  id: 'dwppbk'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dwppbk/discussion_how_do_you_feel_about_the_urban/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Sharing what I experience in swiggy working as a delivery boy.'<br />Body: "So I decided last month to work in swiggy as a delivery boy to earn some cash to buy few of my art supplies , but later just within 3 days I found myself to be in a situation where I realise that this is a company which dosen't care about delivery boy nor the customer and not even any restaurant and all they are trying to do is to earn more and more money by fooling all these three wheels on which swiggy runs itself. \n\nCheating delivery boy\n- they are saying that you can earn 30,000 every month if you work as a delivery boy with this tagline 'Be your own boss'  but I want to tell you that is an absolute lie only few delivery boys earn this much by working all day 10+ hour everyday with no holiday and on above you have to pay for the petrol and maintenance of the bike.  Look at there there ugly practices they say you will get incentive of 290r in a day if you can earn 1400r in a day by delivering ,conditions are you will have to log in the zone for 10+ hour and if you didn't get any order during that time  the company will give you 400r just to be login , sound very helpful right, but what others and I've notice is this that they will give you only the orders that you can only earn above 400r and below 900r and not more than that ,since they have a lot of delivery boys and a lot of orders every second ,they exploit the delivery boys just to show in the market that they are pretty big and want to serve people .  There are more things to speak about the condition of delivery boys here and how are they getting exploit by the company practices but I know most of you people can counter argument it ,and I don't want to waste my time with that. (In reality you can only earn 13+15k in a month by working 10+ hour every day ,they make sure of it ,since they have a lot of delivery boys they distribute the money and orders in a very precise way to every delivery boy) \n  \nMoving on \n\nCheating customers \n- In my 3 days of experience what I notice was swiggy dosen't care about the customer satisfaction and keeping them on this illusion that  'we hear you and we know what you want' . Sharing one of my experience with the customer ,So the last order which I did and the reason because of which I decided to quit the job was one day again I had to went out of my zone to pick up my order (because I can't decide and only company can decide which order will pop up on my screen) during that time at the restaraunt (or you can say illusion of restaraunt ,I will explain it later) when I was there to pick up my order (2orders to 2seperate places) the auditor decide to stop there me in my working time and start to teach me some lessons and rules which I was not following and trying to humiliate me in front of other ,which I tolerate in a way . See guys if you're order get delayed it's never the fault of the delivery boys , it can be traffic ,roads and other bullshit reason like this . so because I had 2 orders with me I had to travel more to two separate places , then I deliver the first one and later when I went to the second place the customer she got really angry with me and she told me that she is going to complain about it to swiggy , and I told her she can do whatever she like to do because I know it's not my fault ,I was just trying to do my job as quick as possible. Later when I went back to the restaraunt to talk to the auditor he said something like this.  \nMe: Sir me jaha order dene gaya tha wo customer bahot he galat tareke se mujse bat kar rahi thi aur bol rahi thi ke mere complain karne ja rahi hai swiggy se ,par mere esme kya galti hai . \nHim : koi bat nai tu bas bol dena ke traffic me fas gaya that(which is a lie) aur agar phir bhi na mane to bolna ke complain kar do , vaise bhi complain mere pas he ayege to me dekh lunga.\nThese words of him really surprise me and I was in a shock that how can you do this with the customer at least I can understand that company  do not pay much attention to the low class worker but this kind of attitude with the customer ,is it right ? What are you trying yo do here exactly I become curious that time.  I know a lot of you business people will think its ok and that's how the world works , to them I have to say have some shame , you are doing something which you don't even care about what are you a monkey?? doing all kind of stupid things all day and go to sleep in night to forget. Have some shame .\n\nCheating restaraunt \nNow after when I really become curious about the agenda of the swiggy ,I started to inspect it by myself, and what I've notice was something that none of us really know about , it is all business guys they don't care about the restaurants not the customer and specially not the delivery boys , what I've notice was they have many restaurants with different names under them and they maintain the delivery status order timing and every thing else very well and they do it by learning from all the data that they gather from customer other restaurants and delivery boys ratings. You people understand this idea that we understand things better only in comparison ,so they have some bad res. also on there app so that you can compare them on rating basis and fall under there trap by ordering from there res. Since they know how to manage all the customer demands in time , but you people can see right on what cost all this is happening right.  It is like amazon basics , first they learn from the customer and company and then they built there own brand , this is what swiggy and other food delivery companies are trying to achieve ,but again I ask on what cost? If you guys don't know then they take 25% from the restaraunt on every order and the restaurant dosen't have any clue that they are degrading there own brand and giving these companies res. a nice image built on all devil methods. \n\nThere are more things that I can speak here shout these companies and what I realise within 3 days of working, but my agenda is not that I want to aware people who innocent and stupid to fall in this kind of trap of the company whether it is the delivery boys or the customer or the restaraunt owner, have some dignity and stop all these western way of living we all are already much evolve country and we don't have to depend on these devil companies to serve us , you can never know there intentions.  Customers find a local person who knows how to cook good and hygienic food or help him to grow its business because these companies will eat him and you up.  So I quit my job and they didn't even pay me a single rupee after working for them for 20+ hour while doing 30+ deliveries because you know those conditions written in a small sizes.  Well I don't care about it but all I want is a sensible India which no devil method can penetrate it . If anyone have to say anything against what I 've mention here then you must go and die because really your life is not serving any good purpose here.

He alleges with no proof (as far as I know) that the BJP wants to demographically change Kashmir with "Indians" (as if Indians = Hindus and all Hindus = pro Modi) and sell off the pristine lands to crony capitalists who have been funding their campaign. He said this in a matter-of-fact way with no proof to back it whatsoever.\n\n2. With the militant character of Pakistan acknowledged (while also alleging Pakistan sponsored terrorists maybe RSS propaganda, /r/enlightenedcentrism much?), they go into the topic of Pakistani atrocities which was completely sidelined into a rhetoric of how India reacted to the 1988 revolution in Kashmir, where the Islamic and Jihadists sentiments were whitewashed. There was no mention of  Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami, al-Badr and Jaish-e-Mohammad insurgent factions that were destroyed by Operations in 1990. \n\n3. Addressed Pakistan\'s propaganda in Kashmir but understated the real impact it really had on the Jihad uprising.\n\n4. He defines Kashmir as a pluralistic society in light of *Naya Kashmir*, a manifesto for the social and economical development of Kashmir submitted to Raja Hari Singh. He goes on to claim that Kashmiris are angry at India for failing them to which I have found no sources, as many Kashmiris are [relieved and content](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kashmir-diaries-part-2-hoping-for-equal-opportunities-say-supportive-kashmiris-1596288-2019-09-06) of the abrogation of Article 370.\n\n5. After mentioning India\'s role in events that occurred in Mizoram, Manipur, Hyderabad, Goa where insurgents were quelled and heavy military force was implemented at times needlessly by the then Congress party, he goes on to state that the Congress party "set the template" for BJP which, unlike Congress (who were "secular" and what not), gives preference to only Hindus which is utterly false and misleading in every sense of the word. There has been no legislation passed that profits Hindus while diminishes anyone else.\n\n**6.** There was also the presence of a very strong anti-Hindu narrative suggesting India did to Kashmir what British did to India which is wrong on so many ways its almost sad seeing it come from a professor\'s mouth. He goes on to show the Hindus in a negative light while ignoring any aggressive moves, threats or outright act of violence from certain minorities. Slandered RSS with lies claiming RSS members\' objectives is to harass individuals of other beliefs "to feel empowered" which is ironic because [RSS has a Muslim Wing](http://www.muslimrashtriyamanch.org/) and have been involved in rescue operations, participated in land reforms and reforms in caste system. \n\n**7. While retelling the history of Kashmir, the Pundits or their massacre was not included**\n\nI did enjoy some of his claims and statements about Kashmir being a conduit of peace that links India to Pakistan and acknowledged some of the brutal force India used under Congress to quell insurgencies, but he clearly had an anti-Hindu, anti-RSS agenda here by mischaracterizing or otherwise ignoring context of some events and using that to construct his argument. \n\n\n\n\n\nLots of his explanations lacked the necessity backstory, which I don\'t blame him for since he had a time constraint, but nevertheless his agenda as mentioned above was clear.\n\n\n\n**https://youtu.be/6WQGKJjPT04?t=1560** (starts at 26:00 till 52:16) ---&gt; **Link to the talk**\n\nI recommend and even insist on a watch while trying to to understand and verify claims or otherwise refuting them which is very important due to the covert information war that has been declared, on not just us but the world.'<br />Author: 'grunge969'  id: 'dw5biq'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dw5biq/my_critique_of_the_video_understanding_kashmir/</li>

I live in J&amp;K\nBut I have experienced something common since the last 5 times I've gone up to a petrol station to get fuel in my bike or car.\n\nA common scenario - Everytime, there'll be 2 employees at a single booth. One who operates the machine and the other one who handles the cash. Each time, one would start off by asking me how much. \n\nTake for example what happened today, i said 500.\nApparently he hears 400 and in the meanwhile the other guy on the opposite side of the bike asked me cash or card. \nJust to draw my attention away.\n\nThe guy entered something on the keypad, showing me he entered 500\nBut i knew something's always up and had a look at the metre - it was 100. \nThe previous person had filled up 100 in his scooty.\nI said cash and the guy starts asking me about my bike's average. \nI take a peek at the meter and the guy starts filling petrol starting from 100.\nMeanwhile the other guy kept on chattering, i politely declined every question he asked. \nFinally when the metre hit 500 the guy pulled his nozzle out and asked for the money.\nI parked the bike, got off the bike and asked him how much he filled. He replied 500. And i could see he was nervous.\n\nThis was the 4th occasion i had been through this kind of a scenario. \nI called the manager and a small group of people formed up in the commotion. \n\nLong story short - the manager kept his silence and offered to wave the entire charge of petrol free but never accepted that his junior employee made a delibrate attempt at fraud. He maintained it was an isolated incident and an innocent mistake.\n\nThis is the situation at one of my town's most prominent petrol pump.\nThey've been caught on camera earlier as well. There's a whole video on Youtube.\nI paid my 400.\nFrustrated by my sleep deprived schedule.\nAnd left.\n\nI just reached home.\nI thought of posting this because the last time it happened i forgot.\nI feel i should remind everyone that please keep your eyes on the meter. \nMake no payment or conversation till your desired fuel is filled.\nRefuse to hear any special schemes they offer till your transaction is done.\nInsist on 0 meter value and if possible pre-fed values only. \n\nEven if They do this to 100 people per day for 100rs each, they are defrauding the public.\nIf possible, report them to police. \nI didn't. I accept its my fault if i don't. \nBeware friends\n\nEach time"<br />Author: 'deathwishpoet'  id: 'dvqud3'<br />Score:404<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dvqud3/a_reminder_to_all_indians/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Why I think the Shiv Sena has fucked up by forming the government in Maharashtra'<br />Body: 'Here I will enumerate point-by-point why I think S is making a grave mistake by forming the government with support of NCP and INC.\n\n#A bit of history\n\nMaharashtra is a special case where there\'s another strong RW party which can challenge the BJP in its Hindutvawadi agenda. There are few states in India with strong regional parties which have similar agenda to the BJP: TN with ADMK (although this is based only on what I have heard from Tamil friends and redditors), Punjab with Akali Dal (championing the Sikh nationalist agenda, coupled with Hindu/Dharmic nationalism), and Bihar with JDU (having the same development agenda as Modi). Maharashtra is also unique in the sense that the Sena has always been much more vocal about its Nationalist ideals than the state BJP, which allowed it to be the major partner in the alliance in the state. This, however, also allowed them to talk down to the BJP, and as long as Balasaheb was alive, the BJP really couldn\'t do much.\n\n2014 GE was the first election after the death of Balasaheb. The results were quite shocking even for the biggest bhakts, but even more so for the NDA coalition partners. If the BJP can form the government at the centre on its own (something even Vajpayeeji couldn\'t do), then what was to suggest they couldn\'t slowly do the same in the states too? On the other hand, state BJP units were jubilant hoping they could finally throw off the cumbersome chains of alliances and go their own way. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Maharashtra and Bihar, where the murmurs of discontent started almost the eve of the election results.\n\nThis is why we saw state elections in these two states with all alliances forgotten. While in Bihar BJP was crushed, in Maharashtra they were able to become the biggest party. The first time Sena was humbled on its turf.\n\n#Taking stock\n\nThe municipality elections after the state elections *again* showed that the Sena was not the mouthpiece of the Hindu RW in Maharashtra anymore. They won nothing other than the BMC, and that too barely. So the Sena had to swallow its pride and try to criticize the BJP from within the alliance. They did this quite effectively (at least as far as voter perception goes), well enough to ensure that the BJP could not ignore it in either the GE or the SAE. Most users here would have noticed that criticism of the BJP **from the Hindutvawadi right** has been steadily increasing throughout the first term, and I\'m sure the BJP noticed it too. Devendra Fadnavis has been in the news for all wrong reasons from a RW perspective. \n\n#The aftermath\n\nWell, now the Sena was in a good enough position to bargain for plum positions in the government, but not in as good a position as it thinks. True, the BJP could not form government on its own, but I think we should look at the Karnataka election results for a lesson. BJP did the whole drama of forming government and then losing the trust vote solely for purpose of perception. This created a sympathetic perception towards BSY and washed away his formerly corrupt image in the state. And eventually BJP has come into power again. Had Sena been watching, they would\'ve realised that the change in perception would help BJP much more than one more term for Fadnavis. Imo, they should\'ve gone to the negotiation table asking for the CM post, but given it away in favour of a Dty CMship or the Home Ministry. Better still, give this to Aditya Thackeray. It is pretty much known he\'s going to function as the puppet of Uddhav Thackeray, since that\'s how the Sena has always functioned. This would\'ve given Uddhav an insider very high up in the Mantralay, and basically zero accountability. They could have projected Aditya as "a youthful visionary" and taken credit for any good he does, whereas the blame would\'ve gone on the Fadnavis government. That would also give Sena the opportunity to steal tons (another thing Sena does well).\n\nInstead, they have decided to take all the blame and no credit by aligning with Sharad Pawar. Now even if the CM will be from the Sena, the puppet masters will be the NCP. But the worst thing this has done is turn the perception of the Sena from "the voice of the Marathi right" to "opportunistic power grabbers". Let\'s be honest nobody really knows or CAN know what formula the BJP-SS had agreed before the election. The point isn\'t what formula was agreed, the point isn\'t whether the BJP fulfilled its promise or not. The point is that the Sena seems to be fighting more for the CM post rather than for what the people voted. The BJP gets to sit back and watch the show as this government (inevitably) crumbles. \n\n#How can the Sena turn this around\n\nNow that the government will be formed, the Sena can still turn this around and change its public perception. For this, look to the Maharashtra\'s "eternal enemy", Bihar. Nitish Kumar formed a government with Lalu but Nitish ain\'t no fool. He used Lalu to get into power then but dumped him the minute he realised the BJP would still back him. He got the be the martyr by refusing to continue being Lalu\'s puppet but got to stay in power as well. The BJP got time to lick its wounds and rebuild.\n\nCan the Sena do something similar? Maybe. Two questions need to be answered:\n\n1. Is Sharad Pawar as desperate as Lalu to remain politically relevant?\n2. Is the Maharashtra BJP as weak as they\'re perceived in Bihar?\n\nOnly if the answers to both these are yes, can the Sena pull a Nitish Kumar. The worst thing Sena can do now is take this government to term. Their image would be irreparably damaged; they would in essence sacrifice themselves to rebuild the NCP. If the BJP refuses to prop up the Sena govt, that means fresh elections where Sena will be decimated. \n\nSena played the short con when they should\'ve played the long one. This helps the BIP and the NCP, and once-and-for all might rid Maharashtra of the Sena. Personally, I\'d like that a lot.'<br />Author: 'AandKhujau'  id: 'duqpgl'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/duqpgl/why_i_think_the_shiv_sena_has_fucked_up_by/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Never forget, the Centre and State Maharashtra BJP govts conspired with the builder lobby to desecrate a 11th century Shiva temple by allowing a "Kabristan" to be built near the ancient temple.'<br />Body: 'Ambarnath Temple in Maharashtra is one of the ancient temples of Bharat and is known for its unique architecture. It was built in 11th century AD and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This magnificent temple is located on the banks of Waldhuni river.\n\nAccording to legend, this temple was carved from a single stone by Pandavas in one night as they took shelter here. The temple has its Garbhagriha below the ground, reached by around 20 steps from the Mandapa.\xa0 The temple has open Shikhara, and legend has it that the temple has hidden passageway which was used by Pandavas. Interestingly you will find a passage that is now locked and nobody is allowed to go through. Every year lakhs of Hindus visit the temple especially during the holy Shravan month and Sivratri festivals.\n\nUnfortunately the ancient temple and the Deity has become victim to the appeasement politics of Bharatiya Janata Party. **A coterie of politicians from NDA government at centre, BJP government ruling Maharashtra state and Corporators of Bharatiya Janata Party ruling Ulhasnagar have come together to desecrate the sanctity of the temple by allowing a Muslim graveyard in the vicinity of the temple**. Hindus of the area were in a rude shock when they saw the proponents of Hindutva politics started treading the same old path of Muslim appeasement for a few votes. **The hardest part was that they chose to appease Muslims by desecrating the ancient temple and also by displacing hundreds of Hindu families living near the temple.**\n\nMuslims of the area were demanding a new graveyard for them in addition to the one they already use. They were issued a land which was far away from the temple at first. **However the land allocated for Muslim graveyard were opposed by builder mafia as they feared this will lower the value their property being developed**. ***Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hell bent on providing safe haven for businessmen, the BJP government in Maharashtra was no lesser in their friendliness with realtors***. The original land allotted for Muslim graveyard was changed and a new land near Ambarnath Siva temple was finalised by the administration.\n\n**Also the Muslim graveyard also included Ganesh Visarjan pond that was used by Hindus during Ganeshotsav.**\n\n**The intervention of the Narendra Modi government at centre also quickened the whole process. In year 2017, it is said that Muslims of the region requested Narendra Modi to intervene and he entrusted the matter to Muqtar Abbas Naqvi, the Minority Affairs minister. Naqvi inturn wrote a letter to Maharashtra government asking them to act on the request for graveyard for Muslims.**\n\nThe process of making a graveyard near Ambarnath temple was hastened after central intervention. **The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation which is governed by Bharatiya Janata Party issued notification of converting the land into graveyard.** This was done by ignoring the recommendation of many officers who cited the illegality of the same. The land was coming in the flood zone and was prohibited for use as graveyard.\n\nHindus were alarmed at the betrayal of the Hindutva politicians and had no other option except to move High Court. **However the remedy was denied as the Maharashtra government on oath misled the court with blatant lies in their affidavit. The court was made to believe that the graveyard was as per law and the Hindus who moved court was driven by malice.**\n\nSource - https://reclaimtemples.com/ambarnath-siva-temple-in-maharashtra-and-attemts-to-desecrate-it/\n\nPS - the cherry on top of the icing.\n\nLesson on Secularism by Bombay High Court – It’s Okay to have a Kabrastan Near Ancient Shiva Temple\n\nhttps://www.hindupost.in/lesson-on-secularism-by-bombay-high-court-its-okay-to-have-a-kabrastan-near-ancient-shiva-temple/'<br />Author: 'panditji_reloaded'  id: 'duozoe'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/duozoe/never_forget_the_centre_and_state_maharashtra_bjp/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Varna system =/= Jati system'<br />Body: "I saw some people mixing the two, saying Gita promotes Jativaad. Gita mentions the Varna system.\n\nHere's one way to understand the Varna system (on the physical level, not getting into other levels). If you have a team A consisting of Phelps, Bolt and Nemov. And team B consisting of their clones, same training per sport.\n\nIn team A, Phelps (short legs) does sprinting, Bolt (too tall) gymnastics, and Nemov (too short) does swimming. In team B, they were professionally assessed and do what they are good at (Phelps -&gt; swimming, Bolt -&gt; sprinting, Nemov -&gt; gymnastics).\n\nWhen you compare who will be more successful in a team A vs team B competition, ***both*** on an individual level and team level, it's obvious team B is far and away the better one. Both as individual and as a team.\n\nThe Varna system is a system based not just on on competencies (stemming from gunas), but vocation as well. If the two are aligned, it's obvious you'll be more likely to be successful. When individuals are better off, the country is as well (statistical technicalities like interaction notwithstanding).\n\nWhereas the Jati system does not consider competencies, and has resulted in incompetent people in charge, influence of genetics notwithstanding. And you're not forced to take up a vocation, as that might produce resentment against the vocation (same as arranged marriage - no forcing otherwise there might be resentment). Can't blame the idea if people today don't understand it. Although, if you choose something you're not good at, you're just sabotaging yourself because the world doesn't care about your feelings or your passion, only competence and results.\n\nExample: If you're not very bright, you're going to make a mediocre mathematician no matter how passionate you might be. So consider saving that spot for someone more suited and doing what you can be truly good at.\n\nSo I am all for preserving Brahmin Varna and eliminating Brahmin Jati.

      <li>Title::: 'TIL that on 6 December 2007 exactly 16 years after the destruction of the Babri Masjid – members of the upper-caste Muslim community in north Bihar’s East Champaran District demolished a Mosque that belonged to lower caste Muslims'<br />Body: 'https://m.himalmag.com/a-tale-of-two-mosques/\n\n&gt;This had not been a lone incident in Rampur-Bairiya. In one previous incident, during the marriage of the daughter of a lower-caste Muslim family, the bridegroom made the grievous mistake of arriving at the wedding in a Maruti car, a clear symbol of status in the backward village economy. In so doing, he drove through a street along which lived upper-caste Muslims. Pandemonium subsequently broke out as henchmen of the upper-caste community members attacked the wedding guests, and mixed mud into the food. To top it off, it was not the perpetrators that were later harassed by the police, but rather the victims themselves. It turned out that the local inspector was an upper-caste Muslim himself.\n\n&gt;A subsequent interview with the alleged architect of the Rampur-Bairiya mosque episode is telling. When the reporter asked his name, he replied “Mohammad Idrees”. But he was immediately interrupted by one of his female relatives standing nearby. “Why don’t you add Syed before your name?” she asked. Interestingly, later in the article, this same woman, when speaking of members of the Ansari community, kept addressing them with the derogatory term julaha (ignorant). During the subsequent conversation, Syed Idrees said: “We belong to the Syed Biradari [caste], which is just like the Brahmins of the Muslim community. Where does the question of our equality with them arise?’'<br />Author: 'Profit_kejru'  id: 'duawzi'<br />Score:289<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/duawzi/til_that_on_6_december_2007_exactly_16_years/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Was the demolition of Babri Masjid illegal?'<br />Body: 'Yes. It was illegal. It was also *right*. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n\nFacts: \n\n* Babri Masjid was built over a Temple\n* The site was at one of the holiest sites to Hindus, meaning the temple was likely the Ram temple.\n* The Masjid was a symbol of centuries of brutal oppression by Mughals.\n* The first records of legal claims against the structure were filed TWO CENTURIES AGO, in the 1820\'s, to the Colonial courts (under the British Raj), which repeatedly refused to look into the matter.\n* There were several subsequent attempts at legal recourse, over *decades*, by the Hindus. \n* Illegal demolition was NOT their first option.\n* The ASI has repeatedly conducted excavations (since the 70\'s) with religiously-mixed groups of archeologists, and eminent historians, and the conclusion has always been the same: There is a massive temple that was demolished to build the Masjid.\n* Their findings were always *intentionally suppressed* by the politically-powerful Left.\n* Legal avenues were intentionally stalled, pressurized, mired in controversy, and misled by propaganda and distortions, despite clear evidence presented by the plaintiffs.\n* The public debate was further poisoned by selective disinformation, and the factual findings of the ASI continued to remain heavily suppressed. \n* The media sowed further seeds of the communal divide, becoming a willing participant in the disinformation campaign.\n\nNone of these facts are even remotely disputed by anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty. There is enough documentation and evidence to back up each fact multiple times over, from various angles and sources.\n\nNow here is my opinion, based on these facts:\n\nIf you deny a person or community any recourse to justice, and **sabotage every sincere effort of theirs to amicably (and legally) resolve a situation**, you leave them no other choices, aside from either submitting to your whim, or choosing a path of vigilantism.\n\nThe Hindu community in India is a docile behemoth. They played nice, tried doing things by the book, had a legitimate claim, and were willing to make concessions towards an amicable solution. All they got in return was to be spurned, have lies and propaganda about them printed, have their legitimate claims mocked and ridiculed, have every reasonable effort stonewalled, and to top it all off, while they were treated like dirt, the propagandists, the anti-Hindu communal bandwagon, [misinformation-peddlers pretending to be historians](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/7hwp77/isnt_it_time_for_left_historians_to_apologise_to/dqudxf6/), were all paraded as heroes, as intellectuals, as being secular, as being honest, and as reliable sources.\n\nThe silent behemoth got fed up of playing fair with people who cared nothing for playing nice, and decided to get justice the dirty way. And that cursed building was reduced to rubble in hours.\n\nWhy care about what is legal or not, when the people opposing you have no such concerns and have no qualms about derailing legal proceedings, denying you access to a legal verdict, and abusing that advantage to suppress you?\n\nThere\'s a myth being spread around that "they could have just shifted the Masjid" as some people claim "Just like Tipu\'s armory".\n\nLeaving aside all the theoretical stuff about how feasible such an option was, given that it was not a free-standing structure, but had an entire *building* buried beneath it, let\'s look at the *practical* side of it.\n\n* Such an option may certainly have been explored, had the rabid propagandists actually acknowledged the factual claims of the Hindus.\n* Such an option might have been considered, had these people not seen fit to stall the process of *justice*.\n* Such an option might have been executed, if there had been some amicable agreement they were willing to reach.\n\nBut no. They decided to demonize Hindus instead. Now, tell me, how exactly might Hindus have gone about the rather time-consuming and complex task of moving the building (or getting the resources and permissions needed for such a task), when their opponents had no interest in even hearing them out. Do you imagine the Muslims would have taken any unilateral attempt by Hindus to *move* their structure with good grace? The same Hindus that were being demonized in the media?\n\nNo.\n\nThe Hindus had no option but to simply tear down this edifice of oppression, regardless of what names people called them, and how the \'secular forces\' and \'intellectuals\' ranted and raved against them.\n\nThis \'illegal act\' is squarely on the heads of every person, party, and organization, that conspired and colluded to deny Hindus their justice for the nearly 200 years that the Hindus sought a legal solution to the problem.\n\nThe same ones that never miss an opportunity to bring up justice for historical oppression of lower castes by upper castes, want **all castes** of Hindus to simply forget about the historical oppression of Hindus by Islamist tyrants.\n\nTearing down *every last brick* of that structure was **absolutely** the right thing to do, seeing how every other option was sealed shut.\n\nToday, we finally have a verdict, and while the courts have every right to chastise those that tore down the structure for breaking the law, the fact remains that without such action, the process would never have reached this stage. The verdict correctly allocates the possession of the land back to the Hindus, who have waited nearly 2 full centuries for such a verdict, and have lived for near 500 years under the shadow of the monument honoring those that terrorized them.\n\nJustice delayed is justice denied. Overall, this is a victory for truth, but the people who destroyed the illegal structure were *right* to commit their *illegal* act.'<br />Author: 'fsm_vs_cthulhu'  id: 'dtv5av'<br />Score:101<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dtv5av/was_the_demolition_of_babri_masjid_illegal/</li>

No doubt there should be some import but at this point when I go to any store most products say made in china or made in Vietnam. How do you expect economy to grow I'd Indian firms can't make any money and people working in those firms. Instead of blaming everything on the government maybe the consumers should wake up and buy a bit more locally made products and goods. Or else not even Congress, BJP or anyother party will be able to solve this problem. Our strength as country lies in us being self dependant and not dependent on another country. Jai Hind!!...

      <li>Title::: 'Government throwing money to help stalled projects is not a good idea'<br />Body: 'Reasons:\n\nThe reason why in India and especially places like Mumbai Municipal Region and NCR there are lakhs of unsold apartments, is because land prices and retail prices are totally out of touch with the buying capacity of the public. India real estate was fuelled by the wealthy class and NRIs for the last 10 years and just pushed land prices so high that it has ultimately shut out the middle class. \n\nThis needs to go through an automatic correction. Helping developers, half of which are struggling because black money dried up and the rest do not want/or  their projects will not meet RERA guidlines need to die. If that means unfinished, let it be. If and when the market turns the good guys will step in and these distressed assets will be bought out...but not with public money.\n\nGov argues that many homeowners are caught out with stalled projects, but then this is ridiculous that instead of cancelling their EMIs more money is being spent on developers! Homeowners instead should be given a choice to opt for finished but not sold apartments (of which there is a lakh or more).  \n\n\nGov says that eventually this fund will be sold to Sovereign wealth funds, the issue is this again seems to be signal that a bailout is given, and on top of that be made attractive enough for foreign money fuelling the price rise!'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'dsvl93'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dsvl93/government_throwing_money_to_help_stalled/</li>

After some internal discussion, we introduced certain systematic and fundamental changes to our Discord that we believe will have a manifold increase in the user engagement there as well.\n\nSome of the changes include:\n\n* **Archived redundant channels** thereby achieving a minimalist and uncluttered approach to minimize overwhelm  upon joining the server.\n* Added **country-specific self-assignable roles** as a pre-requisite before accessing the full server.\n* Updated **Discord specific IndiaSpeaks rules**. You\'ll be required to accept them before accessing the server.\n* Added **Meta channels** such as "Ask Mods". We **encourage users to tag Discord or Reddit mods** in such channels to interact with us directly and **provide feedback and suggestions** about the Discord and the subreddit in real-time.\n* **Announcement channel** will now be used by the mod team to **broadcast anything of prime** related to the sub as well as Discord. So do keep an eye on that one as well.\n* **Activity-specific self-assignable reactionary roles** will be added later. Tap on emojis to assign yourself roles on categorizes such as religion, games, political inclination, etc. Some of these roles are ping-able, as an example, you could ping all the users having a Call Of Duty role.\n\nThis is yet again a small step in line with our effort to build a better online community for Indians on Discord as well.\n\nSee you there!\n\n    The True Indian Discord for India: For Indians, By Indians\n\nInvite Link: [https://discord.gg/V8sCPac](https://discord.gg/V8sCPac)'<br />Author: 'chummekiraat'  id: 'dsv10z'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dsv10z/indiaspeaks_reworked_discord/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Two religions are fundamentally propaganda'<br />Body: "Inspired by the post: https://reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dssfop\n\n&gt; Two religions are fundamentally propaganda. Their core is false. So they survive by indoctrination. \n\nIt has worked for thousand years. and will continue to work for another thousand.\n\nWhat has changed? what boosted its spread?\n\nMoney. Cash inflow. The spread of any kingdom/religion is invariably accompanied by donations and cash infusion by rulers of states.\n\nWhy is hinduism not spreading like those two?\n\nSee answer above. Hinduism have been strangled to death by lack of cash- to spread and teach the religion in a proper way. Look at popular media now where growing up children/teenagers see nothing but mocking and contempt, made fun of. Add to that the influx of opportunistic babas giving bad name to the religion.\n\nWhat can YOU do about it?\n\nTeach the younger children in your household that hinduism is not what is displayed in television or other media. Teach them to think first, learn and respect religion later. The government can also release its stranglehold on temple funds and do something better about it.\n\n&gt; This is why weekly gathering is mandatory, to keep the flock controlled.\n\nThis works for all religions. Nothing wrong about it, but hindus have forgotten to learn, re-learn, and re define their religion and identities to modern times. Change is constant and persistant all over. What makes it different is constant re definition, adaption, with emphasis on teaching it to growing children/teenagers.\n\nWhere did you see last your child being taught religion in a positive manner?\n\nOn television you see third grade serials with mediocre characters with flying animals and magic. I am not against it, but the way its shown is making a mockery out of it.\n\nOn a fundamental level, all masses need to guided (controlled word do not endorse)\n\nAre YOU guiding the young ones in your family?\n\n&gt; But we must learn to counter propagandists who’ve done this for hundreds of years.\n\nThe question is not of counter anymore. It is of survival. India remains the only hindu (that also hindu majority, not solely hindu) nation in the world.\n\nFace the stark reality, hinduism is either constant/not-growing or will be in decline in future.\n\n&gt; https://reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dssfop/two_religions_are_fundamentally_propaganda_their/f6reufl/\n&gt; You can never 'win' against those two religions unless their psychology and human psychology is understood. The maxim for them is end justifies the means, either through violence or deception.\n\nThere is an element of darwinism at play here. in the short run, it has had created havoc, however in the long run those two have survived, expanded and grown beyond borders.\n\nAnd it will continue to grow in future also. Large amounts of state capital is being poured to spread those religion.\n\nWhere do we stand against this type of competition?\n\nNowhere. The only hindu nation in the world is busy trying to appear secular, appeal to masses. Forget about cash infusion to spread the religion. We cant even let lift the governments stranglehold on temple funds. All that money goes to government coffers, not for spreading hinduism.\n\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nThis is for the political party to implement, based on people's wish. Are you pushing your vote to the right cause?\n\n\nI support the modern preachers such as sadhguru, who have single handedly influenced large amount of people all around the world and he even goes to college campuses to talk. His talk appears modern and sensible so far.\n\nAll debates are welcome.\n\nTLDR: Spend some time reading it."<br />Author: 'CholiMein'  id: 'dsuhcq'<br />Score:18<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dsuhcq/two_religions_are_fundamentally_propaganda/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'A short-story I wrote based on the Kashmiri Pandits Exodus...'<br />Body: 'She was running, running in the same streets where once she used to frolic around with her friends. Her breathing was getting more erratic with each step she took. The murky night was devoid of of moonlight, while the broken streetlights meant that the entire alleyway was shrouded in darkness. The chilly winds of the esteemed Kashmiri Winter were making her skin frosty, as if forming flakes. Yet she couldn\'t stop, for the 5 men behind her won\'t. Her ears were buzzing due to the ice-cold weather, the only audible things to her were just 3 words - *Tchaliv, Raliv, ya Galiv,* which were emanating from the loudspeaker of a nearby mosque. Even in such a predicament, she could identify the source, as those 3 words were in the same slightly-distorted tune as the Morning *Azaan*, which used to be her "wakeup alarm" during her school-days. But now, that same tune was haunting her, brooding her, chasing her.\n\n\nHer legs started getting cramps, due to the seemingly eternal marathon that she was running for the last few hours. And her constant prayers to several of the Gods &amp; Goddesses that she believed in were answered - in the form of a dead-end. The wall was taller for even the tallest man to climb over, and when she turned to escape to a different lane, it was too late. The 5 men, one of them brandishing a shiny Kalashnikov while the others had torches, were huffing and seemed tired, but their faces soon lit up once they saw the wall - they had finally cornered her.\n\n\nWhen she woke up, she was lying on a familiar wooly carpet. Her hands, tied. Her legs, tied. Her mouth, muffled up. In front of her were 4 of those 5 chasers, playing a game of cards. They were laughing, eating and were having a great time beside the small fireplace. One of them soon noticed that she had woken up, and went out to call his 5th aide. The five then surrounded her, slapped her, verbally abused her, her family, her religion, her dignity. Her tears seemed invisible to them, as if they were children playing with a doll.\n\n\nUpon morning, they left. While her hands were freed, her legs were still tied up, her mouth was still muffled up, the only change was that she was feeling colder than ever. The fireplace was not burning, and the lack of clothes over her enabled the morning chill to take over her body. She was trembling. "Is it the cold? Or is it the fear?", she began asking herself questions to avoid being unconscious. She tried to move, but the pain in her broken legs was just too much. Although she was feeling painful, numb and sleepy because of the dreadful night, she waited for help. "Hope" is something she had always cherished, so she was holding on to the possibility of being rescued.\n\n\nWhen the forces arrived on that abandoned house, she was lying on that same carpet. Her legs were still tied up, her mouth was still muffled up, the campfire was still not burning, her body was still naked. The only change was - she wasn\'t feeling cold, neither was she crying. In fact, her pale face had an expression of satisfaction, as she laid there with a picture in her hands, a picture of her with her family which she somehow managed to get from the shelf beside the carpet. A *jawan* bent down to check her pulse.\n\n"Dead", was his response to his fellow soldiers.'<br />Author: 'sbnprd'  id: 'dsqx7d'<br />Score:191<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dsqx7d/a_shortstory_i_wrote_based_on_the_kashmiri/</li>

There is no penalty for acts of omission, although acts of commission are often questioned with a significant number of officers under the scanner for corruption and malfeasance. The once steel frame of Indian governance architecture has rotted with each service operating within its own silo and ready to go to war within the government to protect its own haloed turf.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Modi government’s decision to hold a common foundation course for all Group A services including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from 2020-2021 is the first step in breaking these silos and elite clubs that function within the Indian bureaucracy. That the twice-born IAS will have to rub shoulders with lesser mortals at the foundation stage and work towards a common purpose may change the game after all.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;By holding the 94th Foundation Course for 744 candidates to be appointed in IAS and other Group A services from August 26 to December 6, 2019, the government has made the right beginning with a six-day module at the feet of the Sardar Patel statue at Kevadia village in Gujarat. It was at this module that PM Modi exhorted trainee bureaucrats to double their outcomes so that India becomes a $5 trillion economy by 2022.'<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'dse1hr'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dse1hr/apne_mere_paanch_saal_barbad_kiye_hai_main_apko/</li>

The customer is a fairly wealthy businessman, with zero nose for tech, so they milked him for all his worth by converting him into a reseller, and getting a lakh in downpayment from him. When it came to the fact that he had to invest in hardware, and actually pay an IT guy to maintain his setup, they ended up pawning his customization requirements to the tech team.\n\nWhen the requirements arrived at my desk, I evaluated the customer as a partner and immediately rejected him requesting the management to initiate a refund. However, they didn\'t want to give up on an account that easily and pushed us to "enable" the customer. \n\nThe resulting email exchange telling the customer about how to setup their email address, walking through the dashboard, followed by the customer\'s frustrated mails when he wasn\'t able to follow these simple instructions all of it was about a month long process. There were multiple phone calls my team made on his behalf to domain providers etc. to help him get the ball rolling. None of it was fruitful in the end, and we gave up on the customer.\n\nThe management then processed something like 70% of his refund, which legitimately pissed him off further.  \nHe made a blog on his website, and ran it on google adwords with the title "\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ IS A FRAUD" .   \n\n\nIt\'s been a few years, and there has been legit traffic to the post thanks to google\'s algorithm. Now whenever a displeased customer googles complaints about the company, the post shows up. On the post he posted all the name and phone numbers of people he interacted with, including me. So I now show up on searches for this post when people search my name.\n\nIs my first recourse, reaching out to him and asking him to take it down?

India's economy is in the emergency room, with a sharp slowdown in growth threatening to turn into a collapse. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring the root causes behind the recent sharp slowdown in economic growth focusing on the longstanding government interference in the financial system for short term political gains, the sharp consumption shocks through demonetization and the implementation of the GST, and the series of financial scandals that have severely dented confidence in India's financial system.\n\nTo continue with the analogy to a person suffering a heart attack, one can think of the Indian governments habit of intervening in financial markets as lifelong diet of junk food and cigarettes. While populist intervention in the government economy might not have directly caused the current financial crisis, understanding this populism is essential context to the current crisis.

This has raised concerns that India will be flooded with cheaper imported goods, particularly from China and dairy products from Australia and New Zealand.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; One of the key issues concerns the base year. India is opposed to the proposal that 2013 be treated as the base year for reducing tariffs, effectively implying that member countries should slash import duties on products to the level that existed in 2013. India is pushing for 2019 as the base year, given that import duties on many products such as textiles and the electronic products have gone up in the last six years.   \n&gt;  \n&gt; India want an auto-trigger mechanism to be institutionalised in the pact. This would serve as a kind of protective mechanism that a member country can invoke to safeguard in case of a unexpected flow of imports after RCEP comes into effect.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Besides, there are issues around ratchet obligations. India wants exemptions built into the ratchet obligations as part of the pact. A ratchet obligations implies that a member country cannot raising tariffs once the pact comes into effect. An exemption would imply that a country will be able to erect restrictive measures later on grounds of protecting national interest.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is also the issue of data localisation under RCEP deal. India wants all countries to have the rights to protect data. This would imply that countries can share data only where it is “necessary to achieve a legitimate public policy objective” or “necessary in the country's opinion, for the protection of its essential security interests or national interests”."<br />Author: 'eff50'  id: 'drj0da'<br />Score:5<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/drj0da/rcep_key_issues_that_pushed_india_to_say_no_read/</li>

He was joined surprisingly by the crown prince of the opposition PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who made a speech against the "selected PM". Among the allegations against Khan is that he has ruined the economy and collaborated with Indian PM Modi to "destroy" Kashmir.

Johnson hopes to use this election to get enough MPs to push through his Brexit deal, which has been postponed yet again to January 31. The House of Commons endorsed his move in a 438-20 vote. While polls give Johnson\'s Tories an edge, the Labour Party led by notorious anti-Semite and India-hater Jeremy Corbyn has seen their numbers steadily go up. Previous UK PM Theresa May also called a general election, where she ended up going into a minority.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: The Armenian Genocide\n\nThe word \'genocide\' is thrown around routinely by Very Smart People ™ today, but real genocides get much less attention. While the Holocaust against the Jews of Europe during World War II is well-known, the genocide that actually led to the coining of the term has been left obscure in our history. This is the sad story of the Armenian genocide, the worst event of World War I. \n\nThe Armenians are an ethnic group in the Middle East that were some of the earliest converts to Christianity. In 1555, their lands in Europe as well as Anatolia (which forms most of modern Turkey) were conquered by the Ottoman Empire, where they became a large minority of about 3 million people. While the Ottoman Empire officially granted self-administration to religious minorities, the reality was quite different in the countryside. The official policy of the Muslim empire towards religious minorities (mainly Christians and Jews) was that of the *dhimmi*: in theory they could practice their own religion, but they had several restrictions placed on them. Minorities could not build new places of worship, they could not worship in public, they could not testify in criminal cases against a Muslim, they could not carry weapons, and they could not travel on horses or camels, the most convenient forms of travel in those days. They were often over-taxed and arbitrarily jailed by the Turkish and Kurdish elite. Essentially, under the *dhimmi* system, religious minorities could exist as long as there was no evidence that they did.\n\nThe Armenians were a resilient bunch, well-organized around their church. They protested vehemently and at every opportunity, constantly asking European powers such as Britain and France to intervene at the plight of Christians in the Ottoman Empire. In 1856, when those powers threatened to invade, Sultan Abdul Hamid II declared Turkey a constitutional monarchy, establishing a Parliament that sought to enact religious freedoms. Once the heat was off however, he dissolved the Parliament, and nothing changed for the Armenians. Britain and France, too involved in Russia\'s great game in the Caucasus, did little but offer words. \n\nIn 1890, the Sultan came upon an idea. He decided to label the reports of the plight of Armenians as exaggerated, because, he claimed, Armenians were a very small minority (they were not, in reality). He created facts on the ground by establishing militia, largely made up of loyal Kurds, to "deal with" Armenians who spoke up. This led to the Hamidian massacres that saw thousands of Armenians killed in violence all over the Empire. Then, in 1912, the First Balkan War broke out and ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, virtually pushing out Turkish influence from the Balkans. Muslims living there were also expelled and sent to Anatolia in what was left of the Empire. Two years later, in 1914, World War I broke out, where Turkey joined the Central Powers. \n\nInitially, the Turkish authorities tried to co-opt the Armenians to fight with them, but mounting losses led to them declaring *jihad* against the Christians in the Empire, who they deemed traitors. In 1915, Directive 8682 was passed, ordering all Armenians in the Turkish military to be demobilized and used as forced labour instead. A forced conscription policy was adopted to pull all able-bodied Armenian men into forced labour, where most would ultimately die. In April, 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople were deported to Ankara, where they were ultimately killed. With that began the genocide: Turkish authorities ordered all Armenians (including women and children) to be deported to the deserts of the province of Syria in death marches, where most of them died of hunger and exhaustion. The property of deportees was forcefully seized, ostensibly to be given to the Muslim refugees from the Balkans. The few that did survive the death marches were housed in concentration camps, where virtually all of them died and were buried in mass graves. Other genocidal methods included mass burning of villages, drowning, and deadly human experiments by physicians. \n\nAfter the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World War I, the Allies ordered a court martial of Turkish leaders for the genocide, where they were found guilty (many in absentia). However, most of the guilty were freed in an exchange of prisoners in 1920 and 1921 and faced few consequences for their actions.

      <li>Title::: 'Should India join RCEP'<br />Body: 'Some arguments why India shouldn\'t join RCEP :\n\n1. Past FTAs have not really worked for India. For example, in trade with ASEAN, Japan, China,  our imports rose significantly faster than our exports. This is mainly because our manufacturing is noncompetitive, thus leading to us exporting raw goods/less value added products and importing more value-added products. (Why manufacturing is noncompetitive is mainly due to much higher real interest rate(and thus higher cost of capital) as compared to competitors, bad labor laws, land acquisition is also an issue)\n2. FTA\'s have left services(mainly software services) out of their purview, where India has the real advantage.\n\nSome arguments why India should join RCEP\n\n1. One easy way to make our exports grow is to import cheap parts from other countries, assemble here(and thus add value) and export the final product. This is how China did in the initial stages of its developement. Also. this is what has been done in our country in mobile phone manufacturing with wonderful results. This will mean lowering import barriers, and thus entering into FTAs. But for this to work to our advantage we have to make manufacturing competitive in our country(which includes labor reforms, lowering the real interest rates)\n2. (controlled)Competition in general good and leads to overall efficiency.\n3. Moving people from agriculture to low level manufacturing is our only hope. If you think of it every issue in the country has its root in low efficiency of agriculture in our country.\n\nSo in my understanding the **govt. should enter into RCEP only if**:\n\n1. Services are properly covered in the agreement.\n2. Before the phased reduction in tariffs kicks in, introduce labor reforms, land reforms, reduce cost of capital. This can be done as we have Modi in center with an unprecedented mandate. Modi govt. took some risks in its first term, and through them giving 303 seats to BJP, the voters have said to govt. "TAKE RISKS, TAKE INDIA AHEAD".\n\nMy predictions:\n\n1. Govt. has negotiated VERY hard in RCEP discussions, and India WILL sign the deal.\n2. But this will lead to govt. persuading the Monetary Advisory committee to sharply cut the rates in December.\n3. Labor reforms will be introduced in Parliament in the winter session.\n4. One reason(apart from intuition) I say this because the High level advisory group, setup by the commerce ministry has come up with a bold and radical report, one suggestion of which to reduce the corporate tax was recently adopted by the govt.( [https://swarajyamag.com/economy/advisory-group-to-commerce-and-industry-ministry-has-some-bold-suggestions-but-then-india-didnt-give-modi-303-to-be-timid?fbclid=IwAR3yH4XatKp0qvybx19zIlD-8x9oO4aerW6spF4L8bHdgP18Q8\\_pH4\\_6mH8](https://swarajyamag.com/economy/advisory-group-to-commerce-and-industry-ministry-has-some-bold-suggestions-but-then-india-didnt-give-modi-303-to-be-timid?fbclid=IwAR3yH4XatKp0qvybx19zIlD-8x9oO4aerW6spF4L8bHdgP18Q8_pH4_6mH8) )'<br />Author: 'alchemist119'  id: 'dqji63'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dqji63/should_india_join_rcep/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[OC] Why Congress can never claim the legacy of Sardar Patel'<br />Body: "Some facts which might surprise many about [Sardar Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel).\n\nHas anyone heard about the name Meppally Keshava Krishnankutty Nair, who was commonly known as M. K. K. Nayar.\n\nM. K. K. Nayar was a bureaucrat of top level during the post-independence India. He was the force behind the rise of Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) into one of Kerala’s first successful industrial units in the sixties and seventies.\n\nFor a years M. K. K. Nayar was hounded on false cases of corruption against him by the Congress party. It was done by the CBI on the behest of then central government. This case continued for years and years (more than a decade) and he was acquitted by the appeals court just some time before he was passed.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Nehru had found out, that M. K. K. Nayar, as a bureaucrat, in his personal dairy, had used derogatory remarks against Nehru. Nehru and his legacy wanted and took revenge against him.\n\nIndia lost the services of a great bureaucrat only and only because of vile hatred by one man and his legacy.\n\nBut is it the only thing he wrote. Not really. Years ago, he wrote an autobiography, called *Aarodum Paribhavamillathe* in Malyalam, which was originally published in 1995 and its English translation, *Story of an Era Told Without Ill-will* or *With Malice Towards None: The Chronicle of an Era*, was published later. In that book, he had written about various functioning and inner workings of the government and bureaucracy.\n\nSo how is he related to our main topic, the iron man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel?\n\nAfter passing IAS and becoming a bureaucrat, M. K. K. Nayar came in contact and became close with V.P. Menon another great civil servant of the country, who was post-independence the secretary of the Ministry of the States, headed by none other than, guess whom, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\n\nIt was through V.P. Menon that M. K. K. Nayar came to know about various political things, many of which M. K. K. Nayar might have experienced first hand or through V.P. Menon and has written in his autobiography.\n\nOut of many things he has written in his autobiography, the most moving is about Nehru and Sardar Patel relations.\n\nIn 1948, a cabinet meeting discussing the worsening situation in Hyderabad due to government of India calling back the army, Sardar Patel was angry and he demanded the army should be sent back to Hyderabad to liberate it from the Nizam and his military called Razakars. This is when Nehru got really angry and told Sardar Patel:\n\n&gt;You are a total communalist and I shall not accept your advice.\n\nSardar Patel, a person who joined India and made  it into one, a communalist?\n\nPatel, saddened by these words, it is said he immediately walked out of the meeting and in his life never attended a single cabinet meeting Nehru was part of. These parts about Sardar leaving the meeting and not attending again, however, are unconfirmed.\n\nWhat is confirmed however, is that as we know it, as Sardar wanted and something Nehru was not happy about, army was finally sent to Hyderabad and then the Nizam had to sign the agreement to integrate with the dominion of India.\n\nBut if that insult of Sardar Patel was not enough, Nehru did his best to insult and settle scores with Sardar Patel, even after he passed.\n\nM. K. K. Nayar writes. After the passing of Sardar Patel, Nehru, in his official capacity, immediately ordered the Home Ministry to immediately return the Cadillac car used by Patel. A great leader had passed and the thing Nehru cared for was wanting the return of a Cadillac car that Patel used in his official capacity as an Home Minister.\n\nBut that insult too was still not enough. Nehru wanted to take it to the next level. Nehru released a second memo where he specifically instructed all the officials who wanted to participate in the funeral of the great Sardar Patel, to do so in their own. Now whether Nehru tried to intimidate the officers to not attend the funeral of the great Sardar Patel or did he say that, do it in your personal capacity and not official capacity as the GOI has nothing to do with the biggest unifier and home minister of India, it's not for sure.\n\nIt's also well known how Sardar Patel was going to become the first PM of India, as backed by all the states of that time but Nehru convinced Gandhi to force Sardar Patel to take back his candidature for the same.\n\nThis is just couple of many examples of what Congress did with the likes of Sardar Patel and anyone who dared to question the Nehru and the Gandhi family.\n\nWhat's for sure is that the Congress didn't respect nor treated either both Sardar Patel and M. K. K. Nayar, in a good manner, or rather far from it.\n\nSardar Patel belongs to India and not to the Congress.\n\nThat is why, Congress can *never* claim the legacy of the great Sardar Patel.\n\nSources for the information:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._K._K._Nair\n\nhttps://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/230517/powerful-leader-hounded-mkk-nayar-babu-paul.html\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34727987-arodum-paribhavamillathe\n\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21046255-the-story-of-an-era-told-without-ill-will\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._P._Menon\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/autobiography-of-an-administrator-also-a-political-chronicle/article17681824.ece\n\nhttps://wap.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/nehru-called-patel-a-total-communalist-113110500934_1.html\n\nhttps://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/011118/hyderabad-owes-patel-for-its-freedom.html ."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'dqgz6m'<br />Score:55<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dqgz6m/oc_why_congress_can_never_claim_the_legacy_of/</li>

Seems legit af. When was the sangh against dalits? Why do I feel that Modi has no control over the deep state actors doing shit like this. Is it an inside hitjob to malign modi\'s image by lutyns gang?\n\n\n"Shalini Gera, Bastar-based lawyer for jailed activist Sudha Bhardwaj and co-founder of Jagdalpur Legal Aid Group: “I was getting repeated video calls from a Swedish number which would disappear.” She became aware of her phone being targeted when Citizen Lab told her a fortnight ago about Pegasus being used by an operator. She was told that between February and May 2019, her phone was listened into, and possibly mirrored. WhatsApp contacted her and sent her a message on October 29, advising her to take precautions.\n\nAnand Teltumbde, civil and Dalit rights activist and scholar. Professor at the Goa Institute of Management. Was arrested for alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case and subsequently released: “The same person, the senior researcher at the University of Toronto, who contacted everyone else, contacted me. This was about ten days ago. I am a bit cautious now, I don’t respond. A message came that he wanted to talk to me. I have a friend in the university in Toronto. I called and he confirmed the identity of the person… Message from WhatsApp confirming this came on the 29th or the 30th. What is left to be said.”\n\nBela Somari/Bhatia, Bastar-based human rights lawyer and activist: “This was in late September. Citizen Lab contacted me… They said WhatsApp had contacted them and they do this kind of protection work for civilians. WhatsApp had given them a list of people… They said they work on this technology and right now they seem to have curbed it… nevertheless you need to be alert and change your phone… A couple of times, there were these calls that I did not take… On October 29, WhatsApp sent a message informing me of what had happened.”\n\nNihal Singh Rathod, Nagpur-based lawyer who is also junior to lawyer-activist Surendra Gadling, arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case: “I was getting missed video calls via WhatsApp continuously. I changed my phone in January 2019. I raised a complaint with WhatsApp on March 28. The missed video calls soon stopped. I got a call from Citizen Lab on October 7 and then on October 14. Their researcher told me about specific threats from someone using Pegasus to do surveillance. They disclosed this specifically to me on October 14.”\n\nJagdish Meshram, Gadchiroli-based lawyer, member of the Indian Association of People’s Lawyers: “I received several international video calls between March and May this year. Sometimes one in two-four days and sometimes twice a day. I must have received 20-odd such calls during the period. Whenever I tried to take the call, it would get disconnected. Today, I came to know about the Israeli spyware Pegasus.”\n\nAnkit Grewal, Chandigarh-based human rights lawyer and Joint Secretary, Indian Association of People’s Lawyers: “It began after March 2019 and continued till May. At least, 8 missed calls (video) were received from foreign numbers. I have been closely associated with Sudha Bharadwaj in different capacities. I was the petitioner who filed a habeas corpus before the Punjab and Haryana High Court when she was arrested.”\n\nVivek Sundara, Mumbai-based civil and environmental rights activist: “I probably had a couple of missed calls from numbers that seemed very strange. The institute in Toronto had been sending me WhatsApp messages, warning me about these things… I just deleted everything, thinking what can be all this. I spoke to some friends, and it has turned out to be true.”\n\nDegree Prasad Chouhan, Chhattisgarh-based tribal, Dalit and human rights activist. From the Chhattisgarh chapter of PUCL: “I first saw some unusual activity in my email account after I got an email… I got suspicious and did not open it. The institute in Canada reached out to me a day later which I also initially ignored. But then someone from the institute sent me a video message which I heard and then spoke to the person… On October 29, I got a message from WhatsApp stating what had taken place and the steps I should take.”\n\nSeema Azad, human rights activist, associated with PUCL, brings out a Hindi magazine from Allahabad, Dastak Naye Samay Ki: “WhatsApp did message me… advised me to update the app. But I was busy and thought it was a routine message, so I disregarded it.”\n\nDr Saroj Giri, Lecturer in Political Science, Delhi University: “Citizen Lab contacted me a month-and-half ago. I had no idea who they were, but when I researched, I realised it was serious. WhatsApp contacted me much later, and I was told they would send me a report on suspicious activities on my phone a week later, and they did send it to me. Then I got a specific WhatsApp message on October 29.”\n\nAmar Singh Chahal, Chandigarh-based human rights lawyer and member of Lawyers for Human Rights International: “I am not aware of this.”\n\nRajeev Sharma, Delhi-based columnist and strategic affairs analyst: “I got a WhatsApp message at 9.36 pm on October 29, saying my phone may have been at risk. The first call I got was from the Canada-based NGO 15-20 days ago… I was advised to change my phone.”\n\nShubhranshu Chaudhary, formerly with BBC World Service, now does ‘peace journalism’ in Chhattisgarh, used to run CG Net/Swara and now ‘Bultu’ Radio (or Bluetooth radio) amongst Adivasis: “A few months ago, I got a call asking me ‘Who are you’, so I asked, ‘Who are you?’ They asked if I had seen some strange activities on my phone, I recalled I had, of material disappearing sometimes. I was then told I was on a ‘list’. They asked me if I would cooperate while they repaired the flaw. I agreed and have been in touch since, and going through digital security protocols and learning how to be more secure.”\n\nSantosh Bharatiya, Delhi-based journalist, Editor-in-Chief of online news portal Chauthi Duniya, former Janata Dal MP: “I did get texts from Citizen Lab and WhatsApp but I did not make much of it till I looked again just now. They had alerted me to a ‘specific cyber risk that we believe that you faced earlier this year’.”\n\nAshish Gupta, Delhi-based journalist who heads the Asomiya Pratidin bureau, also a civil rights activist with Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisation: “I am a journalist and a human rights activist. I got a call from Canada’s Citizen Lab in early October… I was told about WhatsApp and advised some basic precautions. On July 5, a very odd thing happened. I found myself removed from all WhatsApp groups without my taking any action.”\n\nSidhant Sibal, Delhi-based journalist. Principal Diplomatic and Defence Correspondent with WION: “I knew about the breach one month ago when WhatsApp via Citizen Lab contacted me and told me about the snooping and my phone having been targeted.” "'<br />Author: 'MaiMeeseek'  id: 'dq0fxo'<br />Score:1<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dq0fxo/ask_why_is_our_govt_using_jewtech_to_snoop_on/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'An example of The Wire fabricating evidence on Saraswati river'<br />Body: 'So now there is undeniable evidence of a river flowing where the Saraswati is said to have been. Summarized in a comment if you are interested.\n\nI\'m going off the two papers listed in the comment. The Wire\'s article: https://thewire.in/the-sciences/the-saraswati-is-a-river-that-never-was-and-flowed-always-in-the-peoples-hearts/amp/\n\n&gt;How did such a mighty river disappear without leaving any topographical signatures?\n\nLies. ISRO imagery shows these signs.\n\n&gt; The Drishawati is now a minor stream known as the Ghaggar-Hakra.\n\nLies. This is a different river system. One of the papers they cite explains it.\n\n&gt;This proposition has been critiqued by scholars like Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib and Rajesh Kochar: the RV’s description of the river does not match with the Ghaggar, which is seasonally active.\n\nAssumes the current state of the river is how it has always flowed. When research shows that to not be the case.\n\n&gt;Instead, they suggested that the name ‘Saraswati’ could have been derived from ‘Haraxvati’, a major river located in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nCompletely ignores the names of cities situated along these rivers, which are of course found in India.\n\n&gt;The change in perspective began with a 2012 paper by Liviu Giosan and others. They suggested that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial network was not the product of a large glacier-fed Himalayan river but of a rain-fed stream originating from the lower hills.\n\nThe is only the case later on. Earlier it was indeed a fed from Himalayas. This is no longer "suggested", it was proved in the study you linked.\n\n&gt;In 2016, Ajit Singh et al agreed that the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel was a former course of the Sutlej, which diverted to its present course 17,000 years ago.\n\nAjit Singh later in Nov 2017 published the study you linked to. And it says 8000 years ago. The Wire chose to ignore this.\n\n&gt;Then, in 2018, Aditi Krishna Dave and others suggested that glacially driven rivers stopped flowing in that part of the interfluve region sometime between 24,000 and 45,000 years ago – again, much before the Harappans settled in that area.\n\nLies. The [study](https://docdro.id/UmwI3Z6) (behind paywall, so I uploaded to a sharing site. [Original link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101417302029) ) actually concludes:\n\n&gt;"The Sutlej traversed the present day Ghaggar valley until \\~8-10 ka, before adopting its present course..."\n\nwhich is line with our two papers.

      <li>Title::: "Modi's history is filled with hate, power grabs, bigotry, ignorance, lies and borderline genocide. If you care for this country, read the linked article. Many Indians love Modi because he gives voice to their inner bigot. The man is the beneficiary of a PR campaign and a corrupt, inept judiciary."<br />Body: "Here's the link:\n\nhttp://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile\n\nIt's very long but here are the portions that stuck out to me:\nHis role in the 2002 riots\n\nThat same night, Ehsan Jafri, a 72-year-old former MP for Ahmedabad, called his granddaughter Anika in Surat with some disappointing news. Ensconced in his home in Gulburg Society, a mostly Muslim upper-middle class neighbourhood in Ahmedabad, Jafri, a veteran Congress politician, already sensed it would be risky to attempt a journey to Surat the next day. On the phone, he told Anika he wouldn’t be able to come. “But it’s just a shutdown, and he should make it,” she protested to her mother.\n\nAt around noon on 28 February, Anika called her grandfather again. “Have you not started?” she asked him. “Beta, the situation is not good here,” Jafri answered. “There are mobs everywhere.” He told her he needed to put the phone down, since he had a lot of calls to make.\n\nA huge mob had already gathered around Gulburg Society, armed with petrol bombs, cycle chains and swords, shouting slogans like “Take revenge and slaughter the Muslims.” Many of Jafri’s neighbours, as well as Muslims from neighbouring slums, had come to his house seeking safety, expecting that his status as a former member of Parliament would afford them protection. “He must have made over a hundred phone calls for help,” Jafri’s wife, Zakia, told me. He called the Gujarat director-general of police, the Ahmedabad police commissioner, the state chief secretary and dozens of others, pleading for their intercession. A witness who survived the carnage later told a court that Jafri even called Narendra Modi: “When I asked him what Modi said, [Jafri] said there was no question of help, instead he got abuses.” Word of Jafri’s frantic calls for help even reached Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani in Delhi: a BJP insider close to Modi, who was with Advani on 28 February, told me that the BJP leader had even called Modi’s office himself to ask about Jafri.\n\nBy 2:30 pm, the mobs had broken through the gates of the housing society, and a flood of men converged on Jafri’s home. Women were raped and then burned alive; men were made to shout “Jai Shri Ram”, and then cut to pieces; children were not spared. According to records later submitted in court, Jafri was stripped and paraded naked before the attackers cut off his fingers and legs and dragged his body into a burning pyre. The official police report indicates that 59 people were murdered in Gulburg Society, though independent inquiries put the number at 69 or 70. Jafri’s wife, Zakia, and a few others who had locked themselves in an upstairs room survived.\n\nTo this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.\n\n“His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”\n\n“Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.\n\n“I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”\nHis interactions with businessmen\n\nModi was joined on stage by the heads of two venerable business families, Jamshyd Godrej and Rahul Bajaj, as well as the director-general of the CII, Tarun Das. If Modi expected a friendly welcome from Godrej and Bajaj, he did not get it. After recounting an incident from the previous month in Mumbai, when an Oxford University professor had heckled Modi at a public event meant to celebrate his election, Godrej called on Modi to use the mandate from his victory to ensure the safety and security of all Gujaratis.\n\nBajaj was even more outspoken: he began by declaring that 2002 had been a “lost year” for Gujarat. Looking at Modi, he asked, “Why don’t we get investment in Kashmir, the Northeast, or Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? It is not just the lack of infrastructure, but also the sense of insecurity. I hope this won’t happen in Gujarat—all this comes to mind because of the unfortunate events last year.”\n\nBajaj turned once again to Modi: “We would like to know what you believe in, what you stand for, because leadership is important,” he said. “You are today the undisputed leader of your party and government in Gujarat and we want to know you better …We are prepared to work with governments of all hues, but we also have our own views on what is good for our society and what works for it.”\n\nModi listened patiently to the torrent of criticism, silent but furious.\n\n“You and your pseudo-secular friends,” Modi roared at the leaders of Indian industry, “can come to Gujarat if you want an answer. Talk to my people. Gujarat is the most peaceful state in the country.” Tension filled the room. Modi continued, turning to Godrej and Bajaj: “Others have vested interest in maligning Gujarat. What is your interest?”\n\nModi carried his fury back to Gujarat, and quickly set about showing the CII who really had the upper hand. Within a few days, a group of Gujarati businessmen close to Modi—including Gautam Adani of Adani Group, Indravadan Modi of Cadila Pharmaceuticals, Karsan Patel of Nirma Group, and Anil Bakeri of Bakeri Engineers—had established a rival organisation, which they called the Resurgent Group of Gujarat (RGG), all of whose members threatened to withdraw from the CII on the grounds that it had humiliated and insulted Modi and all Gujaratis. The RGG issued a press statement swearing by the pride of Gujaratis, and demanded that the Gujarat chapter of the CII resign for “failing to protect the interests of the state”.\n\nFaced with an open revolt from a crucial state and its powerful business community, Tarun Das had good reason to worry: more than 100 companies from Gujarat were threatening to leave the CII, which would cripple the organisation’s presence in Western India; back in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government began to limit the CII’s access to its ministers, jeopardising the group’s core mission as a lobbying organisation.\n\nDas reached out to the BJP leader Arun Jaitley, then the Union law minister and a close friend of Modi, seeking to make amends. Over a two-hour conversation at his house, Jaitley quizzed Das on the CII and its intentions, and then told Das that he would raise the issue with Modi, who was expected to come home for dinner one day soon.\n\nA few days later, Jaitley told Das that the issue could be resolved: Modi wanted a formal apology from the CII. Das was eager to oblige, though not without some hesitation, as he later recounted in a long post-retirement interview with Business Today:\n\n“The evening I was leaving to meet Modi [to deliver the letter of apology], my wife accosted me, ‘You just can’t do this….’ Among our close friends are Anu Aga, Azim Premji, Jamshyd Godrej and several from the Parsi and Muslim communities. My answer was that I had two options: I could quit and say I will not do this. Else, I had to look after our members.”\nHis Days at the RSS\n\nThe pracharak related an incident that took place during the Emergency: “We in the ABVP were told to organise agitations against the government, from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, and one day we were holding a meeting at the Bhullabhai Char Rasta in Ahmedabad,” he said. “We were supposed to speak against the government, but in a sober tone, because that was the Sangh style, and also the police and the intelligence agencies were watching over us. But while the meeting was on, Narendrabhai passed by on a cycle. He was furious at the composed serenity in our protest. He jumped onto the stage, grabbed the mike and began giving a rabble-rousing speech, spitting abusive words, and not hiding his anger against the government.”\n\n“The audience loved it. But that night, at Hedgewar Bhavan, the senior Sangh leaders scolded Modi for his detrimental and unwarranted act—for a nearly-underground Sangh pracharak to come out in the open. ‘Forget about speaking,’ they lectured him, ‘you shouldn’t have even gone there. Even if the meeting failed, it would be okay, but discipline and obedience to one’s role is superior to all.’”\n\nFor all his allegiance to the Sangh and its ideology, the organisation’s structure and style—placing the group above the individual, restraining one’s anger, respecting the protocols established by the leadership—did not mesh with Modi’s personality.\n\nShankarsinh Vaghela, who was senior to Modi in the RSS and the BJP, and later became chief minister of Gujarat and one of Modi’s bitter rivals, recalled that even as a young man Narendra chafed at the strictures of the Sangh. “Modi used to miss the morning shakha quite often by sleeping late,” Vaghela said. “He always used to do things differently from others in the group—if all of us wore long-sleeved kurtas, he used to wear short sleeves, and when all of us wore khaki shorts, he wore white shorts. And I remember one day the visiting RSS leader Golwalkar questioning Modi in public for keeping a trimmed beard.”\nHis economic record in Gujarat\n\nIn the wake of the 2002 riots, Modi skillfully painted any criticism of his government’s misdeeds as an attack on Gujarat and Gujaratis. Over the past few years, and with considerably more subtlety, he has achieved the same thing with the story of the state’s development miracle. The government has relentlessly provided the media with positive stories of efficient administration, rapid construction and economic growth.\n\nModi likes to flaunt the fact that Gujarat is a power-excess state, and almost every big-picture story about the “Gujarat miracle”, from Business Today to The Sydney Morning Herald, highlights this fact. But farmers, led by the Sangh’s own farmers’ union, have been protesting for almost a decade that their electricity needs aren’t being met, and government statistics show that the share of power diverted to agriculture has fallen from 43 percent to 21 percent between 2000 and 2010. More than 375,000 farmers are still waiting for electricity connections for their irrigation pumps.\n\nEven the headline figures for Gujarat’s economic expansion in the past decade diminish under closer examination. The state’s GDP growth has only slightly outpaced India as a whole over the past decade. But this is to be expected: Gujarat has long been an industrialised state—and in fact, growth rates under Modi are not significantly higher than they were in the prior two decades. Though Modi has presented Gujarat as the clear leader among Indian states in attracting foreign direct investment, it ranked fourth among states on this measure between 2000 and 2009, and in 2011 fell to sixth place, after Maharashtra, the National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh; Maharashtra has foreign direct investment inflows almost nine times greater than Gujarat.\n\nData from the Planning Commission, meanwhile, show that in spite of Gujarat’s economic growth, the state lags behind even Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in rates of poverty reduction. According to the 2011 India Human Development Report, Gujarat also scores poorly in several social indicators, with 44 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, worse than Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBy themselves, these statistics hardly constitute an indictment of Modi’s record. They merely suggest that his carefully constructed image as an economic miracle-worker has been the result of a well-managed public relations campaign whose false premise is that Gujarat stands head and shoulders above every other Indian state in growth and development—and that anyone who presents data to challenge this narrative is only twisting the truth in order to malign Modi and every Gujarati.\nHow he deals with opponents inside his party\n\nAT THE TIME OF THE 2002 RIOTS, Gordhan Zadaphia was Gujarat’s minister of state for home affairs—junior to Modi, who also held the home portfolio—and like Modi, he stands accused of complicity in the violence. A VHP leader in Gujarat for 15 years, Zadaphia joined the BJP in the early 1990s. “The RSS told me to work in the BJP, and I became a general secretary for the party in Gujarat,” Zadaphia explained.\n\nHe is also one of three prominent leaders in the Gujarat BJP—all of them with impeccable Sangh credentials—who spoke out against Modi’s autocratic style within the party. The first, Haren Pandya, who had served as Modi’s revenue minister, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 2003. The second, Sanjay Joshi, who had become a general secretary in the national BJP, was forced to resign when a CD containing pictures of him with naked women—later determined to be fake—was anonymously circulated to top BJP leaders. And Zadaphia, the third, was pushed out of the cabinet by the end of 2002, and subsequently ejected from the party.\n\n“Modi understands only one alphabet, and that is capital I,” Zadaphia told me. “I was threatened with death by Modi himself.”\n\n“It was in February 2005,” Zadaphia continued. “I noticed an intelligence man from the state police following me, and when I confronted him, he told me he was instructed by the home minister’s office to shadow me.” A few days later, Zadaphia said, there was a meeting of BJP legislators with the chief minister. “I asked Modi in the meeting, ‘Narendrabhai, what kind of spy activities are you doing against your own party legislators?’ I asked, why is an intelligence man following me? Then Vajubhai Vala, a senior minister, took the microphone and said ‘Okay Gordhanbhai, cool down. We will look into it, but this is not a question to be asked now.’ Modi didn’t speak at all, but I got a note from his secretary that said ‘Please meet the CM.’”\n\n“I met him at his chamber after the meeting. [Deputy home minister] Amit Shah was sitting there. Modi asked me, ‘Why are you asking these kinds of questions in public?’ I said, ‘What shall I do? It is not a private matter.’ Then he looked sternly into my eyes and said, ‘Khatam ho jaoge Govardhanbhai…’—You’re going to get finished.’”\n\n“I asked him, what kind of finishing? Physically or politically?”\n\n“He said, ‘You complained against me to LK Advani and Om Mathur in Delhi.’”\n\n“I said, of course. There’s no option for me other than to complain to the people in Delhi. But if you’re saying you will finish me off, let me tell you, I’ll die when my time comes. Don’t try to threaten me again.”\n\nZadaphia moves around with a police escort and a dozen armed security men; as a former deputy home minister—and a controversial one at that—he was offered protection by the government after the riots. Pandya, however, did not have security guards. “Haren was bold,” Zadaphia said. “He thought nothing would happen to him. That was a mistake.”\n\nA tall and handsome Brahmin with a fine RSS pedigree and excellent connections in the media, Pandya was a formidable political rival for Modi within the state BJP. The two clashed publicly for the first time in 2001, when Modi was in search of a safe assembly seat to contest after his appointment as CM. He wanted to run from Pandya’s constituency, Ellisbridge in Ahmedabad—a very safe seat for the BJP. But Pandya refused to yield to Modi’s wishes. As a state BJP functionary recalled, “Haren said, ‘Ask me to vacate my seat for a young man in the BJP—I’ll do it. But not for that fellow.’”\n\nIn May 2002, three months after the start of the riots, Pandya secretly gave a deposition to an independent fact-finding panel led by Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Modi could not have known what Pandya said, but written records show that Modi’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, instructed the director-general of state intelligence to track Pandya’s movements, and in particular those related to the fact-finding panel. The intelligence director took down the instructions in a register—the entry for 7 June 2002 reads as follows: “Dr PK Mishra added that Shri Harenbhai Pandya, minister for revenue is suspected to be the minister involved in the matter. Thereafter, he gave one mobile number 9824030629 and asked for getting call details.”\n\nFive days later, on 12 June 2002, there is another entry in the register: “Informed Dr PK Mishra that the minister who is suspected to have met the private inquiry commission (Justice VR Krishna Iyer) is known to be Mr Haren Pandya. I also informed that the matter cannot be given in writing as this issue is quite sensitive and not connected with the charter of duties given to State intelligence Bureau vide Bombay Police Manual. It is learnt that the telephone number 9824030629 is the mobile phone of Shri Harenbhai Pandya.”\n\nNews reports soon revealed that an unnamed minister in Modi’s cabinet had deposed before the Iyer commission, and described for the first time the meeting at Modi’s residence on the night of the train burning, at which Modi allegedly told his top police and intelligence officers that there would be justice for Godhra the next day, and ordered the police not to stand in the way of the “Hindu backlash”.\n\nThe leak provided sufficient evidence for Modi to press a case of indiscipline against Pandya within the BJP, and two months later Pandya was forced to resign from the cabinet. But Modi was not finished. The state elections were due in December 2002, and Modi saw an opportunity to deny Pandya the Ellisbridge seat that he had refused to vacate a year earlier. “Modi never forgets, and never forgives,” the BJP insider close to the chief minister told me. “It doesn’t help a politician to have such longterm vengeance.”\n\nAnd so Modi denied Pandya the constituency he had represented for 15 years. The leadership of both the RSS and the BJP objected and asked Modi to relent, but he refused. Near the end of November, RSS leader Madan Das Devi went to meet Modi at his residence, carrying a message from the RSS supremo KS Sudarshan, his deputy Mohan Bhagawat, LK Advani and AB Vajpayee: Stop arguing, don’t create division before the elections, and give Pandya his seat. Devi stayed late into the night, but Modi held his ground, the state party functionary said: “He knew he would start getting phone calls from [RSS headquarters] Nagpur and Delhi, since he did not listen to Devi. So that night, by 3 am, he got himself admitted into the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital for exhaustion and fatigue.”\n\nPandya, according to the party functionary, charged to the hospital to confront Modi. “Haren told him, ‘Don’t sleep like a coward. Have the guts to say no to me.’” Modi refused to budge, and the RSS and BJP leaders finally gave in. Modi left the hospital after two days, and handed Pandya’s seat to a newcomer. And in December, he came back to power riding the post-Godhra wave of communal polarisation.\n\nPandya, for his part, started to meet with every top leader in the BJP and RSS—in Delhi and in Nagpur—telling them that Modi would destroy the party and the Sangh for his own personal gain. Senior BJP figures, who still regarded Pandya as a valuable asset to the party, decided to transfer him to headquarters in Delhi as a member of the national executive or a party spokesman. “Modi even tried to scuttle that,” Zadaphia told me. “Pandya going to Delhi was going to be harmful for Modi in the long run.”\n\nThree months later, in March 2003, on the day after Pandya received a fax from the party president ordering his shift to Delhi, he was murdered in Ahmedabad. The Gujarat police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced that Pandya had been assassinated in a joint operation between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Dubai-based underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Twelve men were arrested and charged with Pandya’s murder, but eight years later, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acquitted every single one and rubbished the entire case. “The investigation has all throughout been botched up and blinkered,” the judge said. “The investigating officers concerned ought to be held accountable for their ineptitude resulting into injustice, huge harassment of many persons concerned and enormous waste of public resources and public time of the courts.”\n\nPandya’s father, Vithalbhai, has publicly accused Modi of ordering his son’s killing, and moved a petition in the Supreme Court calling for the chief minister to be investigated, though the court dismissed it, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nRB Sreekumar, who headed the state intelligence for a year soon after the riot, told me that he had been asked by the chief minister’s office to regularly give details about the movements and activities of Haren Pandya.\n\n“I’m not saying Modi got Haren Pandya killed. I have no evidence. But the fact remains—anyone who speaks against Modi from inside the BJP gets finished either physically or politically,” Zadaphia told me."<br />Author: 'Urban_Aghori'  id: 'do7emk'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/do7emk/modis_history_is_filled_with_hate_power_grabs/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'TIL that one of the earliest references to Ramayana are found in Tamil Sangam literature'<br />Body: 'So this is not exactly a TIL. A few days ago, a guy in Voldemort was asking about historicity of Ramayana. I decided to follow one of the comments which mentioned that the Ramayana is referenced in the Sangam literature. \n\n\nApparently one of the earliest mentions to Ramayana &amp; it\'s contents are made in Tamil Sangam literature namely the *Purananuru* poem 378 (300BCE) where the poet refers to the gifts received by the king as Sita\'s jewels which Sugreev &amp; his monkeys got when she threw them down while struggling with Ravana.\n\nThen there is another one, namely, *Akananuru* poem 70 (b/w 400 &amp; 200BCE) which mentions a triumphant Rama sitting under a banyan tree at Dhanuskodi (Rameswaram).\n\nNow, here is where it gets interesting. The ""scientific wisdom"" has been that\n\na) The story of Ramayana was written about 500BCE (give or take a century or two)\n\nb) The story gradually spread from the modern day cow belt to rest of India (Tamil Ramayana in 11th century, telugu in 13th &amp; so forth)\n\nBut if the Tamil poets of the Sangam period are so casually referring to Rama then it means **that the story of Rama**was already known to the Tamils by this point &amp; was common enough that everybody would understand it ala how almost all of us could get a Sholay or Mother India reference. This not only pushes back the traditionally accepted date, it also punctures a hole into the narrative that Rama is an Aryan import to the Dravidian south &amp; all other nonsensical theories.\n\n\nHere are the links to the full text of both the poems\n\n[Purananuru](https://sangamtranslationsbyvaidehi.com/ettuthokai-purananuru-201-400/) this contains a translation of 200 poems from that text\n\n\n[Akananuru](https://www.adakshinamurthy.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/akananuru-neythal-poem-70/amp/)'<br />Author: 'Sikander-i-Sani'  id: 'do5k5d'<br />Score:71<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/do5k5d/til_that_one_of_the_earliest_references_to/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Some kid fell into a well in rural TN and rescue operations ongoing for 36+ hours. People are blaming Modi for the slow rescue!!!! WTF'<br />Body: 'A 2y old kid Surjith Wilson fell into a borewell on Friday evening in his father\'s farmhouse. This  100-ft borewell was dug by the family itself; it was abandoned later as there was no water beneath. The family had simply covered the top by some plastic sheet (unclear exactly what) which seems to have come off in the heavy rains the days before. So naturally, when the kid played, he fell into the borewell. Very unfortunate. However, note that, despite the Deepavali season, rescue forces were immediately engaged. First came the police, then the firemen, then NDRF, etc. Nobody was able to rescue the kid so far. Now ONGC is digging up a tunnel to try rescue him.\n\nRead the following links for more details:\n\n[https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/borewell-horror-4-robotic-devices-used-rescue-sujith-fail-yield-results-111266](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/borewell-horror-4-robotic-devices-used-rescue-sujith-fail-yield-results-111266)\n\n[https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-borewell-horror-sujiths-mother-puts-aside-fear-stitch-bag-rescue-son-111256](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-borewell-horror-sujiths-mother-puts-aside-fear-stitch-bag-rescue-son-111256)\n\nNow coming to the main part of my post - while this is going on, people are quick to start blaming **MODI** of all people!

      <li>Title::: 'The Bravery of Indian Armed Forces circa 1971'<br />Body: 'Sunday morning, 11 July 1971.\n\nA detachment of the First Maratha Regiment, 8 Mountain Division, Indian Army, march into the Lotha Naga country, in a place called Yankeli.  Yankeli is a small village, established in 1927. Comprising of approximately 35 houses, this village is situated atop a mountain. \n\nThey drive out the entire male population of the village and detain the women and children under heavy guard. Many women are assaulted and a **pregnant woman**, the wife of a pastor is hit with a stone on her abdomen, which leads to a premature delivery of a dead baby. \n\nThe Commanding Officer of the unit took fancy to four virgins among the women. The girls were then forcibly led to the local Baptist church, where the Army men raped them. The whole village was kept heavily guarded.\n\nThe four girls were : \n\n* Miss Shanchano Lotha, **age 17 years**, the first girl to be taken inside the church by the CO and his subordinate. The other three girls were left waiting at the entrance of the church under armed sentry. Her hands and legs were fastened to the legs of a chair. She was molested there. After this, she was taken to the pulpit of the church and raped by an officer; another army personnel — whom she could not name but who she believed to be an officer — covered her mouth in order to muffle her screaming. \n* Miss Nseno Lotha, **age 15 years**, was subject to treatment similar to the first girl and the CO raped her in the pulpit.\n* Miss Abeni, **age 12 years**, was raped in the pulpit of the church while other army personnel held her to prevent her from struggling. She recalled being taken out of the church as they began to abuse Thengtena, the youngest among the victims.\n* Miss Thengtena, **age 11 years**, was apparently mentally challenged from childhood. She was taken fallen ill shortly after the incident; she never recovered, and died some years later. \n\n[Source1](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0vekq6s2RyYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=rape+at+yankeli&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I7CynG7k7F&amp;sig=ACfU3U0YOzroYa8bOq0L-giEF55BR-atqg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg6tOS77rlAhULuY8KHQ0dC88Q6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rape%20at%20yankeli&amp;f=false)\n\n[Source2](http://wiscomp.org/Publications/13%20-%20Perspectives%205%20-%20The%20Armed%20Forces%20(Special%20Powers)%20Act%20and%20Its%20Impact%20on%20Women%20in%20Nagaland.pdf)\n\n[Source3](http://ncwapps.nic.in/pdfreports/The%20Impact%20of%20Armed%20Conflict%20on%20Women%20Case%20Studies%20from%20Nagaland%20&amp;%20Tripura.pdf)\n\nThe church has been abandoned  after the incident and now lies in ruins.'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'dnlj1m'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dnlj1m/the_bravery_of_indian_armed_forces_circa_1971/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Rethink about Privatisation'<br />Body: 'I have noticed that most of the people in this subreddit support privatization, mainly because of the common perception that PSUs are less competitive, their employees are lazy, and their service quality is poor. But one must not forget that  PSU like ONGC were profit making for a long time but now it is debt ridden because of the mismanagement under current govt. Also the perception that employees in this PSUs are lazy is not true, because if it was real many PSUs would already have been closed by now, but instead they were making profits. Yes some employees are lazy but their percentage is very low as compared to the total workforce and this problem can also be resolved by implementing strict regulations. Selling these companies to corporates and that even by unfair means(personal favor) will cause more harm than good. The profit of PSU is received by the government which can use it to fund other public welfare schemes but the profit of private entity just add up to owner wealth which in turn creates more income inequality. Crony capitalism will lead to monopoly and that is not good at all. Even strong developed economy like China follows State capitalism and as a result income inequality there is low. Also if you think that private companies perform well as compare to PSUs, so let me remind you that nepotism and favoritism is rampant inside these companies on top level. Instead of privatizing every PSU the govt. must focus more on improving their performance by implementing regulation. This will help in job creation and also will increase competition in market which will be beneficial for the public too. I can understand that many of you will disagree but i will still say that privatisation is not good.'<br />Author: 'nucleartoys'  id: 'dn0960'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dn0960/rethink_about_privatisation/</li>

Let\'s call him X.\n\n\nX is a middle-aged man (in his late 30s or early 40s) and is a regular at my *chacha\'s* grocery store and his business requires him to travel to Mumbai/Pune a lot. My home is in West Bengal. I have known him for a long time and he is a really nice person. His own house is just a few blocks away from my house, and so me and my *chacha* were invited to his home on Eid (I was at home due to college vacations).\n\n\nWe went, we ate a big feast there (no beef though) and since it was just us (we went a little late to the party), my *chacha* and X began discussing politics. I, too, joined in the conversation and what followed was something unprecedented and unexpected to me. X spoke about his involvement with Shiv Sena and RSS and how he has been a long time member in both these organizations. He has worked on-ground for several of RSS\'s charity activities and as for Shiv Sena he is part of the *prachaar* committee. He spoke about how it requires real work to climb up the ranks in these organizations, and how the inner workings of these organizations are strict AF. Yeah, you still need to boot-lick a bit, but hardwork trumps boot-licking by a small margin.\n\n\nHis words and views were really simple yet rational. He spoke how the Opposition and the anti-BJP brigade is trying to malign RSS\'s name, while completely ignoring several of the good deeds that RSS does. He laughed when I told him about how some idiots call RSS a terrorist organization, to which he said, "Yehi bewakoof phir EVM hacking-EVM hacking chillate hain." And he was not speaking like a *Bhakt*, he admitted that RSS &amp;amp; BJP have some miscreants within them who try to spark communal hatred (like BJP MLA Raja Singh) and condemned them, but he added that every party has these miscreants - Indian politics has always been dirty and it\'s something that needs to be dealt with across the parties instead of clobbering down on a single party. All three of us then discussed how the anti-Modi brigade has become blind in it\'s hatred towards BJP/RSS and is literally speaking the same words as Pakistan. The funny thing was, just after bringing up Pakistan we immediately started roasting BJP too for it\'s mishandling of the economy and how the next Lok Sabha session is going to be crucial from an economic standpoint.\n\n\nOverall, the discussion involved really simple views, but proved to be rather insightful for me as a Centrist (yeah yeah, roast me for this).\n\n\nP.S. : To anyone who thinks I am making all this up, think whatever you want.

The nepali driver stopped and refused to move towards nepal china border even though he was on nepali side. Apparently chinese not only regularly come on nepal side of border to detain people they also have infrastructure placed here like cameras to track people. Nepal knows this but can't do anything. This is mainly done to capture Tibetans who are running away from china, but also power projection by china.\n\nRecently chinese even proposed an agreement between nepal and china from which they would be able to take back Tibetan refugee back to china forcibly. Their PM would've agreed to it if not for internal resistance. But if there's anything we know about china they'll be back with more force.\n\nAnother interesting matter is that Sagarmatha aka mount everest is shared by nepal china both. It's not in nepal but nepali side is most commonly used one. Chinese have recently invested highly on their side and both countries have a long standing dispute on what should be the official height. \n\nNepal makes so much noise against india whenever it has any problems with us, and even accuse is of encroaching their side of border, but you don't you don't see them doing this for china. We don't hear much about it.

      <li>Title::: 'The queen bee and her friends'<br />Body: 'Story time.\n\nThis a story of the queen bee and her two friends. As the name insinuates, the queen bee loved all the attention and adoration she got from others. It made her feel special. However, her two friends were kind of recluse and timid. The two friends rarely talked to anyone which was even worse when it was just the two of them. The queen bee, being the only girl of the group, was special. Even the two friends loved her, although not the way the kingpin, a new player of the group, did. One might say, she was like a pampered sister to them. The kingpin on the other hand, desired more than just attention, he desired control over the group. He saw an opportunity in using the queen bee.\n\nThe best way to get the control would be to get the queen bee, the one everyone adored, on his side. So he faked interest in her and made her feel more special than the two friends. Now the friends treated her with special care as it was and this additional attention from the kingpin made her feel ecstatic. Eventually, as the kingpin planned, the queen bee would fall for him. The kingpin and the queen bee, unknown to their two friends, were a perfect match and never disagreed about anything. The queen bee liked doing things together and wanted the entire group to do it with her. Even though she projected confidence and conviction that would make a giraffe feel short, unbeknownst to the world, she was actually quite insecure. She was afraid of being disliked and her ideas being shot down. Now, being the social butterfly she was, she could not just leave others be. She had to somehow make all her friends join in her ventures every time. So she asked the kingpin for help, as she was under the impression that he would do anything for her. This worked perfectly for the kingpin who wanted to control the entire group. He could control the group and keep the support of the queen bee simultaneously. He decided to pretend as if he was doing those things for her while in reality he was doing it for himself. So they came up with a plan and oh what a marvelous plan it was. They decided to leverage the silence and timidness of their friends to manipulate them. \n\nOh, you would be surprised on how simple, yet effective the idea was. The plan, the kingpin and the queen bee came up with, was simply based on a trick - like a magic trick. All they had to do was make each of the friends believe that they had no other choice. And how does one convince others of anything in a social setting? Either you provide evidence to back your claim or you just tell them that everyone else thinks the same. The kingpin and the queen bee chose the latter. They couldn’t be bothered to go to extraordinary lengths to prove their ideas were fun; they were preoccupied in coming up with fun misadventures. So whenever questioned they would say everyone else agrees. \n\nNow, there was a key ingredient missing in this plan. They had to ensure that none of the two friends would question their decisions in the presence of the other. Otherwise, their lie would be caught by the two friends. This task was simple enough, given that the two friends were little reserved, but the kingpin and the queen would not risk anything on chance. So they decided to beat them down into submission. They would regularly invite one of the two friends, while ensuring the other friend got the wind of this social gathering, and the friend who was unfortunate to join them would be relentlessly harassed - sometimes physically, sometimes mentally. They mocked the friends, on different occasions, for their appearance, their beliefs and their intellectual prowess. This was plan was infallible. The self-esteem of the friends, being timid as they were, was destroyed. Each of them believed that they were the lowest rung in this social ladder and other 3 were superior in every manner. Ridden with grief and inferiority they were sure to stay silent and observe. Now, with the wheels set in motion, the kingpin and the queen bee were free to choose their outings without hindrance or opposition and make sure the friends joined them; Even if they both fancied it not. So eager, the friends were, to be accepted by the queen bee that they listen to everything she said. The kingpin was made the de facto leader of the group just because the queen bee, very gracefully and subtly, made the friends believe that he possessed something they did not. Only if they knew of the game the kingpin and the queen bee were playing; only if the queen bee knew of the game the kingpin was playing. Alas! That was not meant to be, due to the thorough plan executed meticulously by the kingpin. This status quo lasted for a long time, long enough for a man’s birth and death.\n\nLike all good things, nothing lasts forever. The triumph, the support, the adoration enjoyed by the kingpin, would inevitably come to an end. For there was a hurricane coming into his life. A fool, moved in as the neighbor to the kingpin. Now the fool, being the neighbor, could see the queen bee frequently visiting the kingpin and came to the conclusion that they must be together. Since the fool was new to the city and had no friends, he decided to join his neighbor’s social group. Now, the fool, was in no way timid. He was confident, a bit too confident based on his abilities, one might say. Maybe, that’s where the name came from. The kingpin was aware of his new neighbors intellectual inadequacies. He believed that the fool did not have the caliber to harm or even comprehend the web of lies that kept this social group together. So the kingpin decided to play along, hoping that the fool will eventually fall into his place. There was the mistake. One can not predict or rationalize a fool’s actions. They are vague, sometimes random and completely unpredictable. \n\nLike the hurricane, he shattered their world. The fool, being talkative as he was, would constantly strike up conversation with the friends, the queen bee and the kingpin without any hesitation . This was new to the two friends. So deep was their trauma, that they would not dare start talking unless addressed to. Yet here was a fool, who would just go up and talk their leader. And the fool, of course being new to the group, did not have any preference. He talked to everyone with the same level of intimacy. The fool would compliment everybody - sometimes a little lie or two - to break the ice. He wanted to be part of the group and naturally wanted everyone to like him. This was something different; so different from their experience with the kingpin and the queen bee. The friends, who were constantly mocked and had their confidence humbled, finally started to feel good about themselves. They started speaking to him more often because they liked him. Now, as true with any social event, people flock around the person everyone likes. And here was the fool at the center of attention of everyone, although the kingpin and the queen bee had a different motive to pay attention. They could see that their dominance over the social group was slipping away. Soon they were following ideas that the fool came up with, many a times reject the idea suggested by the queen bee or the kingpin. The two friends had realized that they both can have views opposing that of the queen bee. She was longer the center of attention or affection. They no longer had to tolerate the kingpin and the queen bee or the abuse they were subjected to. The group broke apart, figuratively. There were now some social gatherings where the kingpin and the queen bee were no longer welcome. Such was the tragedy. “All the effort that took to set up this intricate plan in motion was undone by just a fool”, the kingpin says. He could not take it. So he talked to the queen bee and decided to be even more intimidating and dominating. What has worked in the past surely must work in the future? Isn’t that the law of nature?\n\nThe queen bee, following the kingpin’s lead, would now openly mock the two friends. The kingpin and the queen bee tried to belittle them further calling them names, by ridiculing their habits and  deriding them as intellectually inferior. All this was done hoping those three inferior creatures would realize the truth; the truth that the friends and the fool belong under the feet of the queen bee and, as a consequence, under the feet of the kingpin. After all, the queen bee is special and she likes the kingpin. So it is natural that everyone else should worship the two of them. However, this only furthered the divide and loss of adoration that queen bee enjoyed in the past.\n\nWhat the kingpin and the queen bee failed to realize was ‘it is true the laws of nature don’t change but the laws of nature also permit evolution and adaptation’. The success which their plan saw in the past was heavily dependent on the isolation of the two friends. This was no longer possible and with the fool questioning their command at every turn, they could no longer bully the friends into submission.\n\nThe kingpin and the queen bee were now beaten and ignored. However, they would not just accept it gracefully. The kingpin thought, the fool played dirty and tried to make the queen bee take up stance against the fool. The idea was to make the friends choose between the queen bee and the fool. “The fool is being nice to you only because he hates me. You both are fools to believe him”, the queen bee says to the two friends. This was the kingpin manipulating the queen bee to remove the one thorn in his life which was preventing their group from going back to the way things were. The kingpin too chimed in support of the queen bee, naturally. However, this would no longer work because the adoration the friends had for her was lost when they found out about the carefully hidden intimate relation between the kingpin and the queen bee, again credit to the fool. The friends even talked to each other about the atrocities that were done to them in the other’s absence. The truth was bare for all to witness.\n\nIt only takes a spark to ignite a web of lies. In this story, the fool was that spark.\n\n Of course, the kingpin and the queen bee still remained with the group, one cannot just change cities because they lost social dominance. However, they have not given up yet. There will be children of the two friends who can be coerced or the fool may slip up and lose his leverage over the two friends. There is always an opportunity to be exploited and victims to be ensnared. What remains to be seen is, will the kingpin still keep the queen bee by his side as she no longer holds any control over the the group? Will the queen bee find out about the kingpin’s ulterior motives or has the pampering got to her head and turned her into a lost cause?\n\nFurthermore, It is not clear if one should be wary of the fool’s motivations or not. He is the leader of the group now and the change was rather drastic. It was the kingpin who introduced him to the group as the fool and no one really knows his true name or where he came from. Everything fell into place so magically that it seems too good to be true. Yet, worry not because now the two friends have found their lost self-esteem and their voice. It is up to them to ensure that this group never does something that isn’t good for all irrespective of who leads the group - the fool or the kingpin. It is up to them to enlighten the queen bee of the game kingpin was playing. \n\nAfter all, the real players that mattered were always the two friends and the queen bee.\n\nTHE END\n\nSequel coming out after 2024.

      <li>Title::: 'Fraud!'<br />Body: 'My father got an SMS stating, "You are invited for a dinner at Sayaji Indore by Legacy International. If you are accepting please give a missed call." We got excited and gave a missed call. They reached my father and booked a table for us. They told us to fill a form, which asked about family members and how many times you take a vacation. We were invited to a conference room where more families were present. One of the members of the staff greeted us and had a meeting with us. He explained that the company is a travel company which has tie-ups with different hotels and resorts and thus provides accommodation and travel plans to families. My father was cynical about everything and was constantly telling us that they might be a fraud. But they told everything with very professionalism. We believed them. They showed us a brochure of about 50-60 pages having different travel destinations. They described their 3 membership plans with benefits of them. We agreed on the basic plan which cost about 75000/- Rupees.\n\nThey told us that you can pay the amount from the bank on EMI. But, my father hadn\'t brought his card so he said we will pay tomorrow at your office. The manager started insisting and said that sir the EMI option is just for today. Then after some time, he sent an employee with us at our home for the payment. We tried several times but we were not able to complete the payment as my father was not able to remember the PIN. Then they said we can go to the nearby ATM and reset the PIN. They kept on insisting and then I took the employer to the ATM after multiple tries and calls to customer care we were not able to process the payment or to reset the PIN. Then the employer called his boss who asked the details and completed the payment. They also gave us some legal documents and other than their insisting nature everything looked like it was genuine.\n\nAfter some time we went to the address they provided. There was no office, then we tried their website, it didn\'t exist. The phone numbers of the employees were not connecting. We realised that they were a fraud and has conned us. We lost 75000/- rupees + the interest which will come on the EMI.\n\nNow, is there anything we can do to get them caught as we were not the only idiots there. They conned many people.\n\n\nSorry for the bad English.

      <li>Title::: 'Swami Vivekananda on Islam and importance of reason in religion'<br />Body: 'Now, some Mohammedans are the crudest in this respect, and the most sectarian. Their watch-word is: "There is one God, and Mohammed is His Prophet." Everything beyond that not only is bad, but must be destroyed forthwith, at a moment’s notice, every man or woman who does not exactly believe in that must be killed; everything that does not belong to this worship must be immediately broken; every book that teaches anything else must be burnt. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, for five hundred years blood ran all over the world. That is Mohammedanism. Nevertheless, among these Mohammedans, wherever there has a philosophic man, he was sure to protest against these cruelties. In that he showed the touch of the Divine and realised a fragment of the truth; he was not playing with his religion; for it was not his father\'s religion he was talking, but spoke the truth direct like a man.[70]\n\nThe more selfish a man, the more immoral he is. And so also with the race. That race which is bound down to itself has been the most cruel and the most wicked in the whole world. There has not been a religion that has clung to this dualism more than that founded by the Prophet of Arabia, and there has not been a religion, which has shed so much blood and been so cruel to other men. In the Koran there is the doctrine that a man who does not believe these teachings should be killed, it is a mercy to kill him! And the surest way to get to heaven, where there are beautiful houris and all sorts of sense enjoyments, is by killing these unbelievers. Think of the bloodshed there has been in consequence of such beliefs! [71]\n\nWhy religions should claim that they are not bound to abide by the standpoint of reason, no one knows. If one does not take the standard of reason, there cannot be any true judgment, even in the case of religions. One religion may ordain something very hideous. For instance, the Mohammedan religion allows Mohammedans to kill all who are not of their religion. It is clearly stated in the Koran, Kill the infidels if they do not become Mohammedans. They must be put to fire and sword. Now if we tell a Mohammedan that this is wrong, he will naturally ask, "How do you know that? How do you know it is not good? My book says it is."

Why did the Ministry seek this clarification and what is the thought process behind sending the notice?\n\nFirstly, we need to understand that this entire issue is not at all with respect to Rahul Gandhi's citizenship. Confused? The whole issue is in relation to the property owned by Rahul Gandhi in foreign countries.\n\nThe question of citizenship is only a cover.\n\nIf Rahul Gandhi replies to the Ministry that he was and still is an Indian citizen, the question arises who was the owner of the British property and money in British banks.\n\n2. Then Rahul Gandhi has to say that in order to do business in UK he had to fake a British citizenship but he is Indian citizen.\n\nThere are two issues which thus arise:\n\nThe first is how he purchased property in UK.\n\n1. The Indian law is very clear that any Indian citizen who wishes to purchase property abroad has to take permission from both the Home Ministry and External Affairs Ministry which Rahul Gandhi has not done.\n\n2. The other issue is why didn't he take permission when the UPA was in power in 2005. The reason is simple. When black money is used for buying property how can one report it and take permission.\n\n3. Due to this he will be forced to give a reply stating that he took a British citizenship. Once he accepts this his Indian citizenship automatically gets cancelled.\n\n4. Now let's come to the question that if he has property in UK why did he hide it from the Government. What was the reason behind this and what was the business he was doing in UK? Because his office is located 90 miles outside London in a remote village where no one resides.\n\n5. Assuming that he had purchased the office for running his business why is it closed since 2004. Where did the income come from for which he has paid income tax in UK and filed income tax return. This proves that this was laundering of black money.\n\n6.If Rahul Gandhi decides to forego his properties in UK and wants to continue being an MP in India he has to lie that he is not a British citizen. In such a scenario,the Government of India can seize his foreign properties since Rahul Gandhi's signature is there on the documents\n\n7. If he accepts that he is a British citizen, then his Indian citizenship will get cancelled. On top of this, his MP position would be stripped and he could go to jail for having fooled the country and the Parliament all these years.\n\n*8. Whatever Subramanian Swamy does, he does it with proper evidence and complete preparation. Though he is not a lawyer he has been successful in all his cases.* This case of Swamy has tightened the noose around Rahul Gandhi's neck.\n\n\nNow **Rahul Gandhi Khan** is literally caught between the devil and the deep sea!\n\n*This is a translation of a Hindi post by a news paper columnist Mr. Sushil Kumar Saroagi Jindal, New Delhi*"<br />Author: 'panditji_reloaded'  id: 'dlcb97'<br />Score:28<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dlcb97/how_pappu_is_caught_in_his_own_web_on_citizenship/</li>

If that's the case, then indian parents definitely have a say in their children's lives. Also, many westerners don't give their wealth to their children, but that isn't so in india. We all know that our parents' wealth is going to come to us.\n\nSo, what do you guys think of parents not being happy or deciding a partner for their children?

Copy pasting it. I will update it later on with the sometimes earth shaking changes we have made in these 4 short years. \n\nAlmost every day there is one, and sometimes multiple posts about how terrible India / Indian people / Roads / Political scenario etc are. I have no disputes with any of those because they are very valid and are pretty much true, but then as an "80\'s kid", I can only say that there has been a marked improvement on what things were 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago. What to say of 30-40 and above years ago.\n\nTake Politics - Are things bad? Yes they are. The opposition (be it the Congress and others in NDA, BJP and others in UPA and now back to Congress and the others in the NDA II) is simply stalling parliament. We have leaders like *insert your own most hated leader here* thriving. Our voters only vote mostly on casteist terms and essentially we are pretty much a failed democracy.\n\nBut are we? The collapse and doom of the Indian society and Indian democracy has been predicted for decades since 1947, but what is actually happening is a forward movement. A steady forward movement.\n\nEven 15 years ago, you had this thing called [Booth Capturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth_capturing). It essentially meant that the goons of a party would show up at a booth, \'capture\' it, stuff ballot boxes with votes for their party and then drive away to the next booth. This was not even an open secret, but pretty much done in camera. This is pretty much how regimes like the communist regimes the one in West Bengal had an unbroken run for 30 odd years. It was not just restricted to W.Bengal, but it took place in every single state.\n\nIt was not democracy but a goonacracy. It was only in 1989 was this actually made a crime punishable by law, and captured booths had reelections.\n\nPoll violence - It still happens, but is minor, but back in the day it was pretty much full fledged, goons and thugs would actually stand outside booths instructing people on how to vote, money and booze exchanged hands openly and the seat usually went to the guy who could pay the most. If one didn\'t comply with how the local goon wanted people to vote and or for various other reasons, you had outright rioting and violence and bandhs.\n\nWhat about the dumb populace who vote purely for identity based politics and caste you might ask? Even here, you can trace a bell curve type graph. In the period 47-80 the Congress pretty much held sway, but underneath that iron control, regional parties and regional / caste based identities started taking root. If you look at the casteist leaders (the popular ones) and identity based leaders of today, they all cut their teeth in this arena in the mid 70\'s to early 80\'s and by the mid 90\'s, the Laloo\'s, Mulayams\'s, Thackrey\'s were all out in force (identity based politics started earlier in TN, but that is the exception to the rule). This peaked in the late 80\'s to the late 90\'s (at the central level) and to a certain extent is continuing in some states to this day.\n\nAre things getting worse or are they actually changing for the better? What if I told you we are moving from purely caste / identity considerations to a mix of caste / identity and economic (the much derided around these parts "debolopment") considerations. \n\n[Quoting from this Carnegie Endowment](http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/06/23/understanding-indian-voter/iawy) paper to expand on this point.\n\n&gt;&gt;Good economics can make for good politics in India. While parochial considerations have long been thought to play a central role in shaping voters’ choices, evidence from state and national elections suggests that macroeconomic realities are increasingly relevant.\n\n&gt;&gt;Politicians who seek to gain strength using identity-based appeals alone have generally not fared well. While voters may harbor deep-seated social biases, identity-based concerns and economic evaluations are both in play. The most successful politicians have mastered the art of skillfully combining both types of appeals.\n\nEven if you look at the rise of AAP, even if is as of now centered only around Delhi / NCR and Punjab, it has been achieved without using identity / casteist politics. Previous movements which had similarities to AAP such as the rise of Laloo or even Mulayam all had to engineer casteist alliances to get their goal of reaching power. They did promise clean governance, an end to corruption, more access to those in power, but had to marry it to good ol caste / identity politics to actually make headway. Once they reach their goal, they then realised it was easier to actually just continue on their caste / identity agenda and seek reelection than actually work and seek reelection on their own merits.\n\nAll this is falling by the wayside. If you look at incumbency and agricultural growth (or degradation) there is a strong case that can be made for development politics, even if it remains rooted to caste based identity driven politics.\n\nLook at states that have over the past...10 years that have won reelections or conversely lost it, and look at agricultural growth or lack of it, and including the NDA I\'s disastrous "India Shining" campaign you will see that a politician / party can ignore the rural sector only at his peril. ABVP, Chandra Babu Naidu, Sonia / MMS are all text book cases of people (and parties) seeking reelection at a time of rural distress and losing miserably. At a state level, MP, Gujarat, Bihar (of Nitish) all had an upsurge in agri growth which then saw them being reelected. I could go into details, but it is of enough length to warrant its own individual topic.\n\nWe are the same India that 35 years ago had a rubber stamp parliament with a rubber stamp president veer dangerously close to having our own dictatorship. Ask yourself, do you even see that happening today? \n\nTo use an analogy, imagine you are this obese, 150 kg person starting on the Couch to 5k program. You are now on Week 2, Day 1. Things are horrible, you are wheezing too much, you sweat copious rivers of...well sweat, and then you see marathon runners who started training 20 years ago just effortlessly run past you (the First World nations), you see your previously obese neighbour who started his diet and other regimen 5 years before you effortlessly run a 10 mile marathon (China) and then you look at your pitiful performance and deride yourself (as you rightly should), but you should also look back on Week 1 Day 1, when you couldn\'t even take 5 steps forward without a threat of collapse. You are now able to jog for 60 seconds at a stretch. That is huge progress.\n\nSimilarly, the India of today  is struggling, suffering and horribly behind in almost every measure of a civilised nation, but do keep in mind, 50 years ago we had zero industry, 12% literacy rate and almost neglible exports (of the finished goods variety), and always on the verge of a famine without even having self sufficiency in food. We ran a controlled almost socialistic economy where phones were instruments only for the really rich and even then it took (as recently as 1990) upto a year or more to get one line and an instrument.\n\nTake systems and bureaucracy - Even 5 years ago, paying an electricity bill meant spending half a day in queue, bribing the lineman to cut your bills and no concept of electronic meters. Today? It is seamless, electronic meters give you an accurate and pretty much untamperable reading, and even if you are poor and have no internet connection, you could approach the neighbouring internet kiosk guy who will pay it online for you for an extra fee of Rs 10-25.\n\nLook at Passport Seva Kendras for one more instance of how things have improved, or even police systems. They are still brutal men for the most part, but there is more accountability built into the system. Take the example of the OP who called the police in Hyderabad. I can guarantee you that 5-10 years ago, the cops would have asked OP to go fuck himself. Even if you look at social changes, 10 years ago, one would dare not sit in the corner seats because...spit. Spit was everywhere, theatres today are far far far more cleaner.\n\nEven infrastructure, there has been a slow, but perceptible shift in our road network, or the availability of cheap commerical flights (our railways are still stuck in the 1970\'s though). I remember doing my first car ride to Bangalore in 1991. It was a 2 lane, with no median "National Highway". It took us 11 hours.\n\nNow? It is a 6 lane modern e-way which minus the assholes who don\'t follow rules (like the odd truck barelling down the wrong side), it is built to international standards, and the journey can be safely done in 4.5 hours (can be done sooner, but you need to violate our speed limit of 100 to achieve this)\n\nWe have a long way to go, but don\'t forget where we started in 1947.\n\nWe were in 1947, 500 tiny princely states, and major states had huge divides (language, culture and religion) resulting in every "seer" in the US and UK predicting doom. We had no industry to speak off, we were all illiterate for the most part. We were told that we will all fight and balkanise (you should read some of those alarmist articles, they are pretty funny) or the great famine will cull millions and then we will balkanise.\n\nInstead we threw up legends (good or bad) like Nehru, Patel, Sastri, Kamraj, Ambedkar and others who shaped and moulded our system and gave it strength. We had legends like Sarabhai who took us forward in science and tech. We had geniuses like M.S.Swaminathan (and of course, the eternally unsung Borlaug) who gave us the ability to feed ourselves. All this is also innovation and development, not just developing Apple or Google.\n\nLike I said, we have a long way to go, we have 300 Mn people going hungry every day. Our IMR is worse than large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, another 300 mn people are not connected to an electric grid....but if you plot these numbers for 1947, 1957, 1967 and every decade since, you will see a forward movement, and this movement has picked up steam since 1991 (thanks to the other unsung hero PVN).\n\nKeep the faith is all I can say.\n\nRequesting you to keep responses on topic and clean of political partisanship please.\n\nEdit - If you take data from 1973, India had a 3% share in the world GDP (down from 4.2% in 1950, thank you Indiraji), the UK had a 4.2% share. In 2010, India\'s share is 5.4% (a 1.4% increase in such large scales is huge) while the UK\'s is down to 2.9%. It is another matter that China went from 4% share in 1973 to a near 15% share in 2010. Our average GDP growth rate since 1947 has been ~ 4.5% (this includes the 2 decades of Hindu rate of growth under first Nehru and later Indira Gandhi). \n\nIn 1950 we produced 50 Mn tonnes of foodgrains, 1Mn tonnes of steel, 2.7Mn tonnes of cement, 32 Mn tonnes of coal and generated 6.6 Bkw of electricity.\n\nIn 2010 it is 257Mn tonnes of foodgrains (a 500% increase in 50 years), 73 Mn tonnes of steel, 223 Mn tonnes of cement, 500 Mn tonnes of coal and 1051 Bwwh of energy. In other words, we have added 21 BKW of electricity every year.\n\nThis is a textbook example of forward movement. We can complain about how power goes out for an hour or so a day (if you are in a city), and between 2-12 hours (depending on the state), but if you take TN as an example and narrow it down to my village (anecdotal I know), in 1987, we had power only for 8 hours a day in my village. One tap water connection for 4 streets, and water would come for only 45 minutes at any random point in the day. 1 in 10 houses might have had a telephone with maybe 1 in the whole village with STD facility. Roads in and around the place were terrible, non existent inside, 1 lane potholed highway with highway robbers operating in some parts (robbing lorries mostly). Going from Bodi to Madurai (70 km\'s) was an ordeal and took 3-4 hours.\n\nBy 2014, we have maybe an hour of outage every two days. Every house has tap water (sure it is not exactly safe to drink out of the tap, but if you had to trudge 3 kms to the village well to fetch water and then boil it, this is heaven) and we have a solid broadband connectivity to boot. Every road inside the village has been laid with cement and we have 4 lane state highways connecting to a 6 lane NH, and going to Madurai is a matter of an hour tops.\n\nIs this not progress? We can and should complain about how shitty the schools are, or how unsafe the drinking water is etc etc, we have a lot to complain about. We should complain about how an entire street has no electricity connection and have to use bootlegged connections, or how there is no proper sewage system, but do keep in mind, just 30 odd years ago, we didn\'t even have bijli, sadak nor pani.\n\nLike I said, keep the faith.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'dl1ew0'<br />Score:119<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/dl1ew0/how_india_has_changed_improved_for_the_better_in/</li>

I am saying this as a well wisher who wants India to progress. For all that matters, I've largely been center-right in India's context and I am pretty much against the left wing ideology.\n\nWhat concerns me is how divided we are as a nation right now. Things aren't that bad on ground level for now but we are massively polarised now owing to the magnitude of propaganda on social media, news channels as well as in inner religious circles.\n\nWe all have our disagreements with other ideologies. Even I have issues with some aspects of Islam but at the same time, I don't go around judging common Muslims based on that. I know plenty of Muslims and I've also done social work in Muslim localities. I didn't come across any person who wanted to demolish kaafirs or anything like that. All I met were common people who wanted to do well in their life and come out of poverty. I didn't meet any sorts of demons which is how common perception can often be these days.\n\nWe shouldn't forget the fact that Indian Muslims have had amongst the least terror recruitment so far. They've never supported Pakistan in any of the wars. We've had issues without doubt but even they have their grievances.\n\nThe only way we can progress is if we are all United. We can't exclude 20 crore of our population and 'otherise' them. It's bound to backfire. We also shouldn't forget that our neighbors as well as 'leftists media' loves these fault lines and want to exploit them. The best we can do is not give them enough fodder to exploit.
