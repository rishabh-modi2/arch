      <li>Title::: 'The genius of Peshwa Baji Rao 1 and his campaign against the Nizam'<br />Body: 'While I have covered in detail the concept of mobile warfare vs static warfare in my piece on the 1971 Bangladesh War, a brief intro is of the order here before moving on.\n\nBroadly speaking there are 3 types of warfare,\n\n(1) Static warfare with set piece (large eventful battles where an entire war is usually decided on the outcome of this 1 battle)\n\n(2) Mobile warfare - Warfare of the Mongols, Steppe tribes and of course the Marathas. In the modern era, Germany (Blitzkrieg) during WW2 and the USA since the 60\'s, esp their shock and awe campaigns in the gulf are all examples of these. In this lightly armoured (not applicable to modern warfare with tanks) but highly mobile cavalry would range far ahead of infantry (foot soldiers) and supply columns. These armies used their speed of movement to defeat larger, stronger but more cumbersome enemies. \n\n(3) Guerilla Warfare - This is when a much smaller force uses unconventional tactics such as ambushes, attacking enemy rear (which were harder to defend), attacking much weaker supply columns etc to weaken the much stronger \'conventional\' enemy.\n\nIf you are interested in this, you could look up my post on 1971 here where I go into extensive detail.\n\nSome of the finest military leaders often used a combination of all 3. A Caesar or Napoleon who headed large conventional armies often surprised their enemies by using mobility and showing up where they were least expected. \n\nLet me give you an example of how mobility works - Imagine you and 5 of your really strong friends are in a barfight against 10 much smaller people, you back yourself against the bar, rear protected, expecting the smaller group to attack you, knowing full well you can easily defend yourself and then counter attack crushing the larger but weaker group.\n\nNow imagine a scenario where this group keeps 3-4 of their guys near you, but out of reach, distracting you while the remaining group rushes out, sets your cars on fire, you then have to go defend your property, but by doing so you lose cohesion and also you are fighting now on their terms. You do it nonetheless, reach your cars but they are not there, but they are back in the bar, now harassing your girl friends, so you again decide to defend them, but split up this time, leaving half to defend the cars and the other half to get back to the bar. This time though the weaker team groups up, and overwhelm each group individually.\n\nThis in a very rough way is what mobility vs static warfare is (very very rough).\n\nWhile Indian armies traditionally have been associated with large, conscripted (not very well trained volunteers) armies of 10\'s of thousands of soldiers, many a time, as the situation has demanded, it has thrown up highly mobile cavalry based forces, some examples would be\n\nSkanda Gupta - famously converted his heavily infantry oriented army to an all cavalry one after fighting with the nomadic Huns (cavalry based armies) on the Gupta\'s North Western frontier, and used their own tactics to defeat them.\n\nHemu - Was like Napoleon in that he had a conventional army but used speed to be in places where his enemies least expected him to be.\n\nShivaji and the Marathas were a textbook case of #2 &amp; #3 (mobility married to unconventional warfare). Peshwa Baji Rao 1 was arguably one of the finest exponents of mobile warfare and it is him who we will briefly study, his campaigns rather.\n\nThe Background -\n\nRise of Nizam ul Mulk Asaf Jah I (Regulator of the country Equal to Asaf-Asaf was the minister to King Solomon apparently)- The Nizam was the viceroy (governor) of the Mughal empire, governing the deccan provinces. They levied the taxes, maintained armies and were an independent force but swore fealty to the Mughal Emperor. The Nizam in March 1721 was also made Vizier (Prime Minister) of the Empire, but the Nizam went beyond his brief and had his eyes on Malwa and Gujarat along with the Deccan, this would make him arguably the most powerful individual in the empire and the weak and pleasure loving emperor decided to act against him by transferring him to Awadh / Oudh. The Nizam knowing full well that this was a trap, agreed to be vizier and rule from Awadh, marched towards his new capital with his army but switched directions and moved on Hyderabad instead. The emperor now terrified, appointed a new governor to the Deccan, Mubariz Khan and ordered him to get the previous Nizam to come to terms. \n\nNow comes treachery upon treachery - Mubariz Khan ordered his own Nephew and commander of Aurangabad, Iwaz Khan to muster his forces and march against the former Nizam, Iwaz Khan though betrayed his own uncle to his enemy and switched sides. Aurangabad was Mubariz\'s capital, and this was lost. He was in alien territory (for him) with no access to reinforcements or supplies. The former Nizam then sent letters pleading for peace, uniting against the Hindu Marathas....but Mubariz Khan gave battle and lost badly, he and his sons were killed while the former Nizam went onto occupy Hyderabad.\n\nHe then wrote to the Emperor pleading his forgiveness and how he only wanted to defeat the Marathas etc etc. The emperor, not really having any choice, reappointed him governor of the Deccan. From the start though, the Nizam hated the Marathas and his sole aim  was to wipe them out as a force.\n\nThe Marathas, in their own act of switching sides (though this I would not call treachery as they were not bound to serve the emperor and were his enemies), even sent a contingent to fight alongside their hated enemy, the Nizam against Mubariz Khan. It was said by a Muslim chronicler Yusuf Khan that Bajirao himself had lead the contingent and was rewarded with a "mansabdari" (a title that came with an army of its own, sort of like a general) and other rich gifts.\n\nThe Trigger for the Campaign of Bajirao 1 against the Nizam.\n\nDuring the reign of the previous Peshwa, Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, the Marathas had forced the Mughal emperor Farrukshiyar to grant them,\n\n(1) Swarajya in their home country\n(2) Chauth - 1/4th of tax revenues from the Deccan\n(3) Sardesmuki - 1/10th of the revenues that went directly to the King\n\n....in the DECCAN! The Nizam, once his base was strengthened, flat out refused to hand over these sums and also supported a claimant to the Maratha throne, Sambahji of Kohlapur  (a grandson of Shivaji, but not the accepted ruler who was Chatrapathi Shahu Bhonsale)\n\nBoth these are also interesting stories, but that is for another day.\n\nThe Campaign - With the stage set, a powerful Nizam sent a demarche to the Marathas, saying no revenues, no deal and I recognise Sambaji as the rightful king. With the opening salvo shot, he took his very powerful, infantry and artillery (large, long ranged guns) based army to Pune, caused the rightful Chatrapati (Shahu) to flee, and placed Sambhaji there as his puppet king.\n\nOne point I missed on the Nizam though, prior to his humbling of the Emperor, the Deccan itself was divided into 6 \'subahs\' sub provinces, each with its own leader, and the Nizam\'s role was mostly ceremonial. With his victory, he removed all those divisions and ruled over what was essentially one powerful kingdom - this would have consequences that would impact India till 1947.\n\nThe NIzam did try to pin down the force of Bajirao though, before his occupation of Pune but the Peshwa lead the Nizam\'s armies on a wild goose chase that lasted 3 full months. It was an exhausted Nizam who then decided to play to his own strengths and make his enemy come to him and then decided to occupy Pune.\n\nIt worked...almost as the emperor Shahu sent a desperate summons to Bajirao whose armies were somewhere near modern day Gujarat  border in a place called Betawad (Maha), he ordered him to come to his (Shahu\'s) rescue. \n\nThe problem was, this was exactly what the Nizam was expecting, a large field (set piece) battle in which the lightly armed and armoured Marathas would get cut to pieces by his much more powerful and stronger force. So what did Bajirao do?\n\nHe used mobility! \n\nI will trace his movements from the time he heard of Nizam\'s march to show just how rapidly he moved,\n\nHe leaves Pune sometime in Nov mid, shows up in Berar Bihar by December 20th 1727 - a distance of 1,600 kms.\n\nDec 30th - Berar Bihar - Chopra West Bengal - 480 Kms \n\nFeb 11th - Chopra WB to Broach Gujarat - 2,000 kms in 42 days @ 42 kms / day which was unheard of for that era, and unmatched by most pre modern armeis. \n\nFrom there on it was easy going, he hit Surat, then reached the outskirts of Baroda before coming back to Maharastra, reaching Betawad by Feb 25th. \n\nSome 4k kms in 4 months, was just unheard off, and he was not just marching hither and tither wildly, these were all Mughal provinces, open and rich for looting which Bajirao did, thus drawing attention away from Pune to pretty much all over India. \n\nHe then surprised the Nizam by directly marching on an undefended Aurangabad (a key Nizam city and the capital), reaching the district of Bijapur and spreading his army out like a swarm of locusts - he attacked the very heart of Nizam territory. \n\nThis caused panic in the Nizam and he ordered a full scale retreat from Pune to Aurangabad to face his foe.\n\nHis foe...like Houdini had once again disappeared though. Striking deeper in Nizam territory.\n\nThe Nizam exasperated gave up, ordered his artillery and most of his supply baggage (these things are heavy and slow down the pace of a march) and ordered his light infantry and cavalry to pursue the Peshwa. \n\nDid the Peshwa now engage his much weakened and at on par enemy? Hardly, the Nizam had strength of numbers, so Bajirao now shifted to Guerilla warfare - he had his men split up, use terrain and relentlessly hammered the Nizams flanks and rear, as also whatever supply columns he could manage. \n\nThe Deccan as you would know is very dry, and there are fixed places with good water supply, and these the Peshwa targeted and everytime units of the Nizam went to gather water, they were destroyed piecemeal.\n\nBy constantly hounding and harassing the weaker but still strong Nizam\'s army, Bajirao maneuvered the Nizam and his army to a drought ridden area called Palkhed and over a weak, entirely surrounded them. \n\nThe Nizam was done in, through Iwaz Khan (the same guy who had betrayed his uncle) sent word that he was ready to discuss peace terms. Bajirao then magnanimously allowed the Nizam\'s army to move near a water source, while negotiations commenced.\n\nThe treaty of Munji Shivagaon though was a humiliating defeat for the Nizam, he\n\n(1) Recognised Shahu as the only Maratha Emperor\n(2) Agreed to pay Chauth and Sardesmuki\n(3) All past dues would also be settled.\n\nThus without fighting a single pitched battle, just by using movement, the genius of Peshwa Bajirao defeated a much larger, heavily armed and heavily gunned army of the Nizam.\n\nCouple of points - I have used Dodwell\'s history as a source for tracing his movements and I am definitely suspect about Bengal. It is possible that British spelling from 1920 and modern spellings are different. I have looked up a history of the Maharattas by Duff and the movements in Gujarat and Maharashtra are accurate and can be verified. \n\nI have purposely not quoted Montgomery on Bajirao\'s campaign as I have not read a direct source attributing him, if anyone has such a source, would appreciate it if you can point me in that direction. \n\nI would like to animate these moves if possible as they make for a more compelling read as otherwise you will have to be like Jadunath Sarkar who apparently got great joy in tracking all these on giant maps he had. So if you know animation, pm me.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'f2nwq4'<br />Score:132<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f2nwq4/the_genius_of_peshwa_baji_rao_1_and_his_campaign/</li>

I know this happens back home too, but there\'s always been a "getting to know each other" period after they\'re introduced by their families. Apparently they don\'t follow that here. Kid gratuates, find him/her and boy/girl get them married in a couple of months, without them even really getting to know each other. \n\nAll these things and more are the reasons why these "ABCDs" hate Indian culture and do everything to distance themselves from it, because they see it as something controlling and oppressive, and something that gives them absolutely no choices in how their lives should be lived. \n\nI would have really thought the Desi parents here would be more open minded and accepting, but what I\'ve learned is, people in India are actually more open minded, belive it or not. \n\nAs a guy that grew up in Mumbai, me, nor my friends, nor people from Mumbai had their parents had their kids pushed into ONLY making friends from their religion or castes.\nMy female friends and sister back home dress however they want, date whoever they pick, work/get an education in their areas of interest, while the "ABCD" girls are forced and some times even threatened to dress how their parents want them to. \nChoosing a job or education is more than likely always based on their parents choices. Guys and girls aren\'t allowed to date, unless their parents approve their partner\'s background, that is based on a very orthodox way of a "background check". They\'re kept an extremely close eye on when not in the house, just to make sure their kids didn\'t lie and godforbid, go out with their friends and do something they liked. And all of this happens well into their 20s or until they get hitched. \n\nACBDs can\'t fart unless their parents allow them to tbh. \n\nI could go on all day about all the things I\'ve observed with them, but that\'s too much typing lol, so yeah, some insight on why Desi parents over here are just so damn orthodox/close minded/conservative when it comes to their children, compared to the ones back home, would be appreciated.'<br />Author: 'megalodon_fart'  id: 'f2m48b'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f2m48b/why_are_indian_parents_in_the_us_so_aggressively/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Thapar family and their connections'<br />Body: "  \n\n**Karan Thapar** (journalist of The Wire / Hindustan Times) is cousin brother of Romila Thapar (so-called eminent historian) and was a close friend of Sanjay Gandhi.  \n \\--\n\nKaran Thapar's own Mamiji (Mother’s brother’s wife) is **Nayantara Sahgal** (recently famed for spearheading 'award wapasi' and yelling 'Rising intolerance in India'). Nayantara is the daughter of Vijaylakshmi Pundit and niece of Jawaharlal Nehru!   \n \\--\n\nKaran's father **Pran Nath Thapar** joined the British Indian Army in 1926.  He was made Chief of Army Staff by Nehru In 1961. General Pran Nath Thapar served as an Indian Army chief, under whose leadership India lost a war against China in 1962, forcing him to resign in disgrace on 19 November that year..  \n \\--\n\nKaran's nana (mother's father) was ‘Diwan Bahadur’ **Kunj Bihari Thapar**, who was a commission agent of the British (and a British stooge) during the First World War and became wealthy due to this. Kunj Behari Thapar also (one of four people who donated Rs 1.75 lakh to the fund of Punjab governor Sir Michael O’Dwyer — the man who backed the actions of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919).   \n For loyalty during Jallianwala crisis, Kunj Behari Thapar was awarded the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1920! \n\n\\--\n\n**Romila Thapar** is of course, a famous “top” typical JNU Nehruvian communist ideologue historian, who gets to  write our textbooks and pollute them with pro-Congress Marxist  propaganda. \n\nRomila Thapar had in the Social Science Books of NCERT Class 9th/10th depicted martyrdom of Guru Teg Bahadur as a result of his growing military and terror activities against the then regime. Very shame full and anti Sikh.\n\nRomila’s standing and influence as a historian was largely based on repeating the discredited theory of Aryans invading India. As previously proved by NS Rajaram Romila hardly  knows any Sanskrit, let alone Vedic Sanskrit, and her entire research on  India is built on 19th century translations  of Vedas and the Puranas, done mostly by colonial era scholars who gave these a racial interpretation. As expected this theory of the Aryan invasion collapsed under rigourous scientific scrutiny.  \n \n\nAnother highlight of Romila’s career as a historian was her attempt to prove the non-existence of the temple in the disputed site of Ayodhya, which was of course proved wrong with ample evidence.   \n   \n \\--\n\nKaran’s another first cousin is **Romesh Thapar** (own brother of Romila Thapar) was a communist. Thapar served as director of the India International Centre, of the National Books Development Board, of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), and as vice-chairperson of the National Bal Bhavan, all of which are government positions conferred on him due to him being close to Indira Gandhi. Started by Romesh Thapar, Seminar magazine continues to be published from Delhi, brought out by Romesh Thapar’s daughter **Malavika Singh** and her husband **Tejbir Singh** and is a LOYAL platform for the Congress ecosystem. Tejbir Singh is the grandson of ‘Sir’ Sobha Singh (Big civil contractor during British times and a British stooge). \n\n\\--\n\nSir **Sobha Singh**, a key witness in the bomb explosion in Parliament on 8 April 1929. It was Sobha Singh who identified Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt during his sketchy testimony, as a result of which Bhagat Singh (the great freedom fighter) was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Sobha Singh, the only witness in the Delhi Assembly Bomb Case, claimed that he had actually seen Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt hurling the bomb. Significantly during his cross examination his version was found to be doubtful and the session judge in his judgement has hinted to that affect.\n\nSubsequently on Sobha Singh’s testimony, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were sent to gallows\n\nSobha Singh was knighted by the British some years after Bhagat Singh’s trial. \n\n\\--\n\nThe famous Khushwant Singh (journalist &amp; writer) was the son of Sir Sobha Singh. **Khushwant Singh** was a vocal Indira Gandhi supporter and known to be the most open Emergency apologist. Khushwant Singh’s son **Rahul Singh** can easily be found on NDTV or some other news channels defending the serious sexual/criminal offenders, the likes of Tarun Tejpal, Testa Setalwad and R.K. Pachauri.  \n \n\n\\--\n\nThis is the crowd which had and still continuing to have the very best of both worlds, kowtowing the British colonials, “more loyal than the king” and then enjoying the choicest fruits of freedom not shedding a drop of blood, a drop of tear; appropriating blood, sweat, and tears of freedom fighters. \n\n\\--\n\nSources &amp; references: \n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/diplomacy/story/19970901-jallianwala-case-manner-in-which-britain-dealt-with-perpetrators-evoked-sharp-criticism-830477-1997-09-01](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/diplomacy/story/19970901-jallianwala-case-manner-in-which-britain-dealt-with-perpetrators-evoked-sharp-criticism-830477-1997-09-01)\n\n[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/13547/page/28/data.pdf](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/13547/page/28/data.pdf)\n\n[https://shwetankspad.com/2016/03/14/loyal-descendants/](https://shwetankspad.com/2016/03/14/loyal-descendants/)\n\n[https://www.pgurus.com/hushed-up-history-in-the-trial-of-revolutionaries-bhagat-singh-sukhdev-and-rajguru/](https://www.pgurus.com/hushed-up-history-in-the-trial-of-revolutionaries-bhagat-singh-sukhdev-and-rajguru/)\n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-people-who-identified-Bhagat-Singh-in-court](https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-people-who-identified-Bhagat-Singh-in-court)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romesh\\_Thapar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romesh_Thapar)\n\n[https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/how-bhagat-singh-was-sentenced-based-on-the-testimony-of-kushwant-singhs-father-/298316](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/how-bhagat-singh-was-sentenced-based-on-the-testimony-of-kushwant-singhs-father-/298316)"<br />Author: 'apadipodu'  id: 'f2am4p'<br />Score:100<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f2am4p/thapar_family_and_their_connections/</li>

It was a contract between two person with no interference from third person. This is how marriage should be in modern society. And if a person breaks the contract (i.e breaks the marriage) then he has to pay a predecided amount of money to the other party. \n\nWhile Hindu marriage law is nothing but a organised extortion racket run by the govt where if you get married , your wife can do anything she wants and you will still have to pay her money on monthly basis otherwise you will have to rot in jail forever. Basically you wife can have affairs with other men , abuse you emotionally,  and you can't do anything. You will have to live with her or pay her money a monthly basis plus even half of your net worth . And this thing is applicable even if you are married for a day . it is nothing but organised extortion racket by the state. \n\nif you are a hindu then you have to be biggest fool to enter into marriage under present laws .

Everyday, it is traversed by thousands of people, but few know or care that the bridge is named after an unsung Indian hero, Shri Ravindra Hareshwar Mhatre. \n\nHe was brutally killed by Kashmiri terrorists at d age of 48 while he was serving as a diplomat in the Indian Embassy in Birmingham UK.\n\nRavindra Mhatre was abducted and killed in an attempt to negotiate release of terrorist Maqbool Bhat of the Jammu &amp;Kashmir Liberation Front. Yes,the same #MaqboolBhat, in whose name separatist slogans were raised in JNU. \n\nMhatre was kidnapped as he was stepping out of a baker's shop after picking up a birthday cake for his daughter. Mhatre's daughter was only 14 when he disappeared forever from her life. Her father's body was found three days later on a sidestreet in Birmingham. \n\nThe then PM Indira Gandhi refused to negotiate with the terrorists and Maqbool Bhat was hanged to death days after Mhatre's body was found.\n\nA few months after that, Smt. Gandhi visited Mhatre's ageing parents in Vikroli, Mumbai and allegedly said to them that on a personal level, she was guilty of taking their son away from them, but her hands were tied. In an emotional story, Mhatre's daughter talks about how her father's murder changed her life forever. *The Kashmiri terrorists haven't forgotten Maqbul Bhat, but we Indians have forgotten Ravindra Mhatre.*\n\nConclusion: *Shared to revive the memory of the patriot Hon.

      <li>Title::: 'What would the uniting force in local communities be for a post-religious India?'<br />Body: "I think we can all agree that younger generations show less interest in religion/religious activities compared to older people. This is not just a trend in India but its happening worldwide. I myself only partake in religious rituals out of respect for the elders in my family.\n\nI routinely talk to my grandparents about their good ol' days. One thing I've noticed is that in their good ol days religion used to give people an excuse to meet up. People living in the same society/locality/district would gather to do partake in religious activities. Not saying that bhajans were the **only** thing that brought them together but, they certainly were the main. A lot of them would be held weekly, some every other day. They played the same role that Sunday church plays in western countries and some parts of India. Even today it seems like old India unkills and aunties seem to get together mainly for some sort of religious activities though I may be wrong.\n\nThe only excuses I've personally had to meet up with people who live nearby have been sports and coaching classes/ tuition. And since I don't really do those anymore I've started seeing less and less of people around me.\n\nSo my question to my fellow indians is, what stuff do you do to stay involved in the local community? What activities do you think would replace religion in the coming decades as a uniting force for local communities? Do you think local urban neighborhoods would start losing that sense of community in the coming years?\n\nNote that my family has lived in a major Indian city for a few generations, so my observations might be a bit biased and not apply to villages."<br />Author: 'butAblip'  id: 'f1bqnr'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f1bqnr/what_would_the_uniting_force_in_local_communities/</li>

This has lead to misgovernance and a lack of sub-national identity. The state has atrocious HDI, Income, life expectancy and crime statistics.\n\nIf one were to look at the Planning Commission’s comparative data from the 12th Five-Year Plan, UP lies at the bottom of the stack among the 15 major states in the country. Irrespective of what parameter one chooses, from growth rate to investments made in the economy to any of the social welfare indices—UP resides at the bottom.\n\nAdditionally, the state has noticeable inequalities within its boundaries, most noticeably between eastern UP and western UP, with most regions in eastern UP being classified as backward areas.\n\nGiven the size of the state—both in terms of geography as well as population—such a move will allow for better political representation and bring the administration closer to people. With roughly 200 million people in the state, a single government, a single chief minister simply can’t be expected to do justice to the competing demands. And without political will and involvement, it is naïve to expect any improvements in UP.\n\nThe idea behind partitioning UP is to make governance more granular, responsive and down to earth. The notion of one man controlling the fate of 200 million whom he cannot possibly know, only creates the “mai baap" culture where people from distant places go begging before leaders who don’t really empathize with them.\n\nLarge sections of this article are taken from a livemint\xa0 article by the name "Why Uttar Pradesh should be split" by udit Mishra ([https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/pvoBRRu9Dsd9fwwtJYQMwO/Why-Uttar-Pradesh-should-be-split.html](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/pvoBRRu9Dsd9fwwtJYQMwO/Why-Uttar-Pradesh-should-be-split.html)'<br />Author: 'Polar007'  id: 'f0ol5d'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f0ol5d/petition_to_split_the_state_of_uttar_pradesh/</li>

This theory is supported by genetics, archeology and linguistics, but many Indian historians and religious scholars dispute it. **Assuming that the theory is true, how different would India be if the migration of Steppe pastoralists, who arrived during the Vedic age (1500-500BCE), didn't happen?** Here are my predictions, feel free to comment on them:\n\n1)**It means that genetically, Indians would be very similar to Indus Valley people**\\- There won't be ANI ancestry in the Indian gene pool, so most Indians would have a darker complexion, smaller body frame, possibly less hairy but a thicker hair. A lot more Indians may also have East Asian features, especially in regions close to the Northeast. \n\n2) **Indian religion would be different**\\- Without the influence of Vedas, what would have existed in India is animism and a different kind of polytheism, where every village has a local deity and in most cases, it is a Goddess. So Shaktism would exist, without Vedic influence of course. Some say Shaivism also predates the Vedic age, judging by some artifacts from IVC, so worship of Lingam and Lord Shiva may exist in a different version. Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism may not have existed, or existed in a very different way as an alternative to pre-Vedic Hinduism. \n\n3)**Dravidian and East Asian languages would dominate the Subcontinent**\\- Without the existence of Sanskrit and later Indo-Aryan languages, what would've existed is possibly a hybrid between Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic languages.\n\n4)**There won't be a cows and other domesticated animals in India**\\- Without pastoral culture and knowledge, there won't be herding profession and all the domesticated animals that comes with it. Indian food will be very different without milk, ghee, butter, paneer, mutton, lamb, etc. Horses wouldn't exist till a later age and clothing made of sheep wool wouldn't exist. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'f0nps6'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f0nps6/what_is_the_impact_of_prevedic_people_in_modern/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'In an alternative world where there is no Islam in India, do you think BJP or Hindutva will exist or be as popular?'<br />Body: "My guess would be **a resounding yes,** for both the questions. \n\nIndia's problem with Islam is not really its teachings, that's actually a symptom and not the problem itself. **India's root problem with Islam the fact that it is a foreign religion and has too much influence in the Indian subcontinent.** Its the same reason why the majority community also have a problem with Christianity, although to a smaller extent because the population is smaller. \n\nIt really goes back to geography. Indians are monsoon people, whereas Islam is a desert religion. People who live different climates develop cultures and beliefs that suit their environment. A certain foreign belief can be adopted and localized, but typically with Civilizational states like India or China, the resistance against anything foreign is very strong. \n\nSo for example, if Zoroastrianism instead of Islam became the dominant religion of the Middle East and 30% of South Asians today practice that religion, my guess is that 1) Because of its desert-origin, it will be a lot more similar than we think to the way Islam is practiced today and 2) The majority of Indians will react just as strongly against the influence of this religion as today. Right-wing parties and ideologies will emerge in order to conserve the local way of life."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'f0aue9'<br />Score:8<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f0aue9/in_an_alternative_world_where_there_is_no_islam/</li>

      <li>Title::: '[Debate] Genetically modified food - Bad for health? Or is this fear unfounded?'<br />Body: "[Genetically modified food - Is the fear unfounded?](https://preview.redd.it/uejgcopvvgf41.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d2a4e8c61ca80d25c3a8e736945ed435e280db1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Preface**\n\nGenetically modified (GM) foods have been around for decades. Created by modifying the DNA of one organism through the introduction of genes from another, they are developed for a number of different reasons—to fight disease, enhance flavor, resist pests, improve nutrition, survive drought—and are mainly found in our food supply in processed foods using corn, soybeans, and sugar beets, and as feed for farm animals. Selective breeding is basically a hit or miss, however genetic engineering eliminates this factor and we can choose the traits we want. Maybe, a corn with big kernels but thin stock, immune to pests by producing its own pesticides that may kill selective bacteria, virus but immune to humans or BT Crops.\n\n***So why are people concern about them?*** *Allele flow or gene flow*. [^(harvard.edu)](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/challenging-evolution-how-gmos-can-influence-genetic-diversity/)  It is the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another that may result in unwanted new characteristics into them. This situation would be detrimental because the GMOs would grow faster and reproduce more often, allowing them to take resources away from non-GMO relatives if they inhabit the same environment.  The environmental threats include the possibility of cross-breeding with other plants, harm to non-target organisms, and decreased biodiversity. In addition, the current regulatory system does not adequately assess the safety of GM crops and we cannot be sure of what the long-term effects of consumption will be.\n\nThen there are plants that are resistant to certain weed killers  herbicides. It is due to this fact, farmers are now increasing the use of certain weedicides such has glyphosate which might *amplify intensive than expansive farming*. This in turn increases the business and profits of huge chemical corporations that control our food supply. Hence, there is a **need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model**.\n\nIn 1990, the *papaya industry in* **Hawaii** was under attack from Ringspot virus that threatened to wipe out the Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a genetically modified papaya modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. On a larger scale scientists are trying to engineers *plants that are more resilient to climate change* such as the one in **Tanzania** [^(cornell.edu)](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2017/02/visiting-tanzanias-first-ever-gmo-crop-trial/) Farmers in **India** have now rapidly adopted the *cultivation of Bt cotton* crops [^(allresearchjournal)](http://www.allresearchjournal.com/archives/2016/vol2issue7/PartL/2-7-73-386.pdf) There have been innovations in modifications of **American** Chestnut trees to make them become super-effective carbon collectors [^(theconversation)](https://theconversation.com/new-genetically-engineered-american-chestnut-will-help-restore-the-decimated-iconic-tree-52191)\n\nKeeping the above points in mind, do you think they are they safe? How do they impact the environment? Can they improve food security? Is the world better off with or without GM food?\n\n**Those in favor of the motion can begin their defense/arguments with \\[For\\].**\n\n**Those who are against this motion can begin their criticism / arguments with \\[Against\\].**"<br />Author: 'nipples_brown_area'  id: 'f07ysy'<br />Score:34<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f07ysy/debate_genetically_modified_food_bad_for_health/</li>

Even though cases were reported from only two districts of Kozhikode and Malappuram, where fruit bats - a possible source of the virus - were breeding, the surveillance net was rapidly scaled up to neighbouring districts as well.\nThe government issued advisories, updated it on the Health Ministry website, and shared it with all states. The World Health Organisation (WHO) commended Kerala\'s "strong health system" and emergency preparedness that enabled it to contain the spread.\n\n&gt;Mr Rajeev Sadanandan, the former health secretary who helmed Kerala\'s response to Nipah virus, said: "Frankly, there were two embarrassing things in the Nipah experience. One, that we missed the index case."\n\n&gt;The first person who turned up with the symptoms died before his sample could be collected.\n"Two, a lot of infections happened in the hospital setting. Both are not signs of a good health system," said Mr Sadanandan, who now chairs health systems research at the Indian Council of Medical Research.\nTo avoid repeating its mistakes, Kerala created structures like isolation centres and "cuff corners" to prevent hospital-acquired infections. For faster detection, the state also developed case definitions of emerging pathogens and established response protocols.\n"A suspect\'s samples will be taken and verified against the predetermined set of pathogens. When it is not one of them, we assume it is \'Pathogen X\', which is how WHO defines an unknown virus. If the samples test positive for a known virus, we trace everyone the patient has been in contact with, isolate them, observe and follow up for the 15 days incubation period," explained Mr Sadanandan.\nAs news of the coronavirus outbreak in China emerged in January, Kerala became "extra vigilant", the Health Minister said.\nWithin a week, the state set up a health desk in all four\xa0of its airports to screen international passengers, who are given a health card to fill out with details of their travel and health.\n\n&gt;People with fever, cough or sore throat - symptoms of the coronavirus infection - are taken for examination by medical practitioners, and quarantined for observation.\n"Nipah came out of the blue, while 2019-novel coronavirus was very much expected as several Kerala students from Wuhan, China came back to Kerala in early January 2020 for the Chinese New Year vacation and then due to the outbreak. So, preparedness was better," said Mr G. Arunkumar, director of the Manipal Institute of Virology in Mahe, who had helped identify the Nipah virus early.\nAs of Feb 3, 2,239 people are isolated and under surveillance in Kerala. Of these, three people, from different regions of the state but all with a history of travel to Wuhan, tested positive for the virus.'<br />Author: 'SandyB92'  id: 'f02rfk'<br />Score:89<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/f02rfk/coronavirus_indias_kerala_state_spots_cases_early/</li>

The guy agreed with her saying (in Hindi) “now call the BJP guys, they’ll have no option but to negotiate with us”. That’s where things stood were it not for @DelhiPolice who were monitoring social media. The #ShaheenBagh cops don’t arrest\nbecause then the terrorists gherao the station. So they had to send someone from Sarita Vihar station. The organisers refused to hand her over. This obviously is a CLEAR CUT CASE OF KIDNAPPING &amp; HOSTAGE TAKING. This “hatta gatta” jaat lady cop tried twice to force her way in\n\nBut was PUSHED BACK!!! Can you imagine? This was when the police decided to threaten a lathi charge. Gunja distinctly remembers the Man there saying “if they lathi charge that’ll be the end of the protest”. This is when their little hostage taking/blackmail drama ended....\n\nEven here she wasn’t simply allowed to go. Some of “upasana”’s gang also pinched her viciously &amp; tried holding her back because they wanted the hostage situation to continue.\n\nUnderstand what happened here\n1) repeated physical assault\n2) theft of phone &amp; cash\n3) seizure of government ID\n4) kidnapping\n5) hostage taking\n6) blackmail\nAll of which are punishable by years in jail. Not to mention how her phone &amp; aadhar will be misused. \n\nFinally a lot of people are digging up her tweets &amp; attributing motives. I’ve known her &amp; been her friend through her AAP &amp; INC phases. The earliest conversation I remember was from 2016 &amp; through that period she was constantly abused in both parties for her HINDU beliefs. If you want to focus on her public statements then, fine .. but also acknowledge she left both because she wasn’t going to stand for a viciously hinduphobic environment &amp; finally also remember she refused to convert &amp; say the kalima to save herself when surrounded by a lynch mob. \n\nSource: https://twitter.com/Iyervval/status/1225456261530931200'<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'ezv5lx'<br />Score:31<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ezv5lx/just_had_a_long_chat_with_gunjakapoor_gunjakapoor/</li>

      <li>Title::: '"The leader and prophet of this bourgeoisie is Gandhi. A fake leader and a false prophet!" - Trotsky on Gandhi, 1939'<br />Body: 'An excerpt from *An Open Letter to the Workers of India* written in July,1939 by [Leon Trotsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky) :\n\n&gt; The Indian bourgeoisie is incapable of leading a revolutionary struggle. They are closely bound up with and dependent upon British capitalism. They tremble for their own property. They stand in fear of the masses. They seek compromises with British imperialism no matter what the price and lull the Indian masses with hopes of reforms from above. The leader and prophet of this bourgeoisie is Gandhi. A fake leader and a false prophet! Gandhi and his compeers have developed a theory that India’s position will constantly improve, that her liberties will continually be enlarged and that India will gradually become a Dominion on the road of peaceful reforms. Later on, perhaps even achieve full independence. This entire perspective is false to the core. The imperialist classes were able to make concessions to colonial peoples as well as to their own workers, only so long as capitalism marched uphill, so long as the exploiters could firmly bank on the further growth of profits. Nowadays there cannot even be talk of this. World imperialism is in decline. The condition of all imperialist nations daily becomes more difficult while the contradictions between them become more and more aggravated. Monstrous armaments devour an ever greater share of national incomes. The imperialists can no longer make serious concessions either to their own toiling masses or to the colonies. On the contrary, they are compelled to resort to an ever more bestial exploitation. It is precisely in this that capitalism’s death agony is expressed. To retain their colonies, markets and concessions, from Germany, Italy and Japan, the London government stands ready to mow down millions of people. Is it possible, without losing one’s senses, to pin any hopes that this greedy and savage financial oligarchy will voluntarily free India?\n\n\nRead the complete letter [here.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/07/india.htm)'<br />Author: 'LichchaviPrincess'  id: 'eysvew'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eysvew/the_leader_and_prophet_of_this_bourgeoisie_is/</li>

But shit still gets out of hands as jihadis and anti nationals start making speeches about breaking apart India. So, what do you do hire shooters. But then the media finds out the shooters were members of AAP themselves. Matlab yaar kuch bhi for power. Could have talked about development or anything. Lekkin ghanta tha for showing off.

I found the source for it is based on a saying of Islam\'s prophet Mohammad.\n\nIt is Sunan An-Nasai 1:25:3177 ([https://muflihun.com/nasai/25/3177](https://muflihun.com/nasai/25/3177)). I\'ve put the link so you can read the hadith yourself.\n\nIt is an considered a good hadith (saying of Mohammad). The interpretation of the majority of scholars seems to be that it is a hadith referring to the end of days, where one of the muslim groups who will saved from Hell by Allah are the ones who invade India. \n\nSo if this Hadith is really accurate, which majority of Islamic scholars seem to think it is (rated Hasan), then Islam teaches these Islamic terrorists that if they invade India and they are successful then it is a sign of the end times and that they will be saved from Hell. This would seem to indicate that Islam as a religion is itself to blame for Islamic terrorism against India. \n\n\\[NOTE: If true this would be a critique against Islam the religion, NOT against all Muslims in general as people. All ideas including Islam are fair game to be criticized, but every individual human must be judged as an individual always. If you wish to criticize an individual Muslim for this then you would first need to find out if they hold this specific belief to be true\\]\n\nEveryone from globally recognised terrorist Hafiz Saeed to Pakistani MP\'s and Generals seem to be calling for Ghazwa-e-Hind which is based on this Hadith.

This reality first became evident not in China, but Japan. \n\nPeople forget that although Japan has been democratic since 1948, one party (LDP) has been ruling almost continuously till today. Besides Japan and China, Thailand is being ruled today by a military Junta that took over in 2014. Many people discredited the military government but after 6 years, the country is doing great; Thai economy and currency have been among the best performers in the region. **One thing all these countries have in common is a very low level of resistance from the public against government policies.**\n\nI feel like successive Congress leaders got fooled by Western political history into believing that the best form of government for a developing country is a democratic one. India actually paid a dear price for having too much freedom and democracy; so many reforms couldn't get implemented over the decades because there's so much activism in the parliament all the way to the streets. **But slowly, I feel like Indian leaders are figuring out what works and what doesn't.** Indian people are also putting more faith in leaders who can get things done, regardless of how moral and ethical their agenda is."<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'eykmzd'<br />Score:9<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eykmzd/governance_is_more_important_for_india_than/</li>

I studied science in the 11th and 12th std and since I didn't want to work in a science oriented field, I decided to go for something else. I chose economics because I assumed it would be challenging along with the fact that I enjoy mathematics. But now I've realised that I would never want to work in the Economics field and would prefer working in the commerce/business sector. I'm constantly beating myself over the fact that I didn't go for B.Com or BBA and it hurts to see my friends who are doing these courses , perform well. My course seems useless and I feel insecure and scared that I won't be able to secure a job upon graduating.\n\nSimultaneously I've always wanted to join the Armed Forces and the B.A helps in preparing me for the entrance exam to do so. But joining the Armed Forces is not a sure thing itself due to the amount of scrutiny one undergoes. I'm also a part of the NCC and absolutely love every second of it. \n\nSo finally my question boils down to the title. As an economics major , am I placed at a significant disadvantage when it comes to securing a job in this competitive society? Should I drop my course and pursue a degree which I have now come to realise that I would prefer and enjoy? If I drop my course now , that would imply that I give up on the NCC and my dream of joining the Armed Forces because a year of seniority in the Armed Forces is paramount."<br />Author: 'Lavosier'  id: 'ey91ll'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ey91ll/how_much_does_your_undergrad_major_play_a_role_in/</li>

He seeks trouble, and wears clothes that make others think he is a thug or someone not to be messed with (bubble goose jacket). When trouble comes, of course, he attempts to evade to the best of his ability.\n\n&gt;  \nAvoiding the forces destroying the fruits of his seed  \nEmployed by the streets he was working for free  \nMotivated by greed, green sacks he would smoke up  \nAnd sell to common folk who like toking (smoking) it, on the reg (regular)\n\nEssentially, this individual was wasting his life, living selfishly and not really doing much at all.\n\n&gt;  \nAy yo, shots fly he pray one, reach his head\n\nWhen this individual was in a gunfight, he had a death-wish.\n\n&gt;  \nBlood pours he caught on in the leg, now  \nWhere he run to, crippled, simple minded  \nLived in the city and, dreamed of dying  \nPromoted death, with every single breath  \nBut now his breath is getting short and he\'s scared  \nShaking in his boots as he pulls out his hair  \nGot what he wanted but he wasn\'t prepared  \nCrying, realizing he don\'t wanna die\n\nWell, in this gunfight, the individual was shot in the leg and now death was a real possibility for him. He became fearful, and though he once thought he was fearless of death, when confronted with the reality of the situation, he realized he wanted to live.\n\n&gt;  \nHe\'s nobody, and me and him are so much alike\n\nThis individual was of no significance to society, yet what he experienced was one of the most universal human experiences. The fear of death is, in fact, the ultimate fear, as it is the deep unknown, deeper than any ocean and deeper than the limits of space and time - it is THE unknown, the ultimate fear.

It seems though everyone is quite fake, playing a role, acting, ("act" is the root of the word "action" after-all!), so much so that not only are they dishonest to others but also to themselves. It often may seem as though people are unwilling to give, not only physically but also their skills, intellect, and wisdom. Often, even the gurus are asking for a price.\n\n&gt;  \nNobody wants to live, nobody wants to fight  \nNobody chooses sides standing for what\'s right  \nNobody sees color beyond black and white\n\nThese days, it may seem as though nobody puts in a true effort to do good for the sake of doing good.

      <li>Title::: 'Dharmic Translation/Commentary - Translating Hip Hip lyrics to outline the Dharmic concepts they touch upon - This is poetry. First up: Light Show by Pigeon Hole (feat. D-Sisive). Feel free to comment your own.'<br />Body: '1. Listen to the song while reading along with the lyrics in the description:\n\n[Pigeon Hole - Light Show (feat. D-Sisive)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb1PInruc5I)\n\n2) Read through the following translations:\n\nBefore we go into the translation, know that this song is giving examples of troubles Aatmas that are calling to Brahman to be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, moksha. Some may think that this is a bit exaggerated, but if you look into the other lyrics of this group you will see that they are Dharmically aware and very straight to the point, just how I like it; the thing I point out are not coincidences. I\'m not going to translate every single lyric, just what really made an impression on me:\n\n**Author #1**\n\n&gt;Its a new day our time to champion  \n&gt;  \n&gt;act like you know its the anthem  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Its a new day our time to champion  \n&gt;  \n&gt;act like you know its the anthem  \n&gt;  \n&gt;get ready for the light show  \n&gt;  \n&gt;thunders coming  \n&gt;  \n&gt;yep, yep get ready  \n&gt;  \n&gt;thunders coming  \n&gt;  \n&gt;yep, yep get ready  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some say i\'ve got devils  \n&gt;  \n&gt;caged in my bones, so unsettled  \n&gt;  \n&gt;can\'t sleep they\'ve got a hold won\'t let go  \n&gt;  \n&gt;scream like treble heavy death metal  \n&gt;  \n&gt;all night alright i\'ve a little bit damaged yes  \n&gt;  \n&gt;out to lunch and short a couple sandwiches\n\nIn the Kali Yuga, our mind drifts from Brahman. Whether this is true or not, this lyric indicates that the individual has two conflicting parts, one of which he describes as the Self, the Aatma, and the other that he describes as "devils" aka the animalistic nature, which he depicts as being in conflict with his Aatma leading to worldly troubles. In this case, the author refers to himself as having an emotional disorder, bulimia.\n\n&gt;a walking gallery come check the canvases  \n&gt;  \n&gt;if you think you can hang if you can handle this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;but most cannot  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and thats right where the boasting stops i\'m not well  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**my body my vessel my temple all fallen under this spell**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;they\'ve been heckled by pitchfork and shovel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**now they\'re calling out help**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**i need somebody can\'t seem to leave this party myself**\n\nThe author understands that he is not well, that the mind and body are misaligned, that they have fallen under a spell. Now, he recognizes that he cannot take it longer and calls for escape. He also calls for the help of a guru to escape.\n\n&gt;(Hook)\n\n**Author #2**\n\n&gt;Up late, making it sharp like a razor  \n&gt;  \n&gt;over and over till i woke up the neighbour  \n&gt;  \n&gt;from pm to am  \n&gt;  \n&gt;like whats with the racket  \n&gt;  \n&gt;all night feeding that big bad habit\n\nThe author is not exactly clear about what his habit is to my understanding, but this is a continuation of the theme of this song. As you guys know, our Aatmas must often go through "lifetimes" of ailments and trouble before it starts to turn towards Brahman, to escape. The author in this lyric describes himself as consumed by his "big bad habit", it doesn\'t exactly matter what it is in this context, only that it is leading him away from Brahman as it is a physical pleasure. For some, like myself, it might be smoking cannabis a bit too much, more than I know I need to for self-growth. For others, it may be something more serious, such as self-harm. If anyone thinks they know what he means by "making it sharp like a razor", do let me know, I have been trying to ponder upon it as I believe it clues us to his "habit"\n\n&gt;bigger than green Lou Farigno  \n&gt;  \n&gt;no scale big enough seen like he clean blew the ricto\n\nHe expands on how bad this habit is, the fact that it is so bad that it is beyond the Richter scale, a scale used for measuring the quantitative power of an Earthquake. This further hints towards the fact this habit is leading him astray from Brahman.\n\n&gt;rictor, got a resident specter  \n&gt;  \n&gt;ghost living in him like a permanent ficture\n\nHe touches on the cause of this habit, which he essentially describes as a ghost, or specter, living within him. This is similar to the first author, who described it as a devil in his bones; it doesn\'t matter what you call it. It is that which binds us to the physical that leads us astray.\n\n&gt;and now not a sound but the playback  \n&gt;  \n&gt;looptrack running since the days of the adat  \n&gt;  \n&gt;that would probably make a sane man loopy\n\nHe has been faced with the same consequences to his actions, and understand that this is a reoccurring cycle, and it\'s driving him mad. It\'s been happening for quite some time (adat are those cassette tapes from the early 90s).\n\n&gt;mid air hope that I land on two feet  \n&gt;  \n&gt;i\'m on fire this year  \n&gt;  \n&gt;everybody gets fired this year  \n&gt;  \n&gt;work until my irises blear  \n&gt;  \n&gt;i\'m falling apart like a virus in here\n\nThe author is freefalling, and he hopes that he is able to stabilize himself and regain his orientation, getting back on the path of self-realization &amp; introspection. He is working this body so hard that it is literally falling apart, as a virus does when it infects a bacterium.\n\n&gt;(Hook)\n\n**Author #3**\n\n&gt;I\'ve got my Phil Spector,\n\nHe\'s saying that he has his ailment too, alluding to author 2, who called it his specter. However, he communicates it by referring to Phil Spector, a famous record producer/musician that was convicted of murder.\n\n&gt;Hands on my magnum  \n&gt;  \n&gt;gun smoke blown out like candle wicks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;rappers hang from banjo strings  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the second this anthem spins  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and i don\'t mean rap talk as in my raps are sick  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and you ain\'t even half of my stanza\'s wit  \n&gt;  \n&gt;no i mean literally banjo strings  \n&gt;  \n&gt;slicing skin over your adam west dash granny smith\n\nHere, the author makes clear that his ailment is depression/suicidal tendencies, and that it\'s not just him. He clarifies, making it absolutely clear that he\'s not trying to say make some sort of analogy to say how other rappers are inferior, no, he\'s literally talking about people committing suicide.\n\n&gt;sicker this year  \n&gt;  \n&gt;digable planets: slicker this year  \n&gt;  \n&gt;with a pick in my hair  \n&gt;  \n&gt;combing my white boy kid rock box cut  \n&gt;  \n&gt;tick tock stop not  \n&gt;  \n&gt;first name: greatest  \n&gt;  \n&gt;middle name: question mark  \n&gt;  \n&gt;surname: who cares  \n&gt;  \n&gt;insecure tank tops abracadabra  \n&gt;  \n&gt;nothing but a rabbit out a hat top  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Hook)\n\nThank you for reading &lt;3'<br />Author: 'DharmicNotHindu'  id: 'ey3nfx'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ey3nfx/dharmic_translationcommentary_translating_hip_hip/</li>

In nearly every country, vegans are strongly correlated with a liberal and left-leaning philosophy (not that there aren't right-wing vegans, but they're visibly in the minority). However, in India, left-leaning people, especially the younger generation, is keen on proving their liberalism by eating beef as a display of anti-establishment. This makes absolutely no sense; while the left doesn't have a monopoly on compassion, it it certainly strongly associated with it.\n\nBy the way, since this is a right leaning subreddit, if you're vegetarian, I'd also like to implore you to stop consuming dairy products.

      <li>Title::: "India's population myth and truth"<br />Body: "A lot of people are misinformed about the state of India's population and it's future growth. This can be dangerous if all of these misinformation gets politicized. \n\n**Myth: India's population growth is high** \\- Not true at all, in fact it is similar to developed countries like Ireland, Australia and Singapore. There are 2 ways a country's population can grow; first is when its birth rate is higher than its death rate and second is when immigration into the country is higher than emigration. India's fertility rate is very close to replacement fertility of 2 (meaning the 2 kids replace their 2 parents) and net migration is so small and insignificant. \n\nThe reason why India's population is still expected to grow to 1.6-1.7 billion is because of something called **the great fill up**. People have a hard time understanding this trend. If 100 Gen X people give birth to 4 Gen Y each, who then give birth to 1 Gen Z each, we have a population of 100X-400Y-400Z. Notice that Gen Z population is 4 times more than Gen X, despite the birth rate dropping by 4 times in a generation. If Gen X dies and Gen Z give birth to 1 Gen A each, the tally is now 400Y-400Z-400A; the total population increased by 300 people in a generation.\n\nAnother example, Japan's fertility rate dropped to below 2 in the 1970s, but its population continued to grow and peaked in 2015. India will also experience this; if the fertility rate reaches replacement in 2024, then the population may peak in 2064. **No matter how low India's birth rate gets, this population growth is inevitable.**  In fact it's dangerous to force very low births because then at some point of time, there will be too many elderly people and too few young taxpayers to support them. **The best outcome is for India's fertility rate to reduce slowly and gradually.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ewzmvu'<br />Score:37<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ewzmvu/indias_population_myth_and_truth/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Indian Army's hospitals for Wuhan evacuees are not enough"<br />Body: "I have seen a lot of coverage of the the 600 bed hospital built by ITBP for people being evacuated from Wuhan, and I thought I would share why this is not enough.\n\n[A picture of said hospital](https://preview.redd.it/ztghf2jbx5e41.jpg?width=615&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a640a2ac39956a7787b6601bf51e960f2366ef9a)\n\nSome people have pointed out that keeping people in the same room like the one above could spread the infection. The response to this is usually that everyone will be tested and those who are unwell will be isolated in separate single rooms while those who are well will be monitored in communal spaces such as the one above for 14 days. This seems to make sense but there are major flaws with this plan.\n\nTesting for the virus takes at least 24 hours because it is a PCR test and only two virology labs in India one in Delhi and another in Pune have the facility to sequence the RNA and confirm that it is indeed 2019-nCoV. This is the entire reason why the healthcare system in Wuhan is so troubled right now. They cannot test people fast enough. So, once these Indian citizens have been brought back from Wuhan, there will be a period of at least 24 hours when nobody will know who is infected and who is not. What happens during that time? If someone is showing symptoms of the disease, such as fever or cough, you can assume that they are infected and proactively quarantine them in an individual room, away from all others. But if this were enough, Wuhan would not be in the state that it is today.\n\nIt is well established that you can have the virus and even spread it to others **without** showing any symptoms yourself. So, while we are waiting for the test results, the only proper way to handle the evacuees is to assume that **everyone** is sick and they ALL need to be isolated from each other, which means communal spaces like the one above are a complete no no. After evacuating these people, in the first 24 hours, if we keep all asymptomatic people (who are not showing any signs of the disease) in the same room, we will later find out that one of them was in fact infected and he then infected many of the others who were not infected initially. These infections will occur in India because of living in the same room. They will not be picked up by the blood test because the subjects will have already given their blood samples before being moved into this facility when they were not infected. \n\nWhat if we put walls between the beds and isolate people? We all promise to wear masks all the time. Is it enough?\n\nIt is still not enough. The facility where people are isolated should have a 'negative pressure' i.e. lower  than atmospheric pressure which means that air can come into the room but it cannot go outside. An air filtration system is used to clean the air in the room and remove all pathogens from it before it is sent back outside. This is the protocol used in, for example, UK, US and, of course, China.\n\nWhat China is doing in building their much talked about 1000 bed pre fab hospital is exactly this. Every bed in their 1000 bed hospital will be completely isolated from the remaining 999 beds. This is the whole reason why they need to make a new hospital in the first place! If not for this negative pressure requirement, they could have simply converted hotel rooms into hospitals, not unlike the above picture. They haven't done so because it does not really isolate people.\n\nI firmly believe that our soldiers will do their very best in ensuring the safety of these citizens and the medical staff, but they have not been properly informed on the scientific protocol for isolating patients. I believe the scientific community has either not been made part of the decision making process or ITBP have withheld information as to why their plan would work. I don't think the room in the picture above has negative pressure and having NP for the whole room would not work anyways.\n\nAppendix: Someone smart might dig up international news and point out that Japan has also not quarantined its citizens. Are they foolish? The answer lies in the country's laws. As per Japanese law, they cannot force people to isolate themselves. They cannot even force them to take a test for the corona virus! In fact, two of their citizens who were evacuated from Wuhan have refused to take the blood test at all. It is such a big issue that  Japanese PM Mr. Abe has publicly said that he regrets that these two have decided not to take the test, thereby putting the people near them in danger."<br />Author: 'iamjaiyam'  id: 'ewtswt'<br />Score:46<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ewtswt/indian_armys_hospitals_for_wuhan_evacuees_are_not/</li>

      <li>Title::: "1979 Marichjhapi Massacre : The forcible eviction of around 40000 Bangladeshi Hindu Dalit refugees from Marichjhapi , the rape and murder of women, children and men carried out by Jyoti Basu's left Govt and its CPM Cadres"<br />Body: 'Marichjhapi Massacre refers to the forcible eviction of around 40000 Bangladeshi Hindu Dalit refugees who occupied legally protected reserve forest land on Marichjhapi island in Sundarban, West Bengal, in 1979, and the subsequent death of thousands due to gunfire by police and politically-aligned goondas, blockade and subsequent starvation, and disease. It is said that the Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans became man-eaters after they feasted on the bodies of the people killed at Marichjhapi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 1978 the refugees started to arrive in Bengal in huge numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***But the Left Front meanwhile changed its policy (after forming government) on refugee settling and considered the refugees as a burden to the state, as the refugees were not the citizen of West Bengal but India***.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn approximately 150,000 almost all of Dandakaranya refugees arrived (where most of them were deported back).\\[4\\] In the meanwhile approximately 40,000 refugees went south and camping for few months in Hasnabad settled in Marichjhapi (renamed by them as "Netaji Nagar"), a protected place under Reserve Forest Act. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Role of the Left Government**\n\nLeft Front meanwhile changed its policy on refugee. The left government considered that an unauthorized occupation of reserved forest land. The government tried to pursue them to return to their respective place, but with little effect. \n\nOn 24 January 1979, the Government of West Bengal clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC around the island of Marichjhapi. The police and the district administration started an economic blockade. Thirty police launches started patrolling the island, preventing anyone from providing food or water to the residents of the island. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**31 January 1979 - Rape and Murderous acts by West Bengal Police and CPM Cadres**\n\nSurvivors claim that on the morning of 31 January 1979, when some women tried to row boats to the next island to fetch drinking water, grains and medicine, the police rammed their launches into the boats and drowned all three. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Some women were allegedly picked up by the policemen on the launches, taken to the nearest police station, gang-raped for days and then released.\n* People who took boats into the river to save the drowning women were fired on by the police.\n* Police continued attacking people who braved the action and took multiple boat trips back and forth to get the necessities. \n* It is claimed that CPM cadres had also landed in Marichjhapi that day, fired at, killed and raped islanders and looted their belongings.\n* 13 people died when someone poisoned a tube well. \n* After many days of continued repression, on 14 June 1979, the police came, set the huts afire and forced the remaining people out of the island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ultimately resulted in a confrontation between refugees armed with crude implements like bows and arrows, lathis, bricks and stones, on one hand, and the police on the other.   After the failure of economic blockade the left government started forcible evacuation in May.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***It has been alleged that under the orders of the left government, the police launches dumped the dead bodies in water, while many others drowned while they were trying to flee.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Court Order and Media Barred**\n\nAfter 15 days Calcutta High Court ruled that "The supply of drinking water, essential food items and medicines as well as the passage of doctors must be allowed to Marichjhapi". The media were barred from entering the area on that day. \n\nThe survivors were then sent back to Dandakaranya. Some of them were settled in Marichjhapi Colony near Barasat while others rehabilitated themselves in the shanties near railway tracks in Sealdah. Some of the survivors resettled themselves in Hingalganj, Canning and nearby areas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMamata Banerjee, before coming to power in 2011, promised a judicial probe into the Marichjhapi massacre but nothing has been done until now. She used the cause during her election rallies showing movies of the Marichjhapi  incident and after coming to power she has literally done nothing to zero about the cause.\n\nJust compare the situation to what is happening to do, to what lengths the hypocrite Left and TMC going about the CAA , do you think they would do the same when the issue is done and dusted a few years down the lane.\n\nThe then Jyoti Basu govt took no initiatives in settling the Bangladeshi Hindus most were dalits who couldn\'t return back unlike the upper class rich Hindus. What\'s important is to understand this particular phrase by the Left govt,\n\n ***But the Left Front meanwhile changed its policy (after forming government) on refugee settling and considered the refugees as a burden to the state, as the refugees were not the citizen of West Bengal but India***.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[*Marichjhapi Incident*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marichjhapi_incident)\n\n[*The Tale of Marichjhapi :Review of the book “Marichjhapi chhinna desh, chhinna itihaash”*](http://www.radicalsocialist.in/articles/socialist-peoples-history/454-the-tale-of-marichjhapi-review-of-the-book-marichjhapi-chhinna-desh-chhinna-itihaash)\n\n[*40 yrs ago, the Left mercilessly massacred Dalit Bengalis.

      <li>Title::: "Does India's poor physical infrastructure give it a bad reputation in the world stage?"<br />Body: "Recently I was reading the comments of a video on the Coronavirus outbreak; about how it has reached India and Philippines. Non-Indians were quick to point out that because India has poor living conditions and is densely populated, the virus is gonna go on a rampage in the country. However, if you look at the reality, none of those prophecies seem to be happening. Indian health officials are doing all the right steps in identifying, isolating and treating those who may be infected.\n\n**So why is there a disconnect between perception and reality?** In my opinion, the reason is because India has poor hard infrastructure, but reasonably good soft infrastructure. Foreigners assume that India is a 3rd world sh\\*thole, because what they see is old and crumbling public buildings that are few and far in between. What they don't realize is, the public servants who work in these buildings are reasonably good at what they do. \n\nThis is the total opposite of East Asian countries like China, which has magnificent hard infrastructure but the human capital and institutions are not up to the same standard. But foreigners won't realize this until they live there for a lengthy period of time. What they see from the outside is a Shanghai that's looks as developed as a New York  or a Wuhan that appears almost as clean and hygienic as any Japanese city. That's the benefit of having impressive hard infrastructure, **the country appears a lot more developed than it actually is**. \n\nI think India needs to have an East Asian mindset when it comes to hard infrastructure. The construction sector should be deregulated and privatized and activists who stall projects need to be given harsh jail sentences. Land reform is also badly needed. **Feel free to comment on what you think about this.**"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'ewm3g7'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ewm3g7/does_indias_poor_physical_infrastructure_give_it/</li>

      <li>Title::: "My recent experiences have finally made me realise (and appreciate our ancestors' farsightedness!) the reasons behind Hinduism's survival despite all the invasions, and why it will continue to do so in the near future."<br />Body: 'The Student Activity Centre of MNNIT (like every year) organised the recently concluded Saraswati Puja with much gusto. The institute, like most institutes of Prayagraj, is a haven for RW ideologues. MNNIT tradition has the UG/PG final year seniors organising all such festivals, and then passing on the baton to the 3rd years. \n\nSo this year, when we asked which 3rd year students would be interested in organising all the Hindu festivals next year, we had a couple of agnostics approach us for doing so. Intrigued, we asked why they were interested in organising a religious affair. One of them replied that while he was skeptical about the existence of God, he liked how Hindu festivals were more "fun" compared to others, having lots of songs and colours. Although we didn\'t end up choosing them, the guy\'s reply got me thinking.\n\nA ton of people, even in the humongous crowd that had gathered today, weren\'t really what one would call "believers". Yet, *all of them* were extremelyy enthusiastic about the Aarti, the Murti Pujan and the subsequent Prasad distribution. \n\nEven Adi Shankaracharya was a non-theist, in the sense that he believed in Nirgun/impersonal Brahman. And yet, he was the one who had established मठ in all the 4 directions, and established the pontiff/Guru Parampara system which saved Sanatan Dharma from the brink of extinction when Buddhism was being almost aggressively pushed.\n\nAnd this is exactly why I believe Hinduism will survive even if other religions will die out. The acharyas who had written the Puranas had so cleverly placed the festivals throughout the year, with appropriate gaps between them, that even people who aren\'t "temple goers" would remember to gather at such times, if only for the "fun", and inevitably end up remembering and revering our deities.\n\nThe difference between Allah/Yahweh and our deities is that while the former are omnipotent megalomaniacal beings, our deities are also cultural heroes. They have a supernatural aspect, but they are also so *humanlike* and so *relatable* that it\'s extremely difficult not to fall in love with them. \n\nAnd ironically, it is this humanlike quality of theirs which will keep them "alive" even when those "all powerful, all knowing" beings would be long forgotten.'<br />Author: 'TerryMcGinnis1999'  id: 'evztfm'<br />Score:43<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/evztfm/my_recent_experiences_have_finally_made_me/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Some Questions to Leftists on here (Part -1)'<br />Body: 'So leftists mostly show that they are riding the high horse when it comes to morality. For them the reality is black or white. Good or Bad. That leftists are good and others are bad. My question is how are the people you call bad, bad? Like are they doing something harmful towards the society? Or just because they dont follow your line of thought they are bad? Sometimes leftists are like, "heh, he doesnt speak English" or "eh bad grammar, not worth my time ". Is that what makes them bad?\nIf leftists think they are morally superior to others, is it justified? \n\n\nWhen it comes to equality, leftists claim that all should be equal. Equal in what?\nGetting opportunities to prosper? We have the system in place. RTE, Reservations etc etc. In todays time males and females have equal opportunities to prosper. \nEquality before law? Already in constitution, so doesnt matter if you are Rightwing or leftwing, its gonna be followed anyway.\nAnd to be honest not everybody is born equal, there are social, economical, geographical, cultural, religious, environmental differences. The ways people are raised are always different. Then what kinda equality are you talking about? LGBT has been legalized in India.\n\n\nAnother thing that baffles me about liberals is that they call people "Uneducated" sometimes. "Politicians without education shouldnt be running country" or so they say. I am like are you dumb or what? They are politicians they are well versed in politics. And Politics is all about influencing people and gaining power and rising high. Come on, like do you seriously think that a science degree or law degree or engineering degree (or any degree except political science) will help in gaining power and influencing people. I have a degree in Engineering, and it never taught me how to win elections or how to influence people or stay in power. Pretty sure it goes the same for you. If you consider yourself to be educated, I can bet that you wont be able to influence your family to change their mind, (all those frustrated people stories who try changing opinions of their close ones on the sister subreddit). Let alone your buildng, let alone your colony and let alone your town/city. State and Nation seems a far away dream, lol. Politicians never aspired to be scientists or engineers or doctors (though I agree it gives an edge, but its not a neccesity). If there is a politician in power you must understand that he has more than enough political education to be in the place that he/she is (doesnt matter if its formal or informal). So do you really think that technical education (though i agree it gives an edge, but not every educated person aspires to be in power or knows how to be in power) is essential for holding a political post?\n\nSecularism is an issue which leftists think they own. In Indian context, Hinduism is as secular and tolerant as it can get. One can be Rightwing Hindu and Secular at the same time in India. Pretty sure lot of people on this subreddit would agree. There is no proselytizing in Hinduism. No blasphemy. An Atheist can be a Hindu. And many other schools are present . No other religion comes close to Hinduism in terms of secularism. And caste system (though lot of people follow it, it became as rigid as it is during British times) and before British times it wasnt even rigid. I read in a Shashi Tharoor book (An Era of Darkness) that a person could change his caste by changing his profession and village/town/city. So if the caste system became rigid it can be blamed upon the British. Though caste is not related to secularism, can you tell me other religions than Hinduism which are tolerant towards other religions in their basic tenets?\n\n\nThis is it for Part 1, if this thread churns out some interesting discussions, I have more questions which I will post in Part 2.'<br />Author: 'car_bike_sutta'  id: 'ev9ixs'<br />Score:30<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ev9ixs/some_questions_to_leftists_on_here_part_1/</li>

These emotions are directly associated with the development of the country. \n\nNo one can stop a country if its youth has all these emotions. 65% of Indians are below 35 years of age, making India a young country. It is important that India's thought is young as well. \n\nIndia's youth is getting restless with no change. It wants change, that hasn't happened in 70 years since Independence. It is not ready to fall prey to these old problems:\n\nIt wants to change the country and the situation. It has decided that problems won't be postponed; they would be faced and solved\n\nEarlier, what was done for solving problems in Kashmir? 3-4 families worked not towards solving the issues but towards nurturing them. The result was that thousands of innocents died due to terrorism. People were forced to migrate:\n\nIf any disease continues for a long time, it becomes a part of the body. In our social life, this has happened. Several diseases had weakened our country in a way that most of its energy was being utilized to fight these problems:\n\nArticle 370 was implemented in J&amp;K as temporary arrangement. It continued for decades as no one showed enough courage to abrogate it. For vested interests and vote-banks, politicians did not solve this issue for 70 years\n\n\nCould we hand our youth a country that had a problem of terrorism? Absolutely not. Kashmir is our pride and freeing it from problems was our responsibility and we delivered:\n\nYou know the behavior bestowed upon the North-East states in the past. For decades, the needs and aspirations of the people from the region were ignored\n\nNot just the people, but the problems were ignored as well. Several organizations that were born there did not believe in democracy &amp; killed thousands of people. Could we leave the North-East like that?:\n\nWe know that our neighbouring country has lost 3 wars against us, our armed forces don't need more than 10-12 days to defeat them. They've been fighting proxy wars against India since decades. It claimed the lives of thousands of civilians,jawans\n\nIn the last 30 years, not one next-generation fighter was added to our Air Forces. Our pilots martyred, there were accidents\n\nWe started the work that was stopped for 3 decades. We're happy to have Rafale, the next-gen fighter plane, and it has been inducted in the IAF\n\nOur jawans were asking for bullet-proof jackets since 2009, but the former Govt did not care about it. His life is more valuable than people like us: PM Narendra Modi\n\nOur Govt not only bought the bullet-proof jackets for our jawans, but we're also moving ahead to export bullet-proof jackets\n\nOur Govt not only bought the bullet-proof jackets for our jawans, but we're also moving ahead to export bullet-proof jackets\n\nThis was the same emotion behind the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. It was India's responsibility to protect these people who were continuously persecuted on religious grounds: PM Narendra Modi\n\nNow that our Govt has brought the Citizenship Amendment Act, some political parties are holding on to their vote-banks. Why can't they see such persecution in Pakistan?\n\nThey need to answer these questions. Some of them are trying to become the voice of Dalits. These are the same people who can't see the persecution on Dalits in Pakistan:\n\nThey need to understand that the refugees that have come in, most of them, are Dalits: \n\nSome time ago, Pakistan's Army had put out an advertisement. It was an ad for cleaning workers. It said that only non-Muslims could apply for the post. That means it was for these Dalits and other minorities\n\nPeople who are protesting against the CAA, are the same that protested against the Enemy Property Act as well\n\nAfter Partition, India and Bangladesh have shared some issues about the border as well. No major steps were taken to solve this issue\n\nFor vested interests, these problems were allowed to linger. This was going on in India. It is our Govt that solved the border issue with Bangladesh:\n\nBoth India and Bangladesh are standing together after solving this issue. We are fighting poverty together\n\nDuring partition, a line was drawn on a piece of paper. This line had pushed the Kartarpur Gurudwara into Pakistan:\n\nWhy was it left that way? When our Army had captured 90 thousand Pak soldiers, India could have kept its terms. Why did it not use that opportunity? \n\nThe country is silent, surely, but is understanding it in detail. The people know how lies were spread for vote-bank politics for decades. \n\nSource: https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1222047474933587968"<br />Author: 'brackenlassie'  id: 'ev4nhc'<br />Score:105<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ev4nhc/salient_lines_of_modis_speech_from_ncc_rally/</li>

Drona then tells that only who has observed vows of Brahmin(compassion, truth, austerities) and qualities of kshtriya(protecting weaker people and honor) can use such weapons. People take this criteria as related to caste but what he meant was qualities. Karna then left him and went to Parshurama.\nProof of this relationship is in MB Adi Parva, Vana parva where Karna states Drona as his mentor with Parshurama and Shanti Parva too.\n\nSome people believe Manu Smriti is casteist\n\nNowhere in Manu Smriti it's mentioned that only you will be bharaman if you born in a bharaman family\nIn manu smriti Steps are given to goverment so they can manage civilisations not restrict anyone to change quality\n\nAlso Manu Smriti even allow interquality marriages\nBharaman can even marry shudra according to manu smriti\n\n\nAlso The original Manu Smriti which is lost contains which contains 1lakh verses\nWhich was reduced to 8k and now only 4k verses are available\nSo current version is not even summary of original.\n\nNow some people claim that if it's not part of Hinduism then why people do that?\n\nAnswer) Because people are corrupted after 1000 years of Islamic rule and casteism does exist in Islam\n\nCasteism started in India after 1000AD\n\nIts just a social problem and can very easily be resolved just if you give clearity to people that Our sacred text say somthing else.\nI did it with my whole friend section my family my relatives\n\nIf any of you disagree with me Comment section is open ask anything i will answer\n\n\nReplying to some idiots who belive its Hinduism philosophy\nPlease upvote my comment here and downvote the thread\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/EXHINDU/comments/eturpb/discrimination_on_the_basis_of_caste/"<br />Author: 'fringehindu'  id: 'ev1i59'<br />Score:22<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ev1i59/casteism_in_hinduism_important/</li>

A simple understanding of a cell. I read it in school and I hope you all will recall it. A cell has two DNA.. One in nucleus and other in mitochondria. Usually nucleas DNA is responsible for all kinds of genetic character and mitochondrial DNA does not takes much part in any kind of protein synthesis or gives any character. I am not an expert but it is not entirely wrong. mtDNA is being carried from generations after generations and it is used to study evolution.\n\nSo during fusion male chromosomes and female chromosomes fuse in nucleus and determine sex, and other characteristics while mtDNA is simply carried from female to progeny. \n\nStudies reveal that Indian Muslims both shia and sunni have much more similarity with other Indians than western Muslims. Also their mtDNA is very much similiar showing maternal lineage to be Indian...!!!\n\nA similarity of mtDNA also shows that mothers were Indian (Hindus) while male chromosome may or may not be... 😐\n\nAnother point, has this issue been settled or not? If not why haven't we settled this issue in court yet.\n\nOther issues like alexander invasion theory, aryan invasion, Dravidian lineage is separate. Why haven't these issues been solved in court. It is important because they lee glorifying ghaznavi, ghori, aurangzeb, taimur.. It will break all of this. \n\nAny thoughts on this matter.

      <li>Title::: 'Veer Savarkar Memorial, The Hidden Gem'<br />Body: "[Veer Savarkar sitting on his throne in Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak](https://i.imgur.com/9NNgO9g.jpg).\n\nMany living in Mumbai know about Shivaji Park. Many in India might have heard about it too. Shivaji Park is one of the iconic places of Mumbai situated in Mahim / Matunga / Dadar area of the central-southern part of the city.\n\nIts a ground where some of the greatest cricketers in the world have grown up on. Ajit Wadekar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri, Sachin Tendulkar to I am sure even new generation cricketers like Rohit Sharma and even Prithvi Shaw, all might have played atleast once in this ground, if not grown up on it.\n\nShivaji Park is also a ground famously known for it's Dusshera celebrations. Every year a big sized Ravan is effigy is destroyed here. The ground also holds huge importance to many major politicians in the country.\n\nOn one of the most important parts of the ground, almost as if guarding the ground is an underrated mandir of completely silver lord Ganesh. While Siddhivinayak Mandir of lord Ganesh is one of the most iconic temples, the Ganpati temple of Shivaji Park, while not famous, is not behind when it comes to importance. It can be fairly said that all those great legends who have had chance to visit the ground has the blessings of Ganpati Bappa of Shivaji Park ground.\n\nRight opposite the temple stands a huge statue of a man who dedicated a huge part of his life to the freedom movement of India. The place dedicated to Veer Savarkar.\n\nYears ago, when I was a small child, one of my fondest memory of walking through Veer Savarkar Marg, a road named Cadel Road then, was to see this great man's statue.\n\nSitting in umbrella in one hand, pointing towards the sky with another. Sat on the what I remember on the tallest part of the area, in between green trees. Unknown to me who that person was. I was told the statue was of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Veer Savarkar.\n\nEvery time I used to go through there, I used to remember seeing the statue of a great son of India. It was as I mentioned, one of my fondest memories. Years went by, I could not go there again as we had long shifted out of the place. Some years later, I had the chance to visit the same place to see the statue and what do I find. I find the greenery near Veer Savarkar's statue was situated is not visible there. Nor can I find the Veer Savarkar statue. It was a quick visit in night. But I was saddened that I couldn't find it.\n\nFor years and years I wondered. Where is Veer Savarkar statue that I liked. I haven't visited Shivaji Park in years and years. I don't know what happened to it.\n\nCouple of days ago. While republic day discussions were happening, I suddenly remembered the statue of Veer Savarkar of my childhood. But I didn't remember anything else. What was the statue's name or place. After a lot of searching, I found that, to my delight, Veer Savarkar statue has not gone anywhere, it's there itself. Standing behind him is the even bigger photo of what I guess is Bharat Mata blessing him.\n\nThe place has been renovated completely and its named Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak, a memorial for Veer Savarkar. Not only that, the memorial also has an online site dedicated to it, I request everyone to go through their [about page describing the memorial](https://www.savarkarsmarak.com/aboutsmarak.php).\n\nMaybe I was mistaken, maybe there was no greenery in the area. I was too small to remember. Maybe the statue was there along but I couldn't find it. Or maybe the memorial was up for renovation when I went there. I don't know, maybe someone else can tell me the full story. But I do remember that I tried a lot to find the statue I loved in my childhood and I have finally found it. This time I know there is a museum dedicated to him and this time I know, who this great man, sitting the the chair with umbrella is.\n\nI am attaching some of the images of the great statue of Veer Savarkar I have collected from Google Maps, with the photos belonging to their rightful owners, who's names are mentioned below the photos themselves. The first photo is from [this article](https://www.freepressjournal.in/amp/story/cmcm%2Fphotos-bjp-president-amit-shah-pays-tribute-to-shivaji-veer-savarkar-in-mumbai).\n\nThe photos of the statue of the great man:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NCZZtyt.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NUrHfaY.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ozRB8aD.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/e0DIYg9.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b9yy8cf.jpg\n\nSo next time, when you come to Mumbai. Always remember to visit one, Shivaji Park, the Ganpati temple in it and not to forget, go and see the statue and the memorial dedicated to the great man, Veer Savarkar."<br />Author: 'Mumbaikarsevak'  id: 'euo135'<br />Score:24<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/euo135/veer_savarkar_memorial_the_hidden_gem/</li>
      <li>Title::: "Why I don't support CAA"<br />Body: 'I know you guys are going to hate on me for this, but here are my top reasons for not supporting CAA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Government has no f\\*\\*king business getting involved in religion: Governments are meant to work for people not religions. The government is here to work for people without discrimination, but getting involved with religion you are already showing that you are biased and you want to see the other religion burn (It is just islam today, tomorrow some other leader will say Sikhs are not allowed, then someone will say Jains are not allowed). No country, that has put religion as it\'s priority has ever succeeded (eg. Pakistan). Now CAA is supposed to work for the religiously persecuted in P,A,B, but in-case you did not know they can already apply for citizenship with India stating religious persecution (1000s of Hindus, Sikhs come to India from Pakistan every year in the same process). The CAA is just another process of getting citizenship, it is not as if they never got Indian citizenship. Also, in-case you did not know Muslims from Pakistan can still apply for Indian citizenship. So all I can say that CAA is just a Jhumla to make racists happy. In reality, they have changed nothing.\n2. Waste of time and resources: As stated above, this literally changes nothing. Those who wanted to come to India always came back. There was no restriction. So now we are going to wasted all of our energy debating and protesting a law. This government is so incompetent at economics, that it can even perform as good as a corrupt government like congress which when through 2008 financial crisis and the highest oil prices. But, now thanks to modi-ji we will waste one more year fighting and showing musalmans their aukat. It\'s like beating your 10 year old brother and flexing about it in the wrestling match. We can instead have spent all of this time in creating new jobs and strengthening the economy. \n3. Army: BJP is walking on the dead bodies on thousands of Hindu and muslim soldiers who gave their lives protecting this motherland without thinking about what religion they are protecting. They were protecting India and indians, not hindus/sikhs/jains/muslims. Just like army is meant to protect our nation, government is meant to handle our nation, not our religions. \n4. NRC: NRC is Assam is totally acceptable and I support it. But, Shah made it clear that they will implement it in all of India. Now why is this a problem? The answer is because this means now everyone in India will be first considered a foreigner and then they have to prove their citizenship using documents. The poverty rate in India have been over 50% for the majority, many people do not have documents or they actually never owned property in India. If you think there are no such people, be happy you so privileged to be on reddit. A lot of people cannot even afford a small nokia phone. Now, BJP can start this process and Hire a private company to do the process, which can easily be a bunch of RSS goons like the IT cell or Opindia that will look at any case and see a Muslim name and declare that you are not a true citizen. But wait, what are the rules? No one knows because it is "assessment of your documents". Your aadhar is invalid, Drivbing license is invalid, Voter id is invalid (Amit shah confirmed all of this, you can look up videos). Now what is supposed to be "assessment of your documents" is just a bunch of dudes who want see India\'s diversity die. \n\n  \nNow, Why do i fear this will affect me a 100% Hindu in India. Because, I\'m not Hindu first. I\'m an Indian first, Telugu next, Hyderabadi next, and then a Hindu. Before you tell how Hindu khatre main hain, make me believe India tmahre wajhese, khatre mein nahi hain. Today, you are going after their religion, tomorrow you might come after my language and my culture.  \n\n\nSo, I do not support CAA.

      <li>Title::: 'My case for Kejriwal and AAP'<br />Body: 'My Case for Kejriwal\n\nYep, you read that right, it is not clickbait either, so read on.\n\nDisclaimer - From the start I have been attracted by the AAP adventure, I even signed up after that stunning win they had in Delhi (the first time) and donated a lot of cash. Then started Kejriwal\'s endless nautanki and within months I turned into a detractor. Esp given my personal investment of time and money, the animosity I had towards him was outdone only by the animosity I hold towards the Fake Gandhis - Indira and down (that is pretty legendary though).\n\nHowever AK seems very shrewd as a tactician, and unlike the hardcore demagogues we have like a Momta or any of the Southern party chiefs, open to substantial course correction. While he did overdo the whole "Anarchist" nonsense, he and his party seem to have settled down into actually doing issue based voting (in parliament) and not just personality, hate driven. So while many of these regional satraps opposed removal of Art 370, AAP supported it. On CAA, AK has pretty much maintained radio silence, sat out Shaheen Bhag entirely (the AAP and AK of even a half a year ago would have gone balls to the walls in this same scenario), and only recently said that everyone has a right to protest which is vague at best.\n\nAAP seems to now decided working with centre is the way forward and gone are the protests about the LG and the threats to initiate statehood for Delhi. Broadly speaking, AK has his own vote bank but is also broadly willing to look at the bigger picture.\n\nAs to WHY Kejriwal / AAP - Fact is, we need a solid alternative to the various regional satraps and of course the Congress. AAP definitely has the right intentions of increasing funding for education and healthcare (yes, a lot of it is just propaganda but you can\'t expect him to fix Delhi\'s health and education systems in 5 years just as you can\'t expect Modi to fix it at a national level in 5 - if you support one and not the other on this, you are a hypocrite). They seem to put national interests ahead of parochial ones (unless even this current behaviour is false in which case...well, back to Kejriwal hating for me). Is this perfect? No but compared to the alternatives in Delhi and Punjab (for a start), at least a semblance of a vision is being articulated!\n\nI do want AK / AAP to win Delhi and possibly Punjab in the near to mid future (even 10 seats in Punjab would be a good start), AK to continue to not be a nautanki driven clown and also get their MLA\'s / MP\'s to go  back to the people which was the origins of this project.\n\nAll this should help accelerate the diminishing of the Congressi votebank which as long as the fake Gandhis head, is pure cancer.'<br />Author: 'RajaRajaC'  id: 'eumu5h'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eumu5h/my_case_for_kejriwal_and_aap/</li>

Here, we discuss all the happenings from around the world. The discussion does not have to be related to India. Here are some stories to get the conversation started:\n\n# Top 3 stories from India's neighbourhood\n\n1. [Imran Khan at Davos compares India to Nazi Germany](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/pakistani-premier-compares-india-to-nazi-germany-while-at-davos-1.8436003)\n\nSpeaking at he 50th summit of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Pakistani PM Imran Khan once again tried to draw parallels between India and Nazi Germany. Pakistan has been a regular visitor to the annual rich man's club at Davos, and Imran Khan has been visiting since before he became PM. At Davos, he also met US President Donald Trump, who reiterated that he would mediate between India and Pakistan if asked to by both sides. \n\n2. [Myanmar rejects ICJ ruling on Rohingyas](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51229796)\n\nThe International Court of Justice, ruling in a case brought against Myanmar by the African Muslim-majority state of Gambia, described the violence in the Rakhine state as a genocide against the Rohingya Muslims and ordered the country to take steps to end the crisis and bring the Rohingyas home. The order is binding and not subject to appeal, but there is no enforcement mechanism unless it goes to the Security Council. Myanmar has rejected the ruling and said that it will use its own internal processes to tackle the violence. \n\n3. [Severe air pollution in Bangkok leads to protests](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-strike-thailand/thai-protesters-demand-action-as-air-pollution-clouds-bangkok-idUSKBN1ZM1EM)\n\nAir pollution soared in Thailand's capital of Bangkok, leading to widespread closure of schools and businesses as people dawned masks to protect themselves. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reached a dangerous peak of 161 before climbing down slightly. Protesters marched against the military-backed government after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told at-risk people to 'manage' the risks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Top 3 stories from the rest of the world\n\n1. [Trump impeachment trial begins](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51184421)\n\nAfter the US House of Representatives passed articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump - essentially a chargesheet - and made him only the third President in the US' 300+ year history to have been charged such, action shifted to the trial in the Senate, where the US Chief Justice will preside and 100 Senators will act as a jury. Final impeachment requires a 2/3 majority, but Trump's Republican Party that has a majority has made it clear that he will not be impeached. The prosecution team from House Democrats concluded their case, and the defense now begins. \n\n2. [Brexit agreement signed, much work still ahead](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51244126)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson finally signed the agreement that will pull the UK out of the European Union on January 31 in a historic ceremony in 10 Downing Street. The agreement now puts the UK in a transitional period, when EU rules will still apply to it. That period will last to the end of the year, by when the UK hopes to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU. Meanwhile, the US has also indicated that it working on an FTA with the UK. \n\n3. [Welcome to the Year of the Rat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/01/24/chinese-new-year-questions-answered/4552531002/)\n\nOver a billion Chinese citizens and hundreds of millions of ethnic Chinese around the world begin celebrating the Lunar New Year - the first new moon of the year and the beginning of a new 12-year cycle. Each year is traditionally represented by an animal, and this year's animal is the rat. According to Chinese lore, the rat represents speed and cleverness. The festival is the most important  event in Chinese culture. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Geopolitical History: Black Death\n\nThere is much panic and fear (some justified, some hype) about the spread of Coronavirus in China and beyond. The disease, so far, has a fatality rate of 3%. However, deadly disease has been a part of history, causing massive upheavals and changing destinies. A widespread outbreak of disease that spreads over several geographical areas is known as a pandemic, and perhaps the most deadly pandemic in history was the Black Death in Asia and Europe. It was a form of plague caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, which is commonly carried by fleas in rats. While there is some disagreement on the origin of the disease, it is commonly believed to have originated in Central Asia, in modern day Kyrgyzstan (some historians believe it originated in China). It was called 'black' because the disease would progressively kill parts of the body, causing the skin in that area to turn black. Death happened within 2-10 days of infection, with symptoms being painful and transmission being through  water and food. \n\nIt is believed that the 13th century Mongol conquest of China brought the disease outside of Central Asia through infected soldiers. From there, it spread to India as was reported by European travelers there. Curiously, there is little discussion of a massive plague from Indian sources, possibly due to the fact that that era was a time of great war, as the Delhi Sultanate was expanding throughout the subcontinent at the same time. Nonetheless, it is believed that rats aboard European and Arab trading ships from India and China brought the plague in relatively small amounts to Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBut the turning point was the Mongol invasion of European, specifically Crimea in 1347. The Mongols, who carried the plague from their homeland, were brutal in their tactics. Historians recount that infected soldiers who had died of the plague would be thrown over the walls of fortifications towards the enemy to spread the infection. From Crimea, the plague spread via trade ships and rats to Italy, France, and finally England. The results were fast and horrific. While exact estimates were never kept, it is believed that 75-200 million people died in the matter of a few years (the estimated world population then was approx 0.5 billion people). Europe in particular was ravaged, losing almost *half* its total population. Furthermore, the deaths varied by geography: in warmer climates in southern Europe and the Middle East, the death toll was believed to approach 80% of the population. \n\nAs large parts of the population were wiped out, the spread of the disease slowed as the number of available carriers and those without some natural immunity died. The plague continued to rear its head in fits and stars over the next 500 years, with a particularly strong outbreak in 1855 that killed 10 million people in India alone (the so-called third plague pandemic). In Europe, the plague led to great social changes: a massive shortage of labour challenged the feudal system, with workers demanding greater wages and better living conditions. Anti-Jewish violence spread as Jews were blamed for the plague by the Church (which held a monopoly on healthcare), but eventually, the hold of the Church itself weakened as it was unable to control the plague. Eventually, this weakening of the Church gave way to the Renaissance, bringing Europe into the modern era. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat stories from around the world caught your attention?\n\n*Happy Republic Day!

The enemy who is defeated using this strategy will not be able to forget his enmity. He will lay low till the right time and attack us when least expected. To ensure that doesn’t happen, one should keep a constant eye on such an enemy. One should establish marital relationship {in contemporary world, develop interdependent trade}, and slowly establish mutual cooperation until that enmity is erased.

      <li>Title::: 'Periyar and reforms in Tamilnadu-beyond adulation and anger:'<br />Body: "Subramania Iyer , the co-founder of The Hindu bluntly wrote on caste discrimination and also got his widowed daughter remarried against all social pressure, in 1889.\n\nSubramania Bharathi openly protested against caste, patriarchy and irrationalism much before 1920. His daughter, and daughter of his friend Mandayam Srinivasachar, both young girls, were made to give feminist speeches to women audience.\n\nMuthulakshmi Reddy, well known for social reforms, became a surgeon and had a late-by-then-standard and cross caste marriage before the Justice Party was even formed.\n\nIyothee Dass Pandithar had taken anti-hinduism and anti-brahmin stands on question of social reform in 1890's itself.\n\nGopalkrishna Bharathi used art to argue against caste discrimination, and wrote Nandanar in mid-19th century, which was also quite ahead of its time.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo Periyar was not a pioneer with all these things. But he was, a bit ironically, to social reform( down south) what Mahatma Gandhi was to freedom struggle all over India. Gandhi's ideology had existed in parts much before him, even within India. He contributed by a synthesis and popularisation of those aspects. EVR took the existing ideals to the masses, with increased fervour and excellent organization, much like MKG. Like MKG, his aura was also due to the fact that he seemed to seek nothing for himself out of all this- in fact this was remarked by very Mr.Cho Ramasamy in a magazine's compilation of 100 remarkable Indians! Periyar denied himself political or monetary benefits he could have otherwise obtained. In a sense he seemed to be a sort of honest activist, irrespective of the merits or otherwise of his activism. \n\nHis activism was unquestionably impactful, but it is doubtful if it was successful in the longer run. His anti-hindu stand was directed against Brahmin at the top of the hierarchy but eventually ended up hurting the faith of people across the social pyramid. That the oppressed classes hold religion closer to their heart than even Brahmins, and have always had a psychological and social need for it, has often escaped the brilliant minds of reformers. Periyar was no different. His methods and words only pushed the religious Hindu of different strata to a corner, turning them defensive. In the hindsight, he merely gave a larger intellectual foundation to existing politics of Justice Party and inspired a generation of young activists. His feminist stance was certainly radical, though not unheard of, earlier. But by pushing a section of people to the wall, Periyar inadvertantly caused them to turn deaf ears to his other progressive ideals. \n\nAnd coming back to the MKG analogy, if periyar is vehemently hated by some much like how Gandhi is hated by a section- it is because their followers deified them way too much. They were certainly greater men than most of us but naturally flawed. Like supporters of Mahatma, Periyarists have exaggerated many of his contributions and subdued appreciation of others. Two examples are that of the Vaikom struggle and the Devadasi-system abolition movement. Periyar certainly played a visible role in the former, but along with many others who were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and Narayana Guru. As for the latter, its leader Muthulakshmi Reddy has written that many leaders across political spectrum and social background helped her in passing the Act, except a few who raised obstacles. On both these count, Periyarists have tried to exaggerate his contribution, bordering on hagiography. \n\nAnd such deification and control of popular narrative results in supressed discontent which surface eventually , with equivalent vehemence. This is true for anti-Periyar anger as much as the anti-Gandhi one.\n\nAdd to this, all the arguments against his political ideology, apparent hypocrisy or flip-flops or even personal conduct. Coming back again, these are the very same points on which MKG is debated about, even today. And will need to be debated on, in the future too.\n\nBoth Subramania Bharathi and Periyar are said to have had their life-turning moments in the holy Kasi- though in starkly different ways- which just indicates the subjectivity of their experiences. All these great men were product of their times- often unfinished. \n\nAll these show that Periyar as well as his followers are/were humans, as are others. Between Periyar the messianical panacea for Tamil society and the evil and ignorant nemesis, lies the true periyar we can appreciate, as well as critique with respect!\n\nMinoo Masani, a liberal we have almost forgotten, said that making a religion out of Marxism- the dogmatic adherence and rejection of criticism- was rather a big mistake, say an injustice to Marx himself. This applies to Periyarism as well."<br />Author: 'SOCH-staymoderate'  id: 'ettkxv'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/ettkxv/periyar_and_reforms_in_tamilnadubeyond_adulation/</li>

And they have always think that I am this wholesome and pure kid, which I used to be but am not anymore. They feel I should pray to God and read Bible and be a good Christian; because they believe that is the only way to God, and the only way to be saved from eternal damnation in hell. But as you know I don\'t have faith in Christianity; but that\'s not all, as I have also chosen a life of "sin". I know I can\'t live a happy life by pretending to be someone I am not; but I am afraid of what the alternative would mean for my family. They would be disappointed and I know it will create a rift that will never fill.\n\nBut then I think is it worth it? Should I let down people who have raised me and made the person I am today, especially when they love me so much; just because I want a happy life? Isn\'t that selfish?\n\nI wish I could just move abroad to escape all this. Maybe even start a family there; and while not abandoning (at least not wholly) the family I was born in, I wouldn\'t have to deal with my relatives and society and any judgement which could affect my family. But I am neither rich enough nor intelligent enough to go and start anew in a foreign land. I should have worked harder so that I at least had a shot at leaving this nation. But now I am stuck.\n\nBut is running away the best option? I am not brave or strong but shouldn\'t I try to face those who think I am wrong, when I believe I am not?\n\nMy father wanted me to be an IAS officer; and if I put some effort I can become one. That would be a huge deal because then I would be in a position where I could actually do something. But then I see people who think gays are perverts, degenerates and what not because some gay people do not behave the way they think "normal" people do. Most people still think transgenders mentally ill, and the idea that there can be numerous genders is nothing but a delusion of Western people. And these people are indifferent to the LGBTQ community; they won\'t hurt or kill anyone, but simply maintain their distance. While I have no problem in tolerance without acceptance, I don\'t understand how one can remove misconceptions when people aren\'t interested in listening.\n\nEven if I do become rich or successful or famous, people won\'t listen to me talk about queer stuff because they simply don\'t care. And I will be doing all this at what cost? I would be bringing shame to my family in the eyes of the society. My family members would be embarrassed because of me being proud of the sinful life I lead. And I would have changed virtually nothing in how the society sees people like me.\n\n**Should I think about my family and be a good Christian and marry a girl and settle down and have kids; and sacrifice my happiness for the people I love?**\n\n**Should I be selfish and live my life on own terms, and let down the people who have made me who I am today?**\n\n**Should I try to be the change I want to see in this world, when I know that would change little and would only bring shame to my family - making them a laughing stock?**'<br />Author: 'arxxx69'  id: 'etjipd'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/etjipd/im_a_21_yo_gay_guy_and_i_am_worried_about_my/</li>

Keep in mind that the stats are of 2007  and european countries have absorbed millions of muslim refugees.   \n\n\nAs long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given  country they will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a  threat to anyone. In fact, they may be featured in articles and films,  stereotyped for their colorful uniqueness:\n\nUnited States -- Muslim 1.0%  \n Australia -- Muslim 1.5%  \n Canada -- Muslim 1.9%  \n China -- Muslim 1%-2%  \n Italy -- Muslim 1.5%  \n Norway -- Muslim 1.8%\n\nAt 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities  and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among  street gangs:\n\nDenmark -- Muslim 2%  \n Germany -- Muslim 3.7%  \n United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%  \n Spain -- Muslim 4%  \n Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%\n\nFrom 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population.\n\nThey will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic  standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims.  They will increase pressure on supermarket chai ns to feature it on  their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. ( United  States ).\n\nFrance -- Muslim 8%  \n Philippines -- Muslim 5%  \n Sweden -- Muslim 5%  \n Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3%  \n The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5%  \n Trinidad &amp;Tobago -- Muslim 5.8%\n\nAt this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow  them to rule themselves under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal  of Islam is not to convert the world but to establish Sharia law over  the entire world.\n\nWhen Muslims reach 10% of the population, they will increase  lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions ( Paris  --car-burnings). Any non-Muslim action that offends Islam will result in  uprisings and threats (Amsterdam - Mohammed cartoons).\n\nGuyana -- Muslim 10%  \n India -- Muslim 13.4%  \n Israel -- Muslim 16%  \n Kenya -- Muslim 10%  \n Russia -- Muslim 10-15%\n\nAfter reaching 20% expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia  formations, sporadic killings and church and synagogue burning: Ethiopia  -- Muslim 32.8%\n\nAt 40% you will find widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks and ongoing militia warfare:\n\nBosnia -- Muslim 40%  \n Chad -- Muslim 53.1%  \n Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%\n\nFrom 60% you may expect unfettered persecution of non-believers and  other religions, sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law  as a weapon and Jizya, the tax placed on infidels:\n\nAlbania -- Muslim 70%  \n Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4%  \n Qatar -- Muslim 77.5%  \n Sudan -- Muslim 70%\n\nAfter 80% expect State run ethnic cleansing and genocide:\n\nBangladesh -- Muslim 83%  \n Egypt -- Muslim 90%  \n Gaza -- Muslim 98.7%  \n Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1%  \n Iran -- Muslim 98%  \n Iraq -- Muslim 97%  \n Jordan -- Muslim 92%  \n Morocco -- Muslim 98.7%  \n Pakistan -- Muslim 97%  \n Palestine -- Muslim 99%  \n Syria -- Muslim 90%  \n Tajikistan -- Muslim 90%  \n Turkey -- Muslim 99.8%  \n United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%\n\n100% will usher in the peace of \'Dar-es-Salaam\' -- the Islamic House  of Peace -- there\'s supposed to be peace because everybody is a Muslim:\n\nAfghanistan -- Muslim 100%  \n Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100%  \n Somalia -- Muslim 100%  \n Yemen -- Muslim 99.9%\n\nOf course, that\'s not the case. To satisfy their blood lust, Muslims then start killing each other for a variety of reasons.\n\n\'Before I was nine I had learned the basic canon of Arab life. It was  me against my brother; me and my brother against our father; my family  against my cousins and the clan; the clan against the tribe; and the  tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel." Leon Uris,  \'The Haj\'\n\nIt is good to remember that in many, many countries, such as France,  the Muslim populations are centered around ghettos based on their  ethnicity. Muslims do not integrate into the community at large.  Therefore, they exercise more power than their national average would  indicate.   \n\n\nExamples of Sharia in Europe :   \n1.

      <li>Title::: '[OC] How to get to San Francisco from Mangalore.... In the 16th century!'<br />Body: 'I write novels in my spare time, and I also like reading history. I\'m one of the millions of desis who lives in the Bay area, so the history of my area is also very interesting to me.\n\nI want to write a novel involving an Indian exploring California, much before globalization, and I didn\'t want to write about all the awful native oppression stuff, so it would have to be set before 1769, when the Spanish conquistadors started murdering Native Americans in California. \n\nNow the problem is, how would one get from India to San Francisco back then? It\'s not like we had nonstop Air India flights. \n\nWe know Vasco Da Gama came in 1498. I dug into this, and it turns out after he came and went, there was a lot of trade between the Portuguese and.... The Vijayanagar empire! And this happened right during the rule of Krishnadevaraya! There\'s even descriptions of the kingdom by two Portuguese travellers in 1520 and 1526!\n\nThis was very surprising to me, because I didn\'t know Mangalore was part of the Vijayanagar empire. Not only that, but Krishnadevaraya was also from Tulu Nadu! Not Andhra, as I had previously assumed! \n\nAlso the Portuguese seized control of Mangalore for a short period, and blockaded Arab traders from conducting their business, so the Arabs for angry, and burned down Mangalore in 1695!\n\nLater, in 1762, Hyder Ali kicked out the Portuguese and made it part of the Mysore kingdom. But later, after tipu sultan lost the Anglo-Mysore wars, he had to give Mangalore to the British, and it became part of the British presidency. \n\nOn the other side of the world, the Spanish had captured what is now Mexico and called it "New Spain". They would try to go up to what is now American California, but would always fail! They couldn\'t go by land beyond the Colorado River, and by sea, they would face winds, south-flowing currents, jagged rocks, and fog. Even if they made it, they would have lost half their crew and their ships would need extensive repairs. Given all this, they gave up on California until 1769.\n\nBut there was something else going on. Slave trade. Spanish galleon ships would go between Manila and Acapulco, transporting gold and slaves. These slaves were called Chinos. They were from China, Philippines, Africa, India, and wherever else the Portuguese had a port. There were actually several Indian slaves who made it to Mexico. One of them was named Antonio, and he had been trafficked from Malabar. \n\nThe British also got interested in this area, and they would regularly try and shipwreck the galleon ships off the coast of California. They had made a small base at Point Reyes in the North Bay area, and that area was considered British for a little. \n\nSo there multiple ways an Indian could have made it to San Francisco between 16th and 18th centuries. \n\nI found it really interesting to explore, and what\'s more, most of this information is available for free off the internet! I encourage everyone to explore history that\'s interesting to them, from primary sources. One of the big issues with how history is taught in schools in India is that we have no sense of chronology..... We think ghazni and ghori came right after each other, but no, there was a 150 year gap between them, and Vijayanagar existed and thrived parallely with the mughals, and for a small time, with the marathas. \n\nI\'ve written up what I\'ve said above in more detail on my blog, with sources. Do read it if you find this stuff interesting. https://lila.substack.com/p/california-bhatta-researching-a-novel'<br />Author: 'MyCommentsAreFiction'  id: 'et4nu3'<br />Score:40<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/et4nu3/oc_how_to_get_to_san_francisco_from_mangalore_in/</li>

But will they ever actually try reading people who disagreed with them? Of course not. They have no interest in learning. For them books are just a source of entertainment and self-esteem. They read so they can tell others they read. They say they are atheists but they are actually the biggest and worst kind of theists. Their religion is modernity, of giving up everything old and valuable, worshipping fame, blind followers of materialism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you ever asked a liberal if they like Philosophy?

Why should India be a lightbearer of humanitarian values?\n\nMy questions are the following :-\n\n1. Where is the money going to come from for these schemes. And given that we're not that rich of a country, why should the resources be dedicated to solve that problem?\n2. Why should the government be responsible for solving this problem? All governments are inefficient as fuck. Why is this not being given to private sector with fair markets? Anything the government has monopoly in, it has no reason to improve.\n3. Isn't the first duty of the government to make sure that no harm is caused to a legitimate citizen of the country first? How many people feel comfortable going to the cops and getting justice? Police system is terribly incompetent, why isn't that being fixed? People say that Home ministry is doing things separately so we can solve both economy and the immigration problem at the same time. Then why not solve economics and police reform?\n4. What's up with all these mindless allegations of being anti-hindu? I'm not anti-hindu and neither am I anti-left. You can hold whatever beliefs you want as long as you don't impinge on my rights. As far as I know, there is no law that requires me to be sympathetic to other people, even of my family, leave alone my religion. And if I didn't break any law by saying this, why isn't the government protecting me from any harm caused by the people who want to harm me for not supporting their cause? The government should not be telling me what kind of citizen I should be or what should I believe in.\n5. A lot of people think that Kanhaiya Kumar or Umar Khaled should be sent to jail. But they already have a case registered on him. Isn't he innocent until proven guilty? And even if Kejriwal is stalling the report or whatever, is that Kanhaiya Kumar's fault? Of course not. Then why isn't the government granting them protection from the religious zealots and jingoists?"<br />Author: 'kartokovitz'  id: 'et1wqa'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/et1wqa/questions_on_the_current_political_movement/</li>

The largest telescope of the same class is the 28-metre-diameter telescope, which is part of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) in Namibia.\n\n#“The installation of the telescope is complete and trial runs are being carried out. It will go live later this year. The first science results from this project will come in a year or two,” Nilay Bhatt, a researcher at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), told ThePrint.\n\nThe project is a collaboration of scientists from BARC, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, along with the Electronics Corporation of India Limited.\n\nWill study Cherenkov radiation\n\nMACE is named after Russian scientist Pavel Cherenkov, who discovered that charged particles glow when they pass through a non-conducting medium under certain conditions. This phenomenon known as the Cherenkov radiation causes the characteristic blue glow in underwater nuclear reactors. Cherenkov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958 with Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm for this discovery.\n\n#“The telescope will study different astrophysical sources in energies of 20 GeV to 10 TeV range,” said Bhatt. This range will allow scientists to study high-energy processes in the universe. It may also aid the search for dark matter — the mysterious substance that is believed to account for over 80 per cent of the universe’s mass.\n\nGamma rays have so much energy that they pass through mirrors used in ordinary optical telescopes. These rays require specialised detectors.\n\nMoreover, the Earth’s atmosphere blocks most of the incoming gamma rays from space, at a height of 10 kilometres from the surface, which makes it difficult for ground-based telescopes to detect them.\n\nPlacing the telescope at higher altitudes gives them a significant advantage to observe the Cherenkov radiation, which is produced when cosmic gamma rays strike the Earth’s upper atmosphere.\n\nMACE is equipped with 356 mirror panels and over 1,000 cameras and will detect very short flashes — lasting just a few nanoseconds — of the Cherenkov radiation. All the components of the telescope have been developed in India.\n\n#“Our work is complementary to other telescopes. Together, telescopes look at the same objects in different energy windows and then scientists put it all together to get the whole picture of the universe. So this telescope is going to add to the sources that are available to us and make our understanding more comprehensive,” said Bhatt.\n\n\nsrc: ThePrint(don't wanna give them clicks)"<br />Author: '10100011a10100011a'  id: 'esu553'<br />Score:20<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/esu553/worlds_highest_and_indias_largest_gammaray/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The Forgotten Sounds of India - Part 1 : The Nasal Sounds'<br />Body: "Sanskrit, Prakrits and all the Indic languages including Apabhramshas are filled with rich varieties of sounds. Some of these sounds are unique to a region, meanwhile some are common to all. Great linguists such as Yaska, Panini and Patanjali managed to create a system in which we could write these sounds in a rigorous, tabulated manner. \n\nThe first effort in these tradition is attributed to Lord Shiva himself .\n\n&gt;नृत्तावसाने नटराजराजो ननाद ढक्कां नवपञ्चवारम्।\nउद्धर्त्तुकामो सनकादिसिद्धादिनेतद्विमर्शे शिवसूत्रजालम्\n\nIn dance, Nataraja (shiva) produced sound from damru 9 + 5 times. \nfor blessing Sanaka and other Siddhas, thus came the net of Siva Sutra\n\nThe Sutra goes like this -\n\n1. a i u ṇ  -  अ इ उ ण्\n\n2. ṛ ḷ k -   ऋ ऌ क्\n\n3. e o ṅ -   ए ओ ङ्\n\n4. ai au c   - ऐ औ च्\n\n5. ha ya va ra ṭ  -  ह य व र ट्\n\n6. la ṇ   -  ल ण्\n\n7. ña ma ṅa ṇa na m  -  ञ म ङ ण न म्\n\n8. jha bha ñ - झ भ ञ्\n\n9. gha ḍha dha ṣ   - घ ढ ध ष्\n\n10. ja ba ga ḍa da ś - ज ब ग ड द श्\n\n11. kha pha cha ṭha tha ca ṭa ta v - ख फ छ ठ थ च ट त व्\n\n12. ka pa y  - क प य्\n\n13. śa ṣa sa r  -  श ष स र्\n\n14. ha l - ह ल्\n\nIn modern terminology one could infer this as a dictionary for code. Why code ? Why dictionary ?. Let us just read on. \n\nPanini's ashtadhyayi is a huge array of codes on how Sanskrit works, we call each line of code, a sutra. But for that code to run, we need a basic dictionary. Siva Sutras act as that basic dictionary. \n\nFor example : If I want to describe a rule for all the sibilants ( श ष स sounds), I would just call the whole group as शर् (refer line 13).\n\nNow, If I want to extend the group and include ह (ha), a sound of exhaling, I would call the whole group as शल् (line 13 + 14)\n\nThus, all the vowels are collectively known as अच् (line 1 --&gt; 4) \n\n**Important to note that the last letter in each of the given lines are just for marking purpose, they are not part of the group. \n\nAll the consonants are collectively known as हल् (line 5 --&gt; 14)\n\nThese are the 14 lines which eventually give way for the popular tabular form of ka, kha, ga.. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this given classification, all the nasal sounds (anu-nasika --&gt; from nose), are from line 7 . The whole group (ञ म ङ ण न म्) can be called ञम्. \n\nThe rule regarding nasal sounds are simple and many. But I want to restrict the scope of this essay to a single question, which nasal sound are we supposed to use within a word.\n\nWhat would be the correct form of the word ranjana ?  रंजन , रन्जन OR रञ्जन  ?\n\nThe answer is रञ्जन . The reason for this is very clear, unambiguous and objective. Basically, the core question is to know which nasal sound is best when we make the transition from ra(र) to ja (ज). \n\nAnd the answer is that nasal sound which belongs to the family of ja (ज) --&gt;   च छ ज झ **ञ**  \n\n**The nasal sound that we are supposed to use it the nasal sound belonging to same family as that of the succeeding letter.** \n\nListing down few words as examples so that the above rule is clear.\n\n1. अङ्क (mark), शङ्ख (conch), रङ्ग (color), लङ्घ (to leap) \n\n2. कञ्चन (gold), लाञ्छन (allegation), व्यञ्जन (consonant)\n\n3. कण्टक (thorn), कण्ठ (throat), मुण्डन (ceremonial balding), कोण्ढाना\n\n4. किन्तु (but), मन्थन (churn), वन्दन (worship), स्कन्ध (shoulders)\n\n5. कम्पन (vibration), जम्बु (jamun), रम्भा (celestial damsel) \n\nThis is how nasal sounds interact with the five families of letters. \n\nThe interaction with antastha (ह य र ल व) and samgharshi (स श ष) sounds is more complex than this.\n\nA large portion of such words are the words formed by sam (सम्) prefix, in which case, all the nasal sounds are represented by anusvara. संस्कृत, विध्वंस, संशय , संघ  and so on. This calls for another essay altogether.  \n\nThe basic books to understand this are books by Panini  i.e Ashtadhyayi. \n\nThanks for your attention.\n\nDhanyavaad _/\\_\n\n\\m/"<br />Author: 'Kootanuvadak007'  id: 'es1is4'<br />Score:113<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/es1is4/the_forgotten_sounds_of_india_part_1_the_nasal/</li>

      <li>Title::: "Muslim Press in India and the Bangladesh Crisis of 1971 - How did Muslim Media report 1971 genocide of Bangladesh, India's role and then the subsequent war - Excerpts"<br />Body: 'Ye sare shuru se hi apna alag raag sunate hain and some of the op eds from that time of Muslim media seem so evil now in retrospect\n\nBut let us retrospect to understand how common Muslims are influenced by the influencers of their community\n\nI am only posting the excerpts of Muslim news papers and op eds based in India -\n\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/naim/ambiguities/14muslimpress.html\n\nPhase One (Prior to 23 March 1971) - When it was hoped that some kind of solution can be reached without India\'s intervention -\n\nThe following quotation from Radiance (Delhi; 14 March 1971) nicely conveys the general reasoning. "The people of East Pakistan," the editorial said, "have risen as one man in support of Sheikh Mujib. The only force which stands in the way of a totally Marxist and independent East Bengal is Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. As such he deserves to be welcomed with open arms by the Western wing, notwithstanding his six points and four conditions."\n\nPhase Two (23 March - 3 December 1971) - preparation of war, India\'s help to Mukti Bahini\n\nIn pursuance of such feelings they urged upon the government of India a policy of "wait and see." On 4 April 1971, Radiance wrote with approval of India\'s "balanced policy," and urged continued discretion. An editorial in the Jamiat Times (9 April 1971) was, however, a bit more critical, even somewhat cynical. It equated the issue of Bangladesh with that of Kashmir,twitted the government of India for showing concern for the Muslims of East Bengal but neglecting the Muslims of India, and suggested that the government of India should either act in this instance the same way it did vis-a-vis communal riots in India, i.e. do nothing, or else it should recognise the Bangladesh Government in Exile and "turn Pakistani lies into truth."\n\nSome other suggestions, made in the initial stages as well as later in the year, were: (i) the government of India should actively discourage the East Bengalis lest their example come to be imitated by the dissidents in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu; (ii) the government of India should hold direct talks with Yahya Khan on all issues in order to settle them bilaterally; (iii) the government of India should avoid open hostilities at all costs and thus prove itself worthy of the heritage of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nThe Muslim press in India was continuously trying to deviate from the Indian position on the crisis and the situation became so acute that the "secular govt" of Indira gandhi had to ban Muslim news papers and Muslim editors were taken in custody\n\nin November 1971, restrictions were placed on the publication of Nasheman (Bangalore), the only Urdu political weekly with a nationwide circulation. Still later, after the war started in December, the editors of Nasheman (Bangalore), Da\'wat (Delhi), Radiance (Delhi), Sangam (Patna), and the Jamiat Times (Delhi) were taken into custody under the Internal Security Act and held without trial for several weeks.\n\nWHY DID INDIRA HAVE TO DO THIS\n\n(3) The question of the refugees:\n\nAlmost no reporting on plight of Muslims fleeing East Pakistan due to persecution by Indian Muslim press. There was some reporting by Patna daily Sangam about the plight of "Bihari Muslims" (non Bengali Muslims) who had gone to East Pakistan after 1947 partition and then fled back to India due to violent retribution by Mukti Bahini and Bengalis.\n\n(4) The role of the Bengalis:\n\nWhile Pakistani news papers considered the East Pakistan crisis as law and order situation, Indian Muslim news papers had objection that how can Bengali Muslims rebel against an Islamic govt\n\nThe learned editor of Sidq-i-Jadid (Lucknow), Maulana Abdul Majid Daryabadi, wrote in the issue of 11 June 1971, that "the Islamism of Pakistan deserves little comment, yet the government there was after all a Muslim government, rebellion against which cannot be forgiven."\n\nHe maintained this stance even a year later. "Pakistan is after all a Muslim state," he wrote, "like Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Those who rebel against it are to be condemned as are all those who rebel against a Muslim state. This is a shar\'i fact which cannot be glossed over by using such labels as \'Mukti Fauj\' and \'Freedom Fighters\'" (Sidq-i-Jadid; 2 July 1972).\n\nJamiat Times of Delhi on Benaglis of East pakistan -\n\n"We wrote earlier, and we do not fear to write again, that whether it be the present tension between India and Pakistan or the massacre of Bengalis and non-Bengalis in East Pakistan or the influx of lakhs of homeless refugees, the responsibility for everything lies squarely with the leaders of East Pakistan. One man can set fire in a moment to an entire garden. We curse all traitors, be they in India or in Pakistan. A man should concern himself with the welfare of the country where he lives, otherwise he should leave it and go some other place" (3 December 1971).\n\nJamiat Times continued to mock the Bengali Muslims\n\n"The Muslims of India consider many complaints of these angry (Bengali) elements to be just. Yet they also totally disapprove the way these elements have torn apart their own state. Those who committed that crime may have gained some temporary honour, but Muslim public opinion will always regard them as subversives, and history shall describe them as those who tore to pieces the integral unity of the millat."\n\nJamiat Times also said this -\n\nno leader like the late Maulana Muhammad Ali arose at this time in India to wage a campaign like the Khilafat Movement and thereby protest the dissolution of the millat-e-Islamiya."\n\nBasically they wanted some Indian Muslim to rise against the Bengali rebellion and stop the partition of Pakistan\n\nPhase Three (The War)\n\nWhen war broke out jamiat Times came openly in support of Indian state and asked Muslims to make sacrifice for the country\n\nPrior to that, on 26 November 1971, Mufti Zia-ul-Haq had written in his Jamiat Times: "When our own borders are endangered we are ready to forget our complaints and make every sacrifice for our country." Radiance, on 5 December 1971, carried an editorial that expressed much the same sentiments,\n\nDespite this stance, many Muslim editors and journalists were arrested and kept in prison for long time even after war was over. It should be noted that most of the prominent figures of Muslim print media were already under arrest by then.\n\nIn spite of such sentiments and avowals, on 8 December 1971, the government of India arrested, under the Internal Security Act, several prominent Muslims, including Mufti Zia-ul-Haq of the Muslim Majlis and the Jamiat Times, Maulana Abul Lais and Maulana Muhammad Yusuf of the Jama\'at-e-Islami (Hind), the leaders of the Tamir-i-Millat and the Ittihad-al-Muslimin of Hyderabad, and the editors of Dawat, Radiance, Sangam, and Nasheman. Some of them were kept in prison, without trial, for as many as forty-one days! No one from the national press protested against these arrests, which were entirely unnecessary besides being, to say the least, legally questionable.\n\nWhy did Secular Congress and Indira did this to Muslim journalists?\n\nPhase Four (After the War)\n\nThey could be neither jubilant nor sanguine. The following quotation from Haqeeqat (Lucknow: n.d.) conveys well the feelings at that time:\n\n"The chief reason for the resentment of the Muslims is that the event of the independence of Bangladesh and her severance of all ties with Pakistan was generally celebrated in India as if the \'victory\' had been gained against the Muslims themselves. Insulting and provocative slogans were raised against them in public meetings in this country. A second reason is that the Muslims in general do believe that the war was primarily fought for the purpose of destroying the integral unity of Pakistan. Our Ministry of Information hands out all sorts of propaganda but does nothing to dispel the dejection and resentment of Indian Muslims" (Quoted in Sidq-i-Jadid; 21 January 1972).\n\nLa Ilahi ka nara lagane wale were hurt that Insulting and provocative slogans were raised against Pakistan. They looked the celebration of Indian victory as celebration for Indian victory against Islam\n\nA second reason is that the Muslims in general do believe that the war was primarily fought for the purpose of destroying the integral unity of Pakistan.\n\nDespite the genocide of Bengali Muslims, all the Indian Muslim news papers could see this war as a mean to destroy the integrity of Pakistan\n\nNida-i-Millat of Lucknow camew up with Zionist conspiracy in breaking of Pakistan -\n\n00 Zionist agents were sent by Israel to Bangladesh for the purpose of fomenting trouble and training Bengali rebels. It was also asserted that Rahman Sobhan, a prominent economist and radical of Bangladesh, had met in Paris with Daniel Cohn-Bendit ("a Jew"), who then went on to Israel to arrange for the agents while Rahman Sobhan himself came to India to coordinate plans with Indian communists.\n\nWe only desire our country to be aware of the delicate (nazuk) sentiments and feelings of the Muslim world, especially of the Arabs."\n\nAnd guess what within a week of pakistani surrender, both Indian and Pakistani Muslim press started talking about Gazwa E hind prophecy\n\nBut by far the most telling thing in this respect was the publication, within a week of the ceasefire and in both India and Pakistan simultaneously, of the alleged prophesies of Shah Ni\'matullah Wali. These prophesies occur in two poems ascribed to the famous 15th century Iranian saint and are by all accounts total forgeries. They are not found in any authentic collection of his verses; their language is full of Indianisms of recent origin; and they made their first appearance in the late 19th century in India. They have, however, a most curious hold over the minds of average Indian Muslims. It is a measure of the latter\'s ignorance and emotional insecurity that these verses begin to circulate among them any time an event occurs that they regard as a blow to their peculiar vision of a triumphant Islam. The fascination of these poems lies perhaps not so much in the fact that their verses can be interpreted to have foretold events of recent history, as in their implication that what was happening was part of a grand scheme ordained by the Almighty and therefore to be accepted sanguinely. Further, since they promise near the end a resurgence of Muslim authority in India and the arrival of the promised Mahdi, they help soothe the wounds of the psyche. These poems first appeared in minor journals but were soon reprinted in major magazines, including the Shabistan Digest, one of the most popular Urdu magazines in India. What is so amazing -- and so revealing of a uniform prevalence of ignorance -- is that these poems appeared in print within a week of the ceasefire in both India and Pakistan, and quite independently.\n\nThe morale of Muslims was low according to these Muslim news papers and how they handled it\n\nThe commentators in the Muslim press adopted various tacks to shore up this collapse of morale. One theme that was repeated incessantly by all journals was that it was Pakistan, a country, and not Islam, an ideology, that had suffered defeat in the recent war; that it was one variety of nationalism that had lost to another; and that the ideology of Islam still remained as meaningful and relevant as before. Pakistan met with this calamity because the Pakistanis failed to make Islam a reality in their social and political life.\n\nthe fact that millions of Muslims cut themselves off from their origin (asl), and that enmity has come to exist between two Muslim communities. Common to all the four calamities are the disintegration of the ummat and the guilt and sinfulness of the Muslims. It is a time to feel ashamed, recognise our faults, seek forgiveness of God, and improve our condition through deeds and acts."\n\nAza\'im on 7th feb, 1972-\n\n"Pakistan was created through the efforts of the Muslims who lived outside of the Pakistan regions.\n\nMeans Muslims living in current India. That\'s what they acknowledged.\n\nConsequently, we (the Indian Muslims) have had to pay the price for the partition of the country. In India we have paid it for the past twenty-four years; in Bangladesh we are paying it now; and, God forbid, we may have to pay it even in Pakistan in the coming years, or so it becomes more clear every day."\n\nNida-i-Millat again said -\n\nPakistan came into existence through the sacrifices of Indian Muslims, who then had to pay dearly for it. They were abandoned by their erstwhile leaders. Many of them had to leave their relatives and properties and go to live in an alien land, where they were now in grave danger. Those who stayed behind have had to suffer similarly in communal riots.\n\nThe worry for legitimacy of Pakistan movement by a Lucknow news paper in 1972, after Pakistan was broken\n\nThe creation of Bangladesh does in no way negate the validity of the original movement for Pakistan.\n\nIf the East Bengalis are so keen about a separate Bengali culture they should not have joined the Pakistan Movement in the first place. Further, if their Bengali nationalism is so important for them they should now merge their country with the Indian Bengal.\n\nkhisiani Billi Khambha noche, but why this khisiani Billi was crying while living in India -\n\nIn 1946, when the erstwhile North Western Frontier Province and the united Punjab had shown little enthusiasm for Pakistan, it was the Bengali Muslims who came out so strongly for a united Pakistan. It is now meaningless, therefore, for the Bengalis to claim that they have won their independence from West Pakistan. It should perhaps be put the other way around.\n\nThe leaders of East Bengal displayed a lack of patience and forbearance. They responded too emotionally and thereby caused great loss of life. They should have known that the Pakistani army would be tough in its reprisal.\n\nWow madarchod\n\nLook at their wet dream -\n\nFinally, if the initial partition of the country was all that bad, as the Bengali leaders now claim, then Bangladesh should now join India. That may persuade even Pakistan to do the same. That would indeed be a glorious day for Indian Muslims.\n\nConclusion by the author -\n\nConclusion\n\nNo radical change occurred in the thinking of the Indian Muslims either. Their immediate reaction to the various developments in the crisis were, as we saw above, more imbued with fundamentalism in some respects than the responses of the Pakistanis. One got the feeling that the thinking of a significant and large group of Indian Muslims was still very much governed by two potentially most dangerous notions, namely: (1) there is one Muslim nation, one Muslim language, and one Muslim culture; and (2) those who are not with them in these beliefs are against them, and, therefore, against Islam itself.\n\nIt was similar irrational thinking that had led them, prior to 1947, to give overwhelming support to the demand for Pakistan, a demand that allegedly arose out of a desire to protect Muslim minorities but which in its fulfillment left them high and dry. That demand got the support that it did because it appealed to the Indian Muslims\' belief that, having "ruled over India for one thousand years," they could only be either kings (in Pakistan) or king-makers (in India). Mr. Jinnah asked the Indian Muslims to unite for Pakistan, without offering them any details of what that Pakistan was going to be like. "Unite and remain separate from the non-Muslim, who should have no say in Muslim affairs," that was the cry in those days. That still seems to be the cry raised by a large number of the leading elements in the community.\n\nIt is a dismal picture indeed.\n\nCredits: u/ranjan_zehereela2014'<br />Author: 'GanguTeli'  id: 'erufmg'<br />Score:52<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/erufmg/muslim_press_in_india_and_the_bangladesh_crisis/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'The history of secularism'<br />Body: 'Secularism, the much maligned and abused word by the Indian left has a very interesting history to it and I wanted to attempt and provide a brief (very brief) overview on just what Secularism is and what is the difference between this and “secularism”, how it evolved and the Dharmic context to it.\n\nTo start out with, by design, pretty much all the polytheistic Empires, be it the Romans, Greeks, Chinese or Indian empires were Secular. So what is Secular to begin with? Secularism is when the state is run independent of religion and there is complete freedom to worship any religion of your choice and the state either disassociates itself from all faiths or supports them equally.\n\nRome and Greece did have an official (of sorts) Pantheon of Gods and the state did fund temples for these deities but it had complete toleration for all other ‘pagan’ faiths and never persecuted anyone for worshiping a deity that was not in the official pantheon. What persecution did exist was on ethnicity and not on religion – for ex the Jews of Judea.\n\nDharmic Empires were different in that they supported faiths of all kinds. So a Buddhist Pala empire supported Hindu Temples, a Hindu empire supported Buddhist Viharas and Jaina temples. Merchant guilds funded generously all faiths. So Tamil Hindu trade guilds supported a Choodamani Vihara in Nagapatinam (Buddhist monastery) and ditto Buddhist guilds. There was the occasional conflict between faiths, but this was never given any form of state support. To give you one more such example, consider the,\n\nNalanda University – Nalanda was a site / prosperous city associated with both Mahavira and Buddhism in existence from 1,500 BCE at least. This greatest of all Buddhist monasteries and universities was founded by a Hindu Gupta emperor named Kumaragupta 1. From here, the very Hindu Gupta empire (which Leftist history attributes as a “anti Buddhist” empire) oversaw the massive expansion of this Buddhist monastery and built it up into a large university for Buddhist students. Hsuien Tsang even records a massive temple to Buddha built by the Gupta emperor, so clearly there was no conflict between Buddhism and Hinduism, and not only that, the largest patrons of Buddhist (in terms of money and effort) were the Hindu Gupta emperors (in that era). Post the fall of the Guptas, another Hindu Emperor, Harsha picked up the baton, Harsha himself was possibly a Hindu converted to Buddhism reconverted to Hinduism, though this did not affect in any way his support for Nalanda and Buddhism in general. His court had Hindu priests, scholars and Buddhist monks in attendance.  As was the norm across India, one way for temples and monasteries to maintain their expenses was to give them both tax free status as well as allot them lands and villages from which they were entitled to all the revenue (interestingly, even the Jews in distant Kerala were allotted villages and tax breaks, as were the Parsis in Gujarat), and it was said that under the Guptas and Harsha, Nalanda had more than 100 villages to farm revenues from. Then the Palas took over, and now we had a Buddhist empire in charge and they switched to supporting Hindu temples and places of learning and even went as far as to appoint a Brahmin scholar as the dean of Nalanda. \n\nInterestingly, around the time of the Pala, Buddhism had thanks to its monastic ways and focus on inward self along with the resurgent and now evangelical Hindu faith thanks to Shankara had started a serious decline amongst the people, but the various empires continued to lavish funding upon it. This in my opinion disconnected the Monks even further from reality as there was no need to expand the faith to secure funding and its existence and the monks continued to retreat inward, but we digress, as you can see though, a core Buddhist entity was founded by Hindu emperors, funded by Hindu emperors and merchant guilds and only towards the end did a Buddhist empire take charge. Said Buddhist empire was in turn a great patron of the Hindu faith.\n\nThis was not an exception, in the deep south (at around the same time of the Pala), the Great Raja Raja Chola was a great patron of the Buddhists though being a staunch Shaivaite himself. The Choodamani Vihara (a monastery and Buddhist shrine) in Nagapatinam was built by the Chola Emperor at the behest of the Srivijayan (Indonesian) Emperor (whose father was called ChudamaniDeva thus Choodamani Vihara) in Nagapatinam. Nagapatinam itself was a renowned Buddhist centre from the time of Ashoka and had continuously been patronised by various Hindu Empires. Many many more such examples abound of Dharmic kings patronising all faiths without any consideration to their own personal faith.\n\nWith the rise of Xtianity in Rome (and Europe) though the scenario changed and it changed drastically. The Monotheistic faiths were a jealous faith that afforded no space for any rivals, and when Constantine officially announced Xtianity as the defacto religion of the Roman state, it became deeply enmeshed within the administration. Many Roman emperors were devout Christians and inspired by their advisors (who were devout Xtians as well), a deep intolerance for the original Roman faith and also Judaism was born and this resulted in many purges, massacres and in general the theocratic state deeply rooted in Christianity was also birthed along with it.\n\nMany a Xtian ruler and emperor saw it as their duty to Christ to convert all ‘heathen’ and Christianity went from a mere religion to a socio-political entity. The early Christian state became a state dedicated to upholding Xtian values, and to ensure this, the clergy (often the most literate group) secured positions of power in the administration and governance. Laws were derived from Xtian principles and pretty much all other faiths were legally declared as illegal faiths and the punishment for worship of these often meant death. The Kings at this point still retained a certain degree of independence and held themselves the equal of the church at this point.\n\nOn Dec 25th, 800 AD the balance of power shifted entirely the way of the Church when Pope LEO III crowned Charlamegene (spelling?) the emperor, thus for the first time in Europe, the temporal (physical realm) was now subservient to the metaphysica religious realm. In essence the Pope was from whom all authority flowed, and even the most mighty of emperors was subservient to this ‘servant of God’. In other words, this was when the Church took full charge and was the ultimate arbiter of destinies. The Church around this time issued the Corpus Canoncia (literally the Canon) that was a book that defined through rules and ordinances became the judicial system by which European states were governed and in many ways to this day still are.\n\nIslam followed a similar path and had similar ideas and principles where the Faith was superior to Empires and power flowed from Mohd to the kings / emperors (not getting into this in a lot of detail at this point)\n\nDuring this period, the Church absorbed a lot of land and via measures like the Tithe (where a percent of the income of every person flowed to the church) generated a lot of wealth. It used its power amongst the ruling classes to launch crusade after crusade against the Northern Pagans (which resulted in genocide but did succeed) and Islam. It launched many pogroms against Judaism, and even sects within Christianity. What the Catholic church did not consider kosher (excuse the choice of words), it branded a hearsay and it viciously supressed. Take the  Albigensian crusade for instance, launched by the French Kings against the “Cathar” hearsay in Southern France, it was nothing short of genocide in which an estimated half a million Cathars were killed. It was launched only because the then Pope Innocent III (the irony!) deemed it necessary.  The church as you can see had a narrow defined dogma outside of which no tolerances were permitted. \n\nNow to juxtapose it with our previous Dharmic examples, there is no major Xtian ruler who was a patron of Judaism and Islam as that would have been political (and maybe literal) suicide. The Church determined the laws, the church determined taxation policies, the church bishops and deacons were also the judges who sat in on trials, the Pope crowned Kings and emperors and all authority flowed from them. In India the Emperors declared land grants, in Europe, the Church determined what was due to it. The church (via the Pope) even had armies and waged active wars, in essence, the Church was a power unto itself and held all the levers of power including the religious and metaphysical. \n\nThe first breaks with the Church happened around the Western Schism, but this was quickly healed. The first move towards Secularism happened along with the Reformation. While this evolved from a theological dispute, the Protestant branch of Xtianity offered nobles a lot more political freedom, however the key aspect of the political side of the reformation was when the Protestant Kings started seizing Church lands and when Christian III of Denmark made himself the head of the Lutheran church of Denmark (1536), it was the first time since 800 AD or roughly 8 centuries did all power flow from one spigot, the Head of the state. King Henry VIII followed this up in England with the “Act of the Monastries” which basically disbanded all monasteries, took back all church land and church revenues and again, like Christian III a few years before, named himself the head of both the church and state. He (Henry) took it a step forward and even disassociated the new church (of England) from the Papacy. This did have massive short term side effects though as the Church also ran poor houses, hospitals and schools and this move created more poverty in the short term than it helped resolve it.\n\nThe foundation and justification for all this? The “Doctrine of 3 Estates” published by Martin Luther namely politia (politics), the oeconomia (economics), and the ecclesia (Church). In other words, the State, the people and the Church. Luther believed God was supreme and sat on top of all 3, but these three were equal nonetheless. A state of equilibrium last seen during the Roman period. Note – Luther did not explicitly pen something called “The Doctrine of 3 estates” but it is a common thread in his writings.\n\nThus was laid the seeds of what would eventually become modern Secularism, but the key thing to be noted here is that Secularism per se did not change the way the common man lived, Christianity was still the only language of the state, but it was instead a struggle between the Pope and Various Kings to establish power and the right to farm revenue from lands!

Given what happened to the community, they take cognisance of the threats of Islamic fundamentalism, and for the same reason, root for an actually secular (read UCC) to a Hindu State depending from person to person. One of my favorite intellectual, Ashish Dhar (Follow Upword right now!) is a KP and I'm a fan of Sushil Pandit too. \n\nBut like all communities, they got their fare share of cucks, from absolute whores like Nidhi Razdan who'd climb into bed with someone like Omar Abdullah, the guy who's very father sat on his ass while Exodus happened under his premiership, to virtue signalling chuttads like Rahul Pandita and Aditya Raj Kaul, to woke people like a few of my college mates, whose think trending #HumWapasAayenge is going to actually return them to their homelands. \n\n**#HUMWAAPISAAYENGE**\n\nLet me put it out for you. \n\nLAWDA NAHI WAPAS JAA PAAOGE \n\nThe amount of virtue signalling amongst these cucks is unbelievable. Rahul Pandita tweeted recently to the tune that CAA is like Gau Raksha for stray cows while the ones in Gaushalas suffered. Valid point, but speaking against amnesty to people who are suffering at hands of Islamic Intolerance. The same reason Kashmiri Pandits are nowhere to be found in Kashmir?\n\nNidhi Razdan is, well, dating Omar Abdullah. Who is father of Omar Abdullah? Farooq Abdullah! Who was the CM of J and K when exodus happened, under whose jurisdiction was law and order when Jihadi mobs ran amok? Farooq Abdullah. I'd find hard to talk to such people. Madam decided it's totally okay to fuck them. \n\n**DONT POLITICISE OUR STRUGGLE**\n\nAditya Raj Kaul objects to Harshvardhan politicising the issue by lauding government to abrogate 370. Arrey madarchod why don't you want to politicise the issue? The only reason any government will take concrete steps is if their is political gains behind this issue. Look at muslims, any demand regarding their community gets politicised and that's why there are so many parties in India parroting their cause. All these 30 years, one party, stood for Hindu causes, and all you got for us is virtue signalling? \n\nWhat cause in India gets accomplished without political patronage. Ram Mandir? Mandal Commission? Shah Bano? It's amazing to think KP's have the history being some of the most scholarly communities in India and yet some of their intellectuals are this stupid. \n\n**THEY REMOVED 370. BUT WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR KASHMIRI PANDITS?**\n\nOk. Let's send Kashmiri Pandits back. Infact, no one has stopped them right? Why don't they go back? We all know why they don't. Ashish Dhar in his wonderful video about Kashmiri Pandit exodus says that Hindus of India should not expect Kashmiri Pandits to go back because even with 370 gone, the conditions that lead to ouster of KPs still exist, and people should put pressure on the government to make sure they are safe. \n\nHow the fuck is government supposed to ensure their safety when law and order is in hands of Jihadists like the Abdullahs and Muftis? The same people under whose nose exodus happened? To make Kashmir safe for KPs again, the first thing that needs to be done right is law and order, and 370 abrogation is the first step in that. For 30 years, nothing concrete got done, and now when 370 is abrogated you are sad things are not moving quickly enough? \n\n**And finally, to my Viraat Pandit Hindu Bretheren**\n\nI apologise if I may have hurt any of your feelings in this post. This post has been totally directed to cucks like people who I mentioned above. In my life, I know KPs who I look up to in many ways. But their is a huge problem that these people might alienate Virat KPs and desensitise  non-KP Hindus towards their cause. by their virtue signalling. The fight against Abrahamic tolerance goes through the valley of political consolidation, and all of Hindus need to politically consolidate behind this cause.\n\nHAR HAR MAHADEV."<br />Author: 'stolenrhymes'  id: 'eqv5iz'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eqv5iz/if_cucks_from_all_communities_in_india_got/</li>

      <li>Title::: "India's rape problem won't end until rape becomes less taboo."<br />Body: 'Think about it from the mindset of the rapist. They\'re not just driven by lust, but also the urge to dominate and in the case of Indian rapists, to humiliate. In most of the horrific cases, the rapists wanted to punish the woman for resisting their advances. \n\nWhy does that happen? Why do these men feel like rape is the most befitting way to punish a woman? Because the life of an Indian rape survivor is a terrible one. Most Indians view a woman who got raped and her family completely differently compared to before the incident, even if they did nothing wrong to receive that kind of response. There\'s this strong sentiment of *"Oh no, what could they do now? No one would marry her or her sisters after such a shameful incident"*.  The media actually doesn\'t help by consistently covering it, perhaps that\'s what the rapists want. \n\nIn developed societies, we rarely hear about criminal-minded men punishing women by raping them. The reason is because the woman doesn\'t have a lot to lose in terms of social reputation, and the rapist has so much to lose. I hope I made my point clear that although rape is clearly a punishable offense, some of the social stigma needs to go away.'<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'eqr1uq'<br />Score:13<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eqr1uq/indias_rape_problem_wont_end_until_rape_becomes/</li>

Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That’s had a big impact on my work.”* \n\nI'm not interested in which is better; but based on my observation, it seems like people who live in sunny climates like Indians, Southern Europeans and Latin Americans rely more on their intuition whereas people of colder climates like East Asians and Northern Europeans trust their reasoning. \n\nFor those who don't know intuition, it is also the gut feeling or hunch that people get. Intuitive thought or action comes very quickly and often times, you can't explain how you thought about or did it. It is very different to deliberate and analytical thought or action, where you think everything through methodically. \n\n**I think Indians are very intuitive, the less Westernized they are**. For example, have you noticed how easily many Indians could understand and speak multiple languages, without learning its grammar? In contrast, many Brits, Americans or Japanese know only one language. Many Indians could also learn a certain skill like singing, driving or selling a product very quickly without much tutoring. It just feels more natural and spontaneous when we see an Indian doing a certain performance. In contrast, many Indians are relatively poor in following rules, doing things in a disciplined and structured way and  controlling irrational thoughts and feelings. \n\nWhat's your opinion on this?"<br />Author: 'KLBikey'  id: 'eqc8ae'<br />Score:19<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eqc8ae/does_the_indian_society_rely_more_on_intuition/</li>

Today, I was watching an episode of [Crime Aaj Tak by Shams Tahir Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNCuPBgvPxQ) which throws some light on this aspect.\n\nNIA is the topmost security agency of our country formed after 26/11 by then UPA govt. and yet, ironically, Congress itself is questioning the NIA today. Though Pappu may be entirely politically motivated, there are a few blips in recent years which raises some interesting questions.\n\nFirst one pertains to the [Pathankot Airbase Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathankot_Air_Base_Attack) in 2016 by JeM terrorists. The terrorists had entered the Airbase on the morning on 1st Jan 2016 wearing Army uniforms undetected. Later, when investigation was performed on the vehicle, it was traced to one Salvinder Singh who was the SP of Pathankot. When asked about the vehicle, Salvinder Singh made a story that he was returning from a new year party the day before and the terrorists blocked him on the way, beat him up and took away his vehicle. This story had obvious holes, why would they leave him alive knowing he was SP, for instance, how would they know he would be found there, etc.\n\nBecause of this, the central govt. then transferred the case to NIA and interestingly, the NIA gave a clean chit to Salvinder Singh! In 2017, new govt. forms in Punjab who suspends Salvinder and starts a fresh state level investigation against him. And now, in 2019, Salvinder is booked for corruption and sexual offence charges totalling to 15 years imprisonment. How could the NIA had given this guy a clean cheat 2 years ago?\n\nSimilar holes exist in the Pulwama attack. How did so much quantity of RDX reach the attackers right under the nose of the administration? Its well known that some organization has taken responsibility for this but why hasn't NIA come up with any conclusion or traced any culprit in this?\n\nDisclaimer: By raising and asking questions like these, you don't become an anti-national, it just shows that you care for your nation."<br />Author: 'louis_pasteur'  id: 'eq4ixh'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/eq4ixh/from_pathankot_to_pulwama_to_davinder_singh_the/</li>
