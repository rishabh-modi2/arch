Therefore, one has to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.9, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crxfajqd6i351.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebcddac26a5f1c7a2d04c56252a8b1b46d907c8e\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder kṣatriya. Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination."  \n"Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared.

And I get it, kids are a bit stressed during these classes and staring on a screen for a long time can take its toll. And a little fun is okay! What you have to understand is that there is a very fine line between having fun and being disrespectful.\n\nAfter more than two months of online classes (from three different institutes), I've seen almost all types of intrusions.\n\nBroadly,  there are those who just want to have a little fun and there are those sick fucks who derive some sort of sadistic pleasure from disturbing the class.\n\n The first category includes the ones who play songs in between or even sing songs in a terrible, terrible voice. Or a couple of people who start an argument of their own in case the teacher forgets to or chooses to notmute them. That is almost fun. Sometimes, even the teacher joins in for a few minutes before getting back to teaching. Against this, I have no problem. According to me, these guys just want to kick back and relax a bit. No issues with that.\n\nComing on to the second category, this includes the ones who write malicious comments about fellow students or, in most cases, teachers. This category also includes those who utter some of the most unspeakable words in the Hindi language. Whether they play inappropriate songs, or just switch on their mics and start uttering curses, both are equally bad. It is this category which I have a problem with.  I mean, abe chutiyon, tumhe nahi padhna, to na padho. Kisi ne school building ya class m band to kiya nahi h tumhe, jo class m hona zaruri h. Nikal jao class se.

Aur teacher ne tumhara kya bigaada h? usko gaaliyan kyu dete ho, teacher ko kyu torture karte ho yaar?

Its like tum gire pade ho, teacher tumhe haath deta h, aur tum uske muh par thook dete ho. Kyu aisi harkate karte ho bhai? Kyu??\nAnd the worst ones are those who go personal against the teacher. Abe bsdk, na hi tumne agle ka din kharab kiya, tumne baaki students ka bhi din kharab kiya h. Tum log kalank ho bacho ke naam pe bhenchod. Apni zindagi barbaad to kar hi rahe ho, saath m apne parents ki bhi.\n\nAnd you sick fucks deserve every bit of these insults.

      <li>Title::: 'Schooling is a scam whose time has come'<br />Body: 'I might be wrong here, but I am sharing my opinions based on my own experience and observations.\n\nMy brief story\nI was born in a village and moved to the city when I was 7. With a just above average ability to learn things, I was soon doing quite well in the school. In a couple of years, I was doing well academically, was captaining a few sports teams and was getting appreciated for my artistic capabilities.\n\nBut soon, I started to develop several complexes, most driven by my teachers. At different points in time, my teachers commented on my dark skin colour, my economic status (one teacher called me a beggar for asking someone for an eraser), mocking me because my mother didn’t speak English in parent teacher meeting and embarrassing me because I didn’t have a proper birth certificate (I was born at my home in my village, and we didn’t have the kind of documents the city hospitals give).\n\nI went from being a highly confident and a kid who showed potential in several areas to almost failing subjects. I was hit by teachers, I was made to run in hot sun with my bag on, and once, a teacher put a label “I didn’t do my homework” on my head and made me stand in front of junior class students.. I was sinking...\n\nNow, the parents of my “intelligent” friends used to get together and some of my colleagues weren’t allowed to hangout with us “dull students”. \n\nAs a dull guy, I really enjoyed hanging out with my new group of “dull” students way more than my previous “intelligent” group. There was no judgement, no competition and that’s where I learned what real friendship really means. In fact, the comfort led me to a peace of mind that brought out my best again. I started topping my class, and my “dull” friend group started cheering me. \n\nLong story shot, I kept going to flashes of the same complexes throughout my career, but I keep going the time I spent with my “dull” friends to group to gather self confidence. On most measures of career development, people would call me highly successful (what I think of it is a whole different story).\n\nWhile I was able to somewhat harness my potential, most of my friends classified as “dull” never recovered. I spent a lot of time with them and I know they were no less talented. But once labelled “nalayak”, it isn’t easy to recover..your self confidence goes for a toss and you stop fighting. \n\nIt’s a lot of students who go through this..the incompetent teachers and the competitive parents don’t realise what a kid is going through. The reason most of us are able to tell all these stories in great detail is because every day in the school is a struggle.\n\nIf I can go back in time with internet, and if I had the choice, I’ll never go to school...and I am confident that I’ll develop into a much better human being and would be creating more value for the society.\n\nI truly believe the time has come...we need to take a plunge and destroy the physical schooling system...and as far as community learning goes, school isn’t the only place with sports grounds or a place for kids to hangout..and all students don’t need to learn the same text books and the same subjects...'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'gxoem4'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gxoem4/schooling_is_a_scam_whose_time_has_come/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'The Art &amp; Science of Editing Wikipedia - /u/BhismaPita'<br />Body: '#The Art &amp; Science of Editing Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is one of the 5 most frequented sites on the Internet. It is frequently seen as an authoritative and factual source of information.\n\nWhether we like it or not, if it is on Wikipedia, it is truth.\n\nThe theory goes that because multiple editors can create and maintain articles, on average, each article should organically evolve as people add/remove/edit things. The theory assumes that biases, opinions, will get removed and Wikipedia will remain a neutral guide.\n\nUnfortunately, every editor has their own biases which they view to be facts. This has prevented otherwise legitimate alternative viewpoints and equally valid &amp; significant ideas from being fairly represented on Wikipedia.\n\nThis is especially the case in fairly representing Hinduism and India. Whether it be its history, traditions, and other facts and figures. Others view these topics from a Western lens, but now we need to talk about these topics from our indigenous lens.\n\nDoing this correctly will be a big service in correcting the falsehoods, myths, and downright lies that are often perpetrated in the news and media.\n\nSo how do we do this? Let\'s dive into it. I will first talk about strategy and then get into tactics.\n\n#**Strategy**\n\n1. *No in-fighting.*\n\nIn correcting the narrative, and reversing the Western gaze, a lot of us get passionate and end up attacking one another on trivial matters within our own community. I believe this has done more harm than good. We should try to focus on the bigger picture and keep our edits focused on the positive details.\nE.g. for example, it does not help to post irrelevant facts from Mahatma Gandhi\'s life to bolster Godse\'s position. This kind of infighting is harmful and destructive. Instead of addressing the systemic issues, we end up infighting and fail to make any real impact.\n\nLearn to recognize allies and learn to support one another on the Wikipedia community.\n\n2. *Don\'t lose your cool*\n\nWhen you start working on Wikipedia, you will be tempted to focus on the most public and discussed topics in the news. These topics are highly visited and so any changes you make on these topics will be carefully examined my many other editors and if you did not make carefully thought out edits, you will quickly find your edits reversed.\n\nAt this point, I\'ve seen many people lose their cool, get angry, and then quickly get warned and ultimately banned. This is no way to be a member of Wikipedia.\n\n3. *Go deep to make real impact*\n\nContinuing from the above point, while you are tempted to make edits on the latest political event or story, as a new editor (or even an experienced editor), the impact of your work will be felt a lot more on what I like to call "Root articles" (this is my own made up term).\n\nFor example, the Swastika is often seen as a sign of Nazism in the Western world and is linked to genocide and Hitler. Breaking this association would be a big win for Hindus around the world and reclaim a sense of pride in our collective identities.\n\nThe Nazi sign was actually a Hooked Cross, not a Swastika at all. But due to a number of reasons, people have mistakenly associated it with the Swastika. If you made edits to shift the baggage from the Swastika page into the Hooked Cross page (does such a page even exist?), you would go much further in changing the narrative.\n\n4. *Understand context*\n\nAn editor recently reached out to me for help because a page he had created was rejected. The user had taken one isolated incident that happened and made it into a new Wikipedia page. This is likely to not work. Wikipedia runs on what\'s known as "Notability" (search for "WP:Notability"). An article or even an edit must be of enough importance that it should be on the site. Would one isolated incident that happened in the world merit inclusion in an encyclopedia? Usually not. But if the story is attached to a bigger theme or news story, then this incident might be included. So understand the context of what you\'re writing and ask yourself: is this significant enough? If not, where else might it be useful?\n\n5. *Understand policies*\n\nWikipedia runs on a number of rules, guidelines, policies, and suggestions. It is a democratic way of moving things along. While there are administrators with far reaching power, they usually do not intrude on the regular everyday things happening on the site. There are TENS of millions of pages, and no administrator has the time or resources to go through it all. Most administrators, just like most editors, are volunteers who do this for fun.\n\nSo, understand the policies carefully. The best place to start is to go into the search bar, type in "WP:NPOV" and get familiar with the policies that makes Wikipedia run. This will make it easier for you to make your edits stick. You will discover many other ones as well.\n\nAt the same time...\n\n6. *Just start!*\n\nThese policies are long and complicated. You will learn them in action with use. Learn the basics and start the edits.\n\n7. *Just don\'t be contentious.*\n\nThis means don\'t be needlessly controversial and go after the "hard topics" right away. Get started with neutral topics that you know a lot about. Expand those articles. Maybe it\'s botany, engineering, or something else. This will be a good exposure for you to learn how to make good edits, and get used to using Wikipedia.\n\n#**Tactics**\n\n1. Make an account, and choose a neutral username.\nWikipedia runs on users being, on the whole, neutral and without a bias. So don\'t choose a controversial username or profile characteristic that highlights your biases.\n\n2. Use the visual editor to make changes. Find it in your settings, or when you make your first change. It will make making edits as easy as using Microsoft Word.\n\n3. Use talk pages. You know how I said that Wikipedia runs in a democratic way? The talk pages are often great places to see what others users are saying about a topic, and discussing before they make an edit. Use the talk pages on each article to see what others are saying, see if you can contribute to the discussion, and go forward. This is so important, so don\'t overlook this!\n\n4. Use Portals and Projects. For example, if you search for "Portal:Hinduism" you will find many articles that need to be improved, many tasks that need to be updated. There are many dedicated volunteer editors trying very hard to improve these articles, but they just need someone to take charge or contribute. These articles are usually the deep impact and useful articles. Prioritize working on these articles.\n\n5. Don\'t get shaken if things change. Someone might revert your edits. That\'s fine. Approach it all with curiosity, learn from your mistakes (if it is a mistake), and get better. If you\'re dealing with a disruptive editor who refuses to see reason, engage with him/her on their talk pages, and if needed, leave them a warning (search for standard templates that Wikipedia has prepared. It is completely okay to do this if you aren\'t breaking any rules/policies, and they are).\n\n6. Have fun! I\'ve been making edits on Wikipedia for 5+ years. It can be frustrating, difficult, but also very rewarding when you start making connections, and changing the overall narrative.\n\n7. Finally, treat this work as your bhakti, your karma yoga. As Shri Krishna says, make all this into a form of seva. What can be greater than giving knowledge to the world? So treat your work like seva, like bhakti onto Paramatma, and editing Wikipedia will become a means for you to attain moksha.\n\n#**Finally...**\n\n*Always use credible sources.*\n\nWikipedia is an encyclopedia. This means it runs on having good solid proof of every addition you make on the site. So, please do your research in detail ahead of time, gather your sources, and use the Citation Wizard when you make an edit. Try to find secondary sources, not primary sources. Try to find academic journals (the highest standard), textbooks, or works by scholars if you want your edits to truly stick.

Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nSince one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yajña means Lord Viṣṇu, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Viṣṇu. The Vedas enjoin: yajño vai viṣṇuḥ. In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajñas or directly serves Lord Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore performance of yajña as it is prescribed in this verse. The varṇāśrama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. "Varṇāśramācāra-vatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān/viṣṇur ārādhyate..." (Viṣṇu Purāṇa 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Any other work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.\n\n**Question 1 : How one can elevate oneself to transcendental loving service of the Lord ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img s3hfdq4jf8351...*\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gxlpcl'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gxlpcl/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_39/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Indian army establishment needs to rethink its strategy regarding China-Pakistan nexus.'<br />Body: 'We need to admit that regardless of their economy, on the western front Pakistan was able to balance the power by bringing in China into the equation. Apart from Bangladesh, never vacating an inch of Indian territories since 1947.\n\nThe current status quo doctrine of Indian military is so far a defensive one. On the western front, somewhere in last three decades a dramatic shift happened on the army to focus on counter insurgency Ops rather than war waging capability. There is no sign the insurgency in Kashmir would end anytime soon.\n\nThis is leading to Indian establishment focus mainly on Pakistan, it’s the China the biggest threat to India not Pakistan. China and Pakistan reaching interoperability because of same equipment, aircraft and electronics etc., The evidence for this is F-16 and MiG dogfight, Pakistanis were able to use Chinese technology to jam the communications from control center.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that China wouldn’t be sharing its superior technology to Pakistan. Indian army establishment needs to rethink its reactive based doctrine. And move away from CI ops rut, the recent appointments of army chiefs is evidence of this where their CI ops credentials were seen as preferred traits. CI ops and small wars are fine, but why does the top army establishment needs to focus on CI ops, at this point army in JK reduced to just glorified police, jk armed police most probably could replace the army with intelligence support. When the shit hits the fan how can the establishment/generals/officers who are experts on counter insurgency can deal with full fledged short term war?\n\nGone are the days where India and China “coexist and grow together “. Immediate need of change of doctrine from reactive to proactive is warranted. India and Australia military agreement yesterday is a good sign, but India needs to enter South China Sea domain as well and build capability for offensive doctrine. Just as China declared “name Indian Ocean doesn’t means India owns the ocean”, “name South China Sea doesn’t mean China owns the sea” international country declared that as well that China doesn’t have sovereignty on the South China Sea like China claims. The fact is South China Sea will be gone once US decides that it’s not worth it. Many countries in the region inviting India to join the region, but so far India refuses to do so in order to not “hurt China sentiments”.\n\nWe should avoid repeat of 1962 episode, we are talking about IBG groups that could take another decade, we don’t wanna wake up one day and read the news that say “China takes control of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh within 6 hours, and both armies are practicing restraint”.\n\nIf you run from a dog, dog would chase and harm you no matter if you are intentions are not start a conflict with the dog. China is the dog in this scenario. No matter how we treat Chinese fair and friendly, for them India is always “potential rival and need to crush them at any cost”.\n\nAnd for god fucking sake, clean up the OFB act first.\n\n[https://karnasena.com/modi-government-should-handle-ordinance-factory-board-with-iron-hammer/](https://karnasena.com/modi-government-should-handle-ordinance-factory-board-with-iron-hammer/)'<br />Author: 'KarnaBro'  id: 'gxbbsf'<br />Score:16<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gxbbsf/indian_army_establishment_needs_to_rethink_its/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Thomas Sowell on India'<br />Body: 'Follows one of many excerpts from Thomas Sowell\'s book "Basic Economics" dealing with India. The book should be made compulsory reading to every politician and student that passes out of our institutions. It will lead an Indian to deep anger at how governments after governments have followed policies that have been devastating for generations of Indians. Book is available for free from known book pdf websites.\n\n&gt;Large numbers of young people with schooling, but without economically meaningful skills, have produced much unemployment in Third World nations. Since the marketplace has little to offer such people that would be commensurate with their expectations, governments have created swollen bureaucracies to hire them, in order to neutralize their potential for political\ndisaffection, civil unrest or insurrection. In turn, these bureaucracies and the voluminous and time-consuming red tape they generate can become obstacles to others who do have the skills and entrepreneur ship needed to contribute to the country\'s economic advancement. In India, for example, two of its leading entrepreneurial families, the Tatas and the Birlas, were repeatedly frustrated in their efforts to obtain the necessary government permission to expand their enterprises: The Tatas made 119 proposals between 1960 and 1989 to start new businesses or expand old ones, and all of them ended up in the wastebaskets of bureaucrats. Aditya Birla, the  young and dynamic inheritor of the Birla empire, who had trained at MIT, was so disillusioned with Indian policy that he decided to expand Birla enterprises outside India, and eventually set up dynamic companies in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, away from the hostile\natmosphere of his home. The vast array of government rules micromanaging businesses "ensured :. that every businessman would break some law or other every month," according to an India executive. Large businesses in India set up their own bureaucracies in Delhi, parallel to those of the\ngovernment, in order to try to keep track of the progress of their applications for the innumerable government permissions required to do things that businesses did on their own in free market economies, and to pay bribes as necessary to secure these permissions. The consequences of suffocating bureaucratic controls in India have been shown not only by such  experiences while they were in full force but also by the country\'s dramatic economic improvements after many of these controls were relaxed or eliminated. The economy\'s growth rate increased dramatically after reforms in 1991 freed many of its entrepreneurs from some of the worst controls, and\nforeign investment in India rose from $150 million to $3 billion.\n\n----\n\nNow is a long overdue chance to make our economy more market oriented instead of providing bailouts after bailouts to sick industries and creating hurdles in the way of businesses.'<br />Author: 'iisdumb'  id: 'gx9ksr'<br />Score:33<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gx9ksr/thomas_sowell_on_india/</li>

The prime svārtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to reach Viṣṇu. The whole institution of varṇa and āśrama is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the śāstras, and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public.A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.7, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ig89n1xq3351.jpg?width=379&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8f284eb9894dd65fb517234cd6425a965aee59\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

There's so many Genuine Issues to Worry about For The Right and Instead We Get Bogged Down as Conspiracy Loonies."<br />Body: 'I see a lot of this, parroting these claims wastes both time and energy and results in credibility loss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Aryan migration did not happen. Firstly who cares if it happened or not, even if it did it happened 5000 years ago, it does not make u less indian cause a lot of your ancestors 5000 years ago came from outside of India. Europeans came to America 300 years ago, are they less American? Is Trump a less American  President cause his great grandfather was German? Also its kind of foolish to deny this in the wake of DNA evidence, which suggests a lot of Indians do have significant common ancestry... Why waste time and energy denying this.\n2. Conspiracy theories on Incidents like Kerala Elephant killing - it made us look less credible as it was likely as elephant ate it without intention. A whole lot of such cases happen.\n3. Chest Beating for stupid stuff, Bharat not India... India is also has sanskrit origins as we called ourselves sindh, from which the ind comes from, anyway who cares its a waste of time. China\'s name comes from sanskrit from cheen. It has little baring on the things that truly matter which I will explain. Again this drains time and energy.\n4. Don\'t make stupid statements in public like Subramanian Swamy does which lowers credibility esp with loads of chest beating. He makes us look like fools and reveals things which shouldn\'t. Like if RSS converted people without making a huge deal about it they would be way more successful. Learn from China, hide your strength don\'t reveal it, China waited 30 years before acting defiantly to world till it was too late for world. Saying sonia gandhi is italian christian is extremely counter productive. She openly converted to hinduism and speaks hindi. By all means criticize her, but criticize her for other things, like her corruption, her promotion of dynasty politics etc. Meanwhile you have snakes like jaggan running around who is an open christian and passing open policies to help christians and conversion... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing I want to add is caste reservation. Huge number of Upper castes posting about how reservation is bad blah blah. Look I get it, but you are being played. As a non-hindu its obvious what is happening, the politicians want to divide the hindu vote so that hindus cannot unite. Caste based reservation is exactly that the upper castes will hate it, the lower castes will never get rid of it. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. Demand the politicans give proper education TO ALL INDIANS. IIT has 20k seats for 20 lakh students, there should be at least 18 lakh seats. Caste reservation will go away on its own if every child has educational opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT POPULATION CONTROL POLICIES. This is literal self suicide. Hindus have lower child sex ratio, which will get worse via pop control... it will speed up muslim majority. Also Islam and Christianity is about to get a huge amount of population via Africa... You know how united muslims are across countries... The only counter is a large hindu population. And no india is not out of resources we are so fertile we can support 3-4 bn population easy. Our farms on avg have 7x less output then western countries, ie we could easily feed 10 bn people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings that matter and right wing should focus on but no one really cares about:\n\n1. Demographic change. It\'s happening very quickly and will only speed up as the sex ratio among hindus has fallen a lot (yes hindus are to blame for it a lot not just muslims having babies). The least the right wing should do is prevent female infanticide of hindus and focus on that. Gujarat the most right leaning state has one of the worst child sex ratios. Those who vote bjp but kill their girl child are the BIGGEST TRAITORS. Muslims meanwhile have sorted out their child sex ratio leading to their inevitable population boom. Furthermore due to infighting we don\'t make a central organization which goes and covertly converts Christians and Muslims. Christians convert via money and education, hindus could easily do same it costs as little as 2000 rs for extremely poor people (including muslims). But instead we would rather focus our time and energy on bharat vs india. I am not hindu myself (but growing up in muslim majority town I am scared of what would happen to india if hindus lost majority), but I see this as complete lunacy. Also there is nothing wrong with converting with money and education as long as no force used and it\'s super effective. Who cares about ram mandir, its a matter of demographics, does anyone really think the ram mandir will survive if muslims become majority. On the contrary if hindus became 95% of the country would anyone even counter protest it? This should be the biggest election thing not ram mandir.\n2. Focus on economy rather than gimmicks. Why the heck is the right wing so blind after Modi. He is destroying india with a super weak economy and putting morons as finance minister. You know how China is able to do what it wants without fear, it actively tortures muslims and Mid east + Pak will not say a word against it. Because they have a strong and big economy. India is literally cucked we can\'t do anything because other countries can easily block us with a fragile and weak economy. Modi has a lower gdp growth than UPA which is saying something because UPA had a coalition and had huge corruption issues. If india was a 15 trillion dollar economy noone would dare try to mess with India\'s internal issues. Defending modi on economy is a dumb dumb idea he has 6 years with majority and has proven fruitless... He\'s clearly a socialist+globalist at heart and cares more about his ego. Farmer loan forgiveness, ayushman bharat etc etc. We need someone who will risk his ego/elections and abolish labor laws+land laws. Someone who will protect consumer goods from external sources, a real 56" chest. That\'s also how to protect India\'s borders big economy. China can do what it wants at border because big economy = big military. Modi can\'t do jack...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy can\'t right wing do this? Why go for self goals and petty wins and make us look like idiots? If we get 95% hindus + strong economy your petty goals will be accomplished on your own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Wake up right wing - Don\'t focus on petty things and conspiracy theories, don\'t divide yourselves, focus on 2 things which matter, economy + demographic change, AND DO NOT KILL YOUR DAUGHTERS RETARDS.

Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of being a yogī, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification, must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful man\'s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord.

      <li>Title::: 'The Calcutta Quran Petition.'<br />Body: 'You need to watch this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gird3CdKLlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gird3CdKLlo) \n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1. No hindu scholars have critically studied islam or christianity despite years of subjugation and ruthless plunder. Few notable exceptions exist, however, they were hounded and silenced. In the last 7 decades two important works have been published: "Understanding Islam through the hadis" (1982) and "Islam, A concept of Political World invasion by Muslims" (2003). Both these works have been banned in India.\n2. Three articles of IPC which muslims and christians abuse to shut down critics: 295A, 153A, 95A. \n3. However tables turned on them when these very acts were invoked to seek a ban on Quran in what is known as the "Calcutta Quran Petition". Himangshu Chakraborty, a refugee from East Bengal, and Chandmal Chopra took this uphill battle against the combined might of the judiciary and government.\n4. As a result of this petition, muslims and their left allies went on rampage all across the indian subcontinent. The state and union governments and the judiciary descended upon the petitioners with full force, smear campaigns were run against them, pakistan dished out sanctimonies and as you might have expected, their voices were successfully snuffed out.\n5. Even after the rejection of writ petition, the jihad continued against Justice Khastgir for even taking up the case in first place. Chopra again filed a review petition which was again straight away dismissed by making a mockery out of law and justice.\n6. The court\'s judgement on the matter had three key points:\n   1. Established quran is the divine word of god.\n   2. Petition consisted of "interpretations" of passages taken "out of context".\n   3. The book is not prejudicial to communal harmony.\n7. Refutations of the court\'s judgement:\n   1.  The justice postulated quran is sacred and no court of india could judge it without citing any relevant law. Anyway, the petition didn\'t even raise this issue of "how muslims hold the quran" rather, "the behavior pattern it inculcated in muslims vis-a-vis non muslims". \n   2. The petition didn\'t contain any interpretations but the literal translation from an orthodox islamic publisher.  The language of quran is neither ambiguous nor allegoric and islamic scholars have always stood for a literal acceptance of the words of quran. \n   3. Also, the judgement didn\'t give even one example of their proper context of verses. However, its true that context is imperative for study of quran and doing so only adds more weight to the arguments raised in petition, making the case against quran stronger.  \n8. She further goes on to give a brief history of islam and jihad and how islamists try to sell false interpretations of jihad and "out of context" verses to present a tolerant picture of islam. Going through the history several things become clear:\n   1. Mohammed created verses to justify his/ his followers\' actions in different situations like killing during holy months, marriage to daughter in law etc.\n   2. Deception and backstabbing of kaffirs is acceptable in islam which was seen during the conquest on mecca and persecution of jews. "Believers are allowed to show friendship with kafirs outwardly but never inwardly".\n   3. There are uncanny parallels with Mohammed\'s jihad and the current situations in India. The cycle of committing violence then claiming victim-hood isn\'t something new in islam.\n9. Even after 700 year long rule of islamic invaders in india, they were not able to repeat their successes in other parts of the world like persia. The reason is stiff resistance from hindus, every  hindu house was armed to teeth and ready to fight. There was no composite culture, only struggle and resistance of hindus. Then Gandhi came along and took the sword from hindus, now disarmed, we are heading towards destruction. \n10. Imams are entitled to call for jihad. While in dar ul islam, this power vests with the ruler, in dar ul harb like India, any qualified muslim can do it. This is the reason we see many instances islamic jihad after their friday prayers, in fact, in many places such friday menace is a norm. Some examples of such jihad are: Moplah riots 1921, direct action day 1946, noakhali holocaust 1947 etc.\n11. In present, every single muslim educated-uneducated, traditionalist-modernist, devout-liberal, believer-atheist is engaged in jihad through their political opinions, causes they take up, humanisms they appeal for, their biases and opinions. Even muslims unaware of the theoretical basis of islam, replicate such behavior, ideas and tendencies absorbed through observation and affiliation.'<br />Author: 'AuthenticGoo'  id: 'gwgbn8'<br />Score:56<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gwgbn8/the_calcutta_quran_petition/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Should India be named after Indus, Is Bharat a better name? by Balaji Viswanathan'<br />Body: 'Indus is an important river system for North India even today. By the Indus Waters Treaty\nnearly half the river belongs to India. A large chunk of Punjab is fed by its tributaries. Thus, India can legitimately use the name of Indus.\n\nIf India cannot be named after Indus, why cannot the same logic be used against King Bharata? After all, he was not the only great king of India and we don\'t even have historical evidence to his reign. He was neither a character in Ramayana or Mahabharata. He was not a Rig Vedic god. In what way naming after him will make ours more Indian that what are now. Indonesia doesn\'t even have the Indus river running, but still stick to the name because of its significance.\n\nWhy Indus make a much better sense for India\'s name?\n\n    The root word from India comes from the Sanskrit word Sindhu that was modified a bit by the Persians to become Hindh and later stylized by the Greeks to become India. It is thus a nexus of 3 great civilizations. That aptly reflects Indian culture too. The core is the Sanskruti, enhanced by the Persian interactions and later built on by the Europeans. Like it or not, we are a mix of all 3.\n    Indus is where the greatest of Indian civilization rose. Whether you are left or right, "Aryan" or "Dravidian" fact is no Indian group disagrees that Indus Valley Civilization is the iconic age for India.\n    Indus acts as the westernmost boundary for the Indian culture. For thousands of years, the river protected India from external threats. Like the Himalayas it acts as the wall of India, mightily protecting the culture. Persians called us Hindus because the people on the eastern side of the Indus had been evolving a distinct culture. This distinction continues to this day - marking the rough borders between West and South Asia.\n    It is the banks of Indus, did our ancients create Universities such as Takshashila where some of the greatest Indians like Chanakya, Panini and Charaka taught 2300 years ago.\n    India is the name Greeks glorified in works like Arrian\'s Indica. India was the country Columbus claimed he was sailing to. India was the root word for Indonesia, our cultural sibling. India is the only country with an ocean named after it. The word India has superior historical importance and symbolism. This is why Jinnah hoped so much that post-1947 India would call herself Hindustan and not India [Pakistani media still continues to call us by that name].\n\nIf the nation drops India as an official name, the country that would first congratulate is Pakistan. They don\'t like India taking up most of the history of the subcontinent and would not mind taking up the legacy of Indus river &amp; the civilization for itself. India would no longer be the name that pops up when you mention Indian Ocean or Indian Subcontinent. The ghost of Winston Churchill who claimed India as a mere geography and not a nation would also be happy. They would all send flowers to the dumb Indians who help achieve that. These dumb folks don\'t know the brand India carries.\n\nI have nothing against the name Bharath, but this ill-informed attack on the name India must stop. I find it even more shameful that it is the so called nationalists who spread such crap. Both of India\'s official names are beautiful and ancient. However, I would more proudly use the name Indian because that reflects our nation\'s history better.'<br />Author: 'indra_sword_rises'  id: 'gw8jko'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gw8jko/should_india_be_named_after_indus_is_bharat_a/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Religion or Regime? Who/What is at fault ?'<br />Body: 'I’m all for taking the BLM movement closer to home, a lot closer to home &amp; standing up for systemic oppression in India. Systemic oppression &amp; police brutality exist here, and have existed for the longest time - We have given far too much of the country’s power to far too little individuals to hold, and the result is the conflict &amp; chaos we see every other day. \n\nHowever, let’s get one thing straight; there is a MAJOR difference in how minorities are treated here, in India &amp; how they’re treated in the States. \n\nMinorities get absolute freedom to run educational institutions due to Article 30(1) of our constitution and few other sections. It is an undisputed fact that education is the key to social and economic progress of an individual or community. And unfettered rights to establish and administer educational institutions of choice is an extra ordinary instrument available ONLY to minorities to control social and economic development of not just their own group (religion) but those of others as well. \n\nThis comes in stark contrast to how Black people are treated in the States, they have no benefits or exclusive rights - not even on paper - there is open discrimination against them. \n\nAgain, I’m not saying there isn’t any in India - there is - however, unlike in the States, this discrimination doesn’t come from India’s majority population. It comes from systemic failure, from appeasement politics &amp; from logistically unfavourable decisions in the country’s past (*cough* Partition *cough*). \n\nSo, if you want to rush and equate BLM with the Jamia movement and the Delhi pogrom, be my guest. But, if you have the good sense to look closer, you’ll realise that the majority is no better off - for starters, they don’t get a Hajj subsidy, they don’t get to have a fellowship to their name or receive any special treatment from certain political parties. \n\nThe divide exists, and it’s unfair - and yes, it shouldn’t exist. But, unlike in the States, where white people continue to actively oppress others on a daily basis, the majority here does nothing of the sort. \n\nIt simply witnesses other parties like the INC go out &amp; brand acts like 26/11 saffron terrorism, to benefit from minority vote banks in the name of secularism &amp; appeasement politics. \n\nSo, if you’re going to talk about the oppression here, have the good sense to look at both sides of the coin. No one is saying that minorities aren’t being hurt, and no one is saying that their lives don’t matter. And God forbid anyone here says all lives matter, because that is just “plain intolerance”. \n\nAll I’m saying is maybe in India, the fight does not have to be minority v/s majority. It has to be anti-establishment - it has to be against the perpetrators of this chaos and conflict, it has to be against people in positions of power - because if you sit down and segregate who is more at fault, and which community deserves help first, you are benefitting no one except the minds at play here - you’re adding fuel to the fire of religious conflict, and this same flame keeps these big names warm, as you &amp; I continue to suffer in the duel of the castes. \n\nJust because things look similar on a surface level, doesn’t mean they really are. So many atrocities committed against Hindus go unchecked, while the Far Leftist wings harp on about crimes against minorities. \n\nLet’s take our judgement, analysis and prerogative to voice our opinions in our OWN hands. \n\n#ProtestRegimesNotReligion'<br />Author: 'IQofACarrot'  id: 'gvp8j6'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gvp8j6/religion_or_regime_whowhat_is_at_fault/</li>

For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of being a yogī, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification, must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful man's knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord.

The station\'s empty, but the authorities have absolutely no idea what\'s going on. \n\nUpon entering, three guys in military uniform lying down on benches at the entrance asked us to climb the east west station bridge and inquire about the train\'s status with the personnel there. So we go up, and two men sitting at a table in the middle of the bridge give us blank faces when we say the name of the train. They have a list in front of them but nowhere does it say Nethravati. So they ask us to go to the opposite end, down to the station master\'s cabin. \n\nWe go there and the station master basically scolds us for coming to his office. He says go wait on the bridge, so we climb back up, find empty benches on the bridge and go wait there. In 5 mins a very VERY rude cop comes and says to my father, "What the hell are you doing here, looks like you\'ve brought your entire family to the station." I explained to him were here to pick up my mother (58) who\'s coming back with 2 heavy suitcases, and he literally shoves us away from there. I tell him we don\'t mind doing what we\'re told if there\'s some consistency in protocol, but there\'s none. Anyway, we come back down again and wait, and in 10 mins the train starts pulling up to the platform so we go back up again.\n\nThis same cop sees us and another senior citizen (also receiving someone), walks towards us and starts to hurl abuses at us and pushes us away. Including my father whom he catches by the collar. The other senior citizen also asks the cop very gently why he is behaving so aggressively without provocation, and the cop pushes him as well. Basically behaving drunk on power. \n\nAt this point I lose it and take out my phone to start recording him behaving this way. This provokes him even more, and he pushes me hard and swats the cell phone out of my hands. At this point I stop recording.  \n\nTwo cops then start to shove me saying, "Come to the police station, we\'ll show you." My father knows a senior cop in Mumbai police, whom he immediately calls. In about 5 minutes the aggressive cop and his partner take me aside. Their tone suddenly changes. Now they want to know what I am going to do with the video. The partner asks me to reason with him, and says tempers are fraying and cops have it especially hard. I say I have no issues with following orders, but THERE JUST AREN\'T ANY and we\'re being sent around the station without any clear indication of what to do. And if that isn\'t enough, an extremely rude cop to treat us like absolute scum for NO BLOODY REASON. \n\nBy then my mom comes up with those two bags and there is a rush of passengers on the bridge whom they have to immediately thermal check, so they let us off. But man, my dad\'s deeply traumatised by this, he hasn\'t been able to stop talking about it. \n\nI\'m totally down with following well thought through orders given by the govt. But brutality and shit talking I will not take lying down. \n\nPART 2 will be the video itself. \n\nPS: what can I do to ensure cops don\'t treat civilians like this during the rest of the lockdown?

It\'s mentioned in the Vedas, the Puranas, the Samhitas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and is still in continuous usage. Vedas are known to have been composed circa 1700 BC, during the initial stages of the Vedic period.\n\nCertain people seem to have issues with using the word "Bharata" and seem to be more comfortable using the word "India", coined by the Greek in/around 300 BC, which basically makes "Bharata" close to 1500 years older than "India".'<br />Author: 'aszora'  id: 'gv3trh'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gv3trh/why_are_some_people_against_the_word_bharata_its/</li>

Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the śāstras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam affirms this:\n\ntyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer\n\nbhajann apakvo \'tha patet tato yadi\n\nyatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ\n\nko vārtha āpto \'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.\n\n"If someone takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the śāstras nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the śāstras, what does it avail him if he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious?" (Bhāg. 1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, sannyāsa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.\n\n**Question 1 : Why one should follow the prescribed duties enjoined in the śāstras ? What is the ultimate goal of following such duties ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5whqb8usf251.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272a66f896842dfc41a3976b4297695d5effef61\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gv1o3o'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gv1o3o/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is35/</li>

I wanted to make it in a story format.\n\naround 80-90 students, 10-15 lecturers. Want to include them all. Don\'t know how.\n\n**Here\'s what I thought-**\n\nAfter the lock-down was started, most of the people went home, North, South, East, West. . I want your help and suggestion to do it -\n\n* Guy from south, watching a movie, bored. In bed. Gets a call, from another guy(from South India), they ask what\'s up, say they are bored. One asks the other, have you started studying/thinking about jobs? First guy says "what rubbish", or something like that. Then they start to call a third guy.\n* Third guy is already making tons of money, and he\'s on a call with his best friend/business partner who\'s also making tons of money. Both are my classmates. They get a call from the original 2, who ask whats up. They say all usual, just boring. They reminisce about the 4 years of college.\n\nThat\'s all I thought till now. I want to include videos from people who are willing to make videos from their homes, and I want to compile it, use photos. I want to include some animation kind of thing- kind of like in Travel vlogs and channels there\'s a map of the country who travels from one place to another and a red line traces it. Also I want to add teachers\' bit. \n\nBut I don\'t know how to do that.

Which of them is better and Why ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "Sāṅkhya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter."\n\n"The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse-that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on Kṛṣṇa), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is Kṛṣṇa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gītā. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of these two, the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.3, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8gzbyqxqb251.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c1236289af00783b3b2bb948e5c4332659df0fc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

It's surprising that how the Left starts supporting rioting at the same time when a country wants to pay back their enemy. We've seen something similar in CAA riots. India was increasing pressure on Pakistan and to dilute it, Leftists started rioting over a non-existent issue. An artist I was following on Instagram posted that if any of her followers voted or are going to vote for Trump, they should immediately unfollow her. I was like...is this the freedom of expression and democracy in the supposedly strongest democratic nation of the month. The role of artists is highly suspicious in these cases. In our country, artists like Pratik Kuhad and Ankur Tewari who enjoy a good urban following went to Shaheen Bagh to support the protestors. \n\nI strongly feel that Chinese lobby is behind the instability in America so that the government couldn't focus on the unspoken war against China?

Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sannyāsa). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sannyāsa, or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as Nārāyaṇa. But Lord Kṛṣṇa does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, sannyāsa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga). Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt. Even a slight performance of such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.\n\n  \n**Question 1 : What qualification is needed to adopt the fourth order of life - sannyāsa ?**\n\n  \n**Question 2 : FITB : if someone takes \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7qqwean58251.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9edc585d34b2e1a0c2ab22fad5b07c36c32ebc89\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gudq3e'<br />Score:4<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gudq3e/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_34/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Komaram Bheem - The Stalwart of Tribals, Inspiration to all'<br />Body: "#  “Jal Jangal Zameen”\n\nA slogan that is still used by the Tribal community of India today, a slogan that encapsulates the struggle of every Adivasi faces to this day. But many have forgotten who give this slogan. The slogan that became the voice of many, during not only during the Freedom struggle but also remains the voice till date. **This slogan was given by none other than Komaram Bheem.**\n\nMany or let’s say most people who live outside of Andhra and Telangana remain unknown to a personality that shook the rule of Nizams in Hyderabad. Perhaps if he had accepted the offers made by Nizam he would have been remembered more fondly in our History books like many others. But the path to one’s Dharma is a hard one and Komaram Bheem chose the path that many would have taken the easy way out of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Background\n\nIn the year 1900, Komaram Bheem was born in the Gond tribe (Koitur) in Asifabad district (now in) Telangana. **This area used to be part of Gond Kingdom of Chanda but now like many areas of Telangana at the time it was under the rule of Nizam of Hyderabad.** The Nizams during the period were under the British Government. Komaram Bheem Ji had never stepped out of the tribal area in his childhood and did not attain any formal education.\n\nNizam government were never sympathetic to the Tribals nor were they just. They used to take the resources and crops that belonged to the Gonds and made tribes pay excessive taxation.\n\nMypathi Arun Kumar in his book narrates, *“Bheem grew up listening to stories of exploitation of Gond and Kolam Adivasis by Janglaat Police, businessmen, and zamindars. Crops produced after Podu farming were taken away by Nizam officials. They’d cut fingers of Adivasi children, accusing them of illegally cutting down trees. Taxes were collected forcefully, otherwise false cases were registered.”*\n\nAt the mere age of fifteen years, **Sri Komaram Bheem witnessed the death of his father for raising voice for Tribal issues and rights.** His father was killed by a Forest police officer, who served the Nizam. Although his family moved from Sankepalli to Sardapur after the death of his father, one could imagine how the young Bheem would have felt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Rise of the revolutionary\n\nIn his adulthood, he saw many atrocities committed by Nizam against the people of Telangana. On one day Patwari Laxmi Rao and Pattadar Siddique came to his Village to seek taxes for the crops harvested by the Gonds. They came with ten men under the banner of m and started harassing the villagers to pay the Taxes. They even took the Land of Komram Bheem. The Gonds with Komaram Bheem tired of giving up the majority of their harvest to the Nizams who would not even compensate them, took their land and never treat them right were fed up. A tussle broke between the Gonds and the Nizam’s men. **During this tussle, Sri Komaram Bheem killed the Pattadar Siddique.**\n\nKomaram Ji and his friend Kondl escaped from the village. A local printing press owner Vitoba helped them flee and gave the refuge with him. During his stay with Vitoba, **Sri Komaram Bheem Ji learnt English and Hindi**. The printing press owner Vitoba used to run a magazine against the atrocities committed by Britishers and Nizams. But soon thereafter the Vitoba was arrested by Police and his press was closed. Sri Komaram Bheem then went to Assam, during his four and half a year stay in Assam he worked in the tea plantation and fought for the workers right there for which he was even arrested. He broke out of jail after just four days. **During his stay in Assam, he also heard about Alluri Sita Ramaraju, a brave freedom fighter who was leading the charge against the British for Tribal rights. Sri Komaram Bheem Ji also remembered the Ramji Gond, a man who had fought against the Nizam.** Determined to fight for the Tribal rights Sri Bheem headed back to Telangana.\n\nAfter his return Komaram Bheem Ji he moved to Kakanghat with his mother and brother Somu. There he got married to Som Bai. He also helped the Village head Lacchu Patel to settle the land dispute. This incident made him quite popular among the Tribal Villages. Sri Komaram went to meet the Nizam and put an end to the atrocities against the Tribes but the Nizam refused to meet him. Sri Komram Bheem Ji lost the hope for a peaceful solution and returned home. He then realized that the only solution to the atrocities faced by the tribes was the armed revolution against the Nizam.\n\nHe inspired many and was able to mobilise Adivasi youth and common people from twelve Villages – Jodeghat, Patnapur, Bhabejhari, Tokennavada, Chalbaridi, Shivaguda, Bhimangundi, Kallegaon, Ankusapur, Narsapur, Koshaguda, Linepatter; and formed an army to protect the Gond's right. **He wanted a separate kingdom independent of Muslim Nizam rule.**\n\nThe revolt started with the Komaram Bheem attacking the local landlords who for years had taken the fruits of Gond labour and hard work. When Nizam heard about the news of Tribal uprising, they were frightened; at first, **they decided to suppress the revolt but were unable to.** Even with all their army might they were unable to do so. **Nizams then decided to use greed and offered Sri Komran Bheem Ji land in exchange for stopping the revolt; Sri Komaram Bheem Ji refused the offer** and continued his fight against the Nizam government. Sri Komram Bheem Ji had two demands, first, the people that were falsely accused and arrested by British and Nizam will have to be released, and second that the Gonds would be given a separate kingdom to rule independent of British rule.\n\nBoth demands were disagreed upon and military action was taken against the Revolt. Nizams tried to end the revolt with their many battles against the Gonds and even asked for Britisher’s help but Sri Komaram Bheem’s army continued to fight against the Nizams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Betrayal and Martyrdom\n\nDuring this time the Tribals became more and more inspired by Bheem Ji. **Sri Bheem coined the slogan of “Jal, Jangal, Zameen”, the words inspired them to continue to fight against the injustice.** With their many battles came many failures and the Nizam and Britishers realized they could not capture Sri Komaram Bheem Ji, they decided to conspire to kill Bheem Ji to put an end to the revolt. **Nizam govt. bribed Kurdu Patel to become an informant of Nizam. As a result, he sold out the location and information of Bheem Ji.**\n\nIn September of 1940, nearly three years since the revolt had started by Sri Komram Bheem Ji, Nizam’s talukdar of the Asifabad area **Abdul Sattar with Police surrounded the Komaram Bheem and his men who were camping in Jodhegat. Abdul Sattar asked them to surrender, even though Komaram Bheem Ji had no weapons to speak of they refused to surrender to Nizam government.** Upon the third refusal to surrender Abdul Sattar ordered the police to open fire on the rebels. The Gond warriors attacked the enemies with axes, bows and arrows. Some sources say the battle went for three days but in the end, the enemy forces and betrayal of own kin proved too much. In that struggle along with Sri Komaram Bheem Ji fifteen of his men attained martyrdom. Fearing that the rebel leader knew magic, the Talukdar Abdul shot the body of Komaram Bheem until the body was unrecognizable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Legacy of the hero of India\n\nNot many books show very and courage of the stalwart of Gonds but the people of Andhra and Telangana still remember the man who inspired many with his words and actions. The Gond tribal fight continued after the death of Sri Komaram Bheem Ji. **The place of his birth Asifabad was renamed to Komaram Bheem district.** A statue of Sri Komaram Bheem Ji was also unveiled in 2012.\n\nThe Gond community regards Sri Komaram Bheem Ji to be no less than a deity. Gonds observe Bheem’s death anniversary every year on Aswayuja Powrnami, where an event is organized at Jodeghat to commemorate his life and struggle of the great warrior.\n\n**The dispute regarding Hindutva**\n\nMany people like to make statements that the Komaram Bheem was not a Hindu leader this is false. Although his fight was for the rights of Tribals more than anything else. However, to disassociate, the Community of Tribals from Sanatana Dharma is wrong on many levels.\n\nAlthough the customs of many Gond tribes are very different from many traditions that are considered *“mainstream Hinduism”* but Santana Dharma has no value as such of rigid traditions. Many Gond communities believe in worshipping ancestors which is also prevalent in many areas of Hinduism. They worship the land and nature which is also part of Hinduism.\n\n**Many Gonds worship Ravana, whom they consider to be the tenth** ***dharmaguru*** **of their people and the ancestor-king of one of their four lineages.** They also worship Kupar Lingo as their supreme deity and their ancestor before Ravana. On Dussehra, the Gondi inhabitants of Paraswadi carry an image of Ravana riding an elephant in a procession to worship him and protest the burning of Ravana's effigies. The Rani Durgavati was also a Gond Queen.\n\n*P.S - If you find any factual mistake in the above article please feel free to correct. Follow our subreddit HindutvaRises for more.

      <li>Title::: 'The Great Indian Summer'<br />Body: ' The fresh kite flying winds of spring and Dahlia flowers are over. It is only dawn now but the puffs of occasional heat in the breeze sound an unmissable warning of the afternoon to come. The sky has been relentlessly cloud-free for as long as you can remember. The golden dust of summer hangs over the world, silent and ominous.\n\nThe marigolds wither, the zinnias are dying, plants turn ashen grey as the sun hardens. The birds are starting to disappear. Dogs are dazed and exhausted, their tongues lolling. The ground is starting to crack, rivers run dry.\n\nThe great summer sweeps through India — a summer of beaten gold light and loo winds. Those bundles up there in the sky are dust, not rain, clouds. The whole world turns from the green of the grass and trees, and white of the houses and blue of the sky to one dull, hot yellow fog.\n\nYour feet try to soak up the last remaining coolness of last night from the corners of the cement floor. Switch off the fans! There is a dry molten loo pouring off their blades, impossible to bear. Bring out the *khus* mats and run water through their mats.\n\nThere is just nothing to do but a long afternoon siesta.\n\nThe afternoon mounts hour by the hour. Rivers of thermals course up through the air, but no birds ride them, the animals are silent and waiting. No whisper as the heat rises and rises to a silent drumbeat, building into an unimaginable fury that is the mid-summer afternoon.\n\nThe Earth travels millions of miles through space closer to the Sun. Pounding heat emanates out of every corner into a one pulsing heat stew. All of the prejudices and passions and silly little concerns of the world are on hold, all immaterial and meaningless until this heat subsides.\n\nIt is impossible to be in the sun for more than a few seconds. Everyone is hiding, the world is empty. A great premonition sweeps over all creatures, big and small, they have nothing but the nearest shade on their minds. The sun is a knife dangling over you; the wind slowly grows into a furnace, melting and flattening all of existence into a searing fever dream.\n\nThe world is burning, but there is no wind, no rustle of leaves. Everything is eerily silent here on the edge of ten million years. It is empty as a street at hot high noon.\n\nAnd still the temperature climbs…\n\nSleep would be a gift.\n\nThe power goes out…\n\nShhh..! Someone, something turns into the burning street. Hard to see now, but then … a boy of 11, a scrap buyer — of old newspapers and magazines, with his familiar call. No one answers, no one opens their door. The boy is closer now, you can see it all now. He has no footwear. He is dancing on the molten asphalt, one foot on the road, then off, then the other. Hopping like a desert lizard, so his feet don’t get burned. A large basket full of old newspapers and comics and magazines shades his head. A ghost walking alone in the empty town.\n\nHighways stretch away from the town shrinking into tiny ribbons on the horizon, empty and silent. Mirages hang over the landscape like illusions of all things not important that fill our not real lives. You awaken from the rest of your senses to the heat, it is intolerable, a whiteout of molten torrid fever.\n\nThere is just nothing to do in the void of the day but slip in and out of long afternoon siestas.\n\nThen, without so much as a sound, the cycle reaches its peak, and starts to turn downhill. The Earth returns to its orbit. The sun climbs down, then dips over the horizon. The power comes back.\n\nOpen the doors at last! Bring out the water hoses! Lay them on the scorched earth! Spray the Jasmine and the *Rajnigandha*! Run around, swing and play, time to get hosed!\n\nIt is almost dusk. The earth will come back to sanity for a few hours. Things will be clearer in the dark than in the white light. Summer nights, the demon of heat are in hiding.\n\nAt night the jasmine will bloom. The jasmine is the guardian of the silence of summer nights.\n\nThe weeks will stretch on and on. The yellow flowers of the mango trees will bloom into small hard green mangoes, then they will ripen into the juicy softness of heavenly nectar. Mangoes, melons and *lychees*, sweet *bael* sherbet and *lassi*.\n\nThe distant thunder of the monsoon rains are far, far away, thousands of miles over the Indian ocean somewhere, carrying a million years of water and mist.'<br />Author: 'pras'  id: 'gu1k24'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gu1k24/the_great_indian_summer/</li>

This was the case especially in the  Middle Eastern countries and European countries.\n\nBut when it comes to India even to this date religion it's teachings, practices, beliefs and customs are being made fun of, ignored, criticised and ridiculed. I'll confess that I too was doing the same when someone spoke about or practiced their religion.\n\nBut I then tried to look at things differently with a historic perspective. Then I asked myself how did people those days survive without technology the many hardships of life like hunger, thirst ,drought, flood, invasions, conversions, death, torture, poverty, disease etc. Then I thought for some time and realised that people saw their respective Gods as a symbol of hope where they prayed to something that gave them hope to live, hope that things will get better, hope that pain and suffering will end and hope that life is gonna be good. \n\nWe have technology today that gives us hope and pleasure that our future is safe and sound but people those days used religion to keep themselves going inspite of the hardships that nature, people or anything that was in their way while they were moving forward to continue their lives and preserve their race[.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRUId56XUPqedTFSEetYyONcxnyhgqLFNxsGXidScxwiPAa_SS01eU-owde&amp;s=10)"<br />Author: 'bennychetan98'  id: 'gtsiw2'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtsiw2/if_you_hate_religion_read_this_piece_you_may/</li>

In simple words when we crush leaf or root of ashwagandha, it\xa0smells like horse. The herb is also called\xa0Indian ginseng or winter cherry.\xa0Roots\xa0and\xa0leaves\xa0of ashwagandha is used as medicine.\n\n\nAshwagandha has different names in different languages such as in\xa0Hindi(Asgandha, Asgandh, Ashwagandha),\xa0Telugu(Penneru Gadda, Dommadolu Gadda),\xa0\xa0Tamil\xa0(Amukura, Askulang),\xa0Malayalam(Amukkura),\xa0\xa0Marathi(Asandh, Doragunj),\xa0\xa0Gujarathi(Aasandha, Ghoda Aakun),\xa0\xa0Bengali(Asvagandha),\xa0\xa0Kannada(Ashvagandhi)\n\n\n\nAshwagandha and coronavirus\n\n\nNatural compounds from Ashwagandha have emerged as a\xa0potential drug against Covid-19. It is revealed in a collaborative study of DAILAB at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan.\n\n\nThe researchers targeted the main\xa0SARS-CoV-2 enzyme for splitting proteins, known as the Main protease (Mpro). Mpro plays a key role in replication of the virus. The researchers have discovered that a chemical Withanone (Wi-N) – C28H38O6, derived from Ashwagandha and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE), an active ingredient of New Zealand Propolis, has the potential to block the activity of Mpro. Withanone also potentially blocks the entry of virus through the cell membrane.\n\n\n•\xa0Withanone is a steroidal lactone, present in the roots of Ashwagandha.

There are fairly distinct ethnic lines with solid histories of kingdoms of peoples and not the fiefs of warlords. \n\nOr did Delhi and Mughal rule obliterate any sense of proto-nationalist antagonism in United Provinces on down and it was just every Hindu has to work together to survive Muslim rule?"<br />Author: 'Sansophia'  id: 'gtr7pe'<br />Score:0<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtr7pe/possible_nations_in_inia_is_the_pan_indian_idea/</li>

The first 2 months, Mar &amp; April, the epidemic remained contained to the megacities. However, the lockdown &amp; quarantine was followed by many groups in these megacities, people hid, refused to get screened or quarantined or tested, refused to follow lockdown.  \n\nResult: the epidemic spread widely in these cities and in many areas, reached the stage of community transmission. But now the migrants from the se cities are going back, going back to their villages &amp; towns in lakhs, within state &amp; intrastate. Again obvious that they couldn't be held unemployed for more than 2 months. The ideal case would be if the megacities followed the quarantine strictly, people punished for violating quarantine/lockdown &amp; the megacities defeat the virus. But that didn't happen, either because appeasement or rule of the gundas or whatever. \n\nConsequence: Now the numbers of cases that we see are not confined to the cities, these new cases are coming from the towns and villages, where there is very limited medical infrastructure to support the epidemic. It is not that  these towns are very less conjusted compared to the cities &amp; will be more successful than the cities in imposing quarantine on the new arrivals.

The guidelines will come into effect from June 1 and will be effective till June 30.\n\nThe current phase of re-opening, 'Unlock 1', will have an economic focus.\n\nAll activities\xa0that were prohibited earlier will be opened up in areas outside containment zones in a\xa0phased manner, with the stipulation of following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to be prescribed by the Health Ministry.\n\nIn\xa0Phase I,\xa0religious places and places of worship for public,\xa0hotels, restaurants,\xa0other hospitality services, and\xa0shopping malls\xa0will be\xa0permitted to open\xa0from\xa0June 8.

      <li>Title::: '[OC] [Random] take on Ladakh LAC situation'<br />Body: 'Lots of people are talking about Ladakh LAC. Here is my unsolicited take on it.\n\n\\[Disclaimer: Reader must understand these are gross oversimplifications of the scenario. There many many factors known unknown out there. These are just few points as I see it this weekend.\\]\n\nUnlike most ‘reports’ out there, LAC skirmish is IMO is NOT about Taiwan, or WHO or BRO’s progress or manufacturing competition. It is more about India’s recent overtures towards retaking POK Gilgit-Baltistan. \n\nLet’s look at it this way:\n\nIndia, I guess, would have been sufficiently interested and had the international’s opinion tail-wind (after the repeal of 370) to go ahead and do something with POK situation. Ideally given the terrain, it would have this summer season to do something about it. \n\nMind you, the following ‘assumptions’ are if Pakistan does not play hard and IMO it is unlikely to do much enough to stall.\n\nSo by the end of Sep all activities related to the takeover, consolidate, establish and safeguard must be completed by Sep, moving into Oct with buffer. (This is important because you don’t want the forces to be isolated or under attack during the winter when the movement from mainland would be harder.) Or, with a very busy winter. \n\nMy guess (a complete out of the hat number), is that it would ideally take about 30-50 days to complete such transition on the ground level. That would leave us with takeover date around mid-July to Aug. So basically, you should see a movement in June/July, if it happens.\n\nNow, China is a muddying factor. This takeover would give China ‘enough’ pretext to raise the costs for India. The build up of forces on the opposite LAC is precisely how you achieve such an objective, and building a small show-case contingent of aircrafts. This is just like Russian subs in 1972, it causes enough disruptions in calculations that your calendar goes over-date and can consequently affect the go/no-go of the mission.\n\nWhy would China do this for Ladakh territory in the present global circumstances where it has hugely lot more to lose than gain from few kms the territory? It doesn’t make sense unless you bring POK into picture.\n\nSo here we go, just remember the disclaimer:\n\n1. Indian ocean theatre is highly unlikely to be activated. If any activation i.e. any ships in the threatening distance of India in Bay or Indian ocean, would lead to an escalation against “India”, and not just Ladakh territory. This is a huge magnification which I am absolutely sure is not in the best interests of China.\n\n1.A. This would lead to rallying of allies on either side and you don’t need that now.\n\n1.B. It will mean that US’s plan for Indo-Pacific Treaty Organization, similar to NATO will make huge sense for lots of members, complicating the life immensely for China and its aggressive SCS plans.\n\n1.C. The economic costs for China would be huge, especially coming on back of Coronavirus debacle. Sanctions will take its toll.\n\n1.D. US, Aussies and India will have enough pretext to cut-off Malaca for good, and highly militarize already established presence there.\n\n1.E But, Pakistan can open other theaters - symmetric and asymmetric\n\nBasically, China doesn’t need this. So the theatre would be compartmentalized in North. With even East unlikely to be activated in any full-blown manner. That is not to say, there won’t / couldn’t be skirmishes along the entire LAC to add pressure and create distractions.\n\n2. If you looking for more reasons than friendship with Pak, this is the test for China’s BRI and its commitments.\n\n2.A. Pak and especially Gilgit-Baltistan falls under the BRI, and this is the moment for China to show it “means it”\n\n2.B. World is too keenly watching this for sure. Why?\n\n2.B.A World needs to know if BRI is a ‘defense treaty’\n\n2.B.B While marketed as ‘economic assistance’ and usage for ‘defense / offense’ will raise red flags everywhere including Europe. (Sri Lanka, looking at you.) Backlash on the BRI countries and the scheme’s existence will be in danger\n\n2.B.C World, including Russia, will come up with an alternative to BRI, Blue Dot program is a start. (Don’t forget BRI almost covers the entire southern border of Russia)\n\nDoes China need its investments blacklisted everywhere or create a formidable competition all for few kms of Ladakh LAC? Don’t think so.\n\n3. CoronaVirus has put China on backfoot, especially diplomatically and economically.\n\n3.A. They really don’t need something they can’t handle right now\n\n3.B US is breathing hard, and the first HUGE move is the repeal of the Hong Kong trade agreement. (People will write books on this moment. Watch it.)\n\n3.C But for US, repeal of HK treaty means nothing. It is HUUUGGE… FOR China, not US.\n\n3.D US went into an unending war spending $8 trillion on an event that was triggered by killing of its 2500 citizens. How much is the willful danger (if not, directly responsible) to 100,000 US deaths and counting?\n\n3.E US’ response to China, will be of different nature. China is not Iraq. \n\n4. This moment is also a check on India’s resolve and guts to take on China, not just diplomatically but if need be, on the ground with bullets flying about. This not 1962. Far from it.\n\n4.A India’s response will define how the skrimishes in other parts of LAC will be handled.\n\n4.B China will want to know how India will respond, and does putting forces near your border matter\n\n4.C And, if India responds strongly, does China equally respond back? And by how much? \n\n4.D Or, will India call China’s bluff? Japan, Vietnam and others, will keenly watch this space.\n\n5. The problem with China interfering in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) takeover is that for India, it can play a long game.\n\n5.A India can postpone the event to next year, or year after that.\n\n5.B So basically, Ladakh LAC event could become a yearly summer affair much like Wagah border is daily affair.\n\n5.C But India does lose its advantages (possibly) if it stretches too many years, and Chinese are able to dig out of their diplomatic debacle\n\n5.D Alternatively, pushing it to next year could increase India’s lever as the full brunt of the Coronavirus repercussions/ sanctions would be in effect\n\n5.E China dragging on this to yearly affair will embolden Japan, Vietnam also to call their bluffs in SCS\n\n5.F I would give long-game probability as low\n\n6. China’s decision to insert itself into the POK conflict, will overall hurt China and not help it\n\n6.A India can still take the costs, bear it, including conflict with Pak, and take it but would such endeavor be worthwhile?\n\n6.B Or, does it mean that we can’t do it in 2020\n\n6.C Or, does India use other options.\n\nAll this does some assumptions:\n\n1. The allies will be onboard with India in the takeover of POK, and there are no signs they will not be there with us. Pak has only China ATM.\n\n2. India will not be hit with any sanctions, which could derail economic opportunities in post-virus world\n\n3. Most allied involvement is likely to be symbolic, aka talk, as they try recover from the virus impact\n\n4. US is unlikely to commit as it heads to elections\n\n5. As long as other theaters don’t open, ‘talk’ should be enough\n\n6. Meanwhile, China has to damage-control HK’s treaty repeal. \n\n7. International boldness on Taiwan will shift dramatically\n\n8. For longer term, Blue Dot and Indo-Pacific Treaty are highly likely\n\n9. Basically, India and China both have big problems ATM. Do they want to create problems for each other?\n\n10. Not accounting here for Pak’s aggression and forces\n\n11. All said and done, basic framework is China does not want escalation. This may be wrong.\n\nFor India:\n\nIt has costs, but it also has opportunities. Fortune comes to the brave. Is India brave enough? Can it fight, Coronavirus, Recession, need to grow, and take on bigger risk simultaneously. (As an aside, Thank God, the right team to do is in place. They will decide what’s the best.)\n\nIndia is on cusp of lots of benefits. Few here: \n\n1. Increased acceptance as a military power and ally\n\n1.A If India does play to win against China, Pak combo, it will become, along with Russia and Japan, one of the key pieces to contain China’s behavior\n\n2. Economics: Investments, growth, demographics, \n\n3.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 3.1'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : "Arjuna said: O Janardana, O Kesava, why do you urge me to engage in this ghastly warfare, if you think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?" Why Arjuna is asking this question to Kṛṣṇa ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Sometimes Kṛṣṇa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But without being trained in the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using Kṛṣṇa consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned Kṛṣṇa as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord Kṛṣṇa elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in this Third Chapter."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 3.1, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kubqgmk0uw151.jpg?width=340&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1d6e79c0d3e98753353a53580be5a5379b4c92\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: 'The Murder of Gurudev Shri Shanti Kali Ji'<br />Body: 'It   has been more than a month since the Palghar Mob lynching of the   Sadhus. But the news of Church-sponsored terrorism against Hindus is not   new. **Many Sadhus have been   killed by Christian terrorists either for raising voice against illegal   Cows slaughter, Conversions in Villages, or even just teaching the   values of Sanatan Dharma in Christian areas.**\n\nOne of these incidents of terrorism is the act of Christian terrorists murdering Sri Shanti Kali.\n\nSri   Shanti Kali was born to Shri Dhananjay Tripura and Smt Khanjan Devi in  a  small village south Tripura district called Fulsori. There is not  much  written about Sri Shanti Kali’s childhood but it is known that Sri   Shanti Ji always wanted to live his life to complete devotion to the   Parmeshwara and not wanted to live a materialistic life.\n\nStill,   his parents pressured him to get married. Even though he was married   and had two daughters Sri Shanti Kali always wanted to live an ascetic   life. Seeing his resolve his wife agreed to give him the divorce with a   precondition that before Sri Shanti Kali Ji goes on to live the life he   sought, he would wait for her to get remarried, a condition which Sri   Shanti Kali Ji accepted. After seven years his wife remarried and Sri   Shanti Ji could go on to live an ascetic life.\n\n**Sri   Shanti Kali Ji then left Tripura and went on a pilgrimage all across   India during which he gained the devotion and knowledge he sought.**   He took an oath that he would not only return to Tripura but also   establish a Temple in honor of Maa Tripura Sundari and an Ashram which   he will use to help local Tribals.\n\nHe went back to **Tripura and in 1979 on the auspicious day of Shiv Chaturdashi established Sri Shanti Kali Ashram**.   It is located at Manu in Subrum division of the district, From there  he  helped many peoples, mostly from local tribes. He also started  schools,  orphanages, and many more Ashrams.\n\n# Murder of a true Devote and Sadhu\n\nSri   Shanti Kali had become an icon for the local tribes which made him a   threat in eyes of Christian terrorists who ran forced Conversion   operations in those areas and spread the separatist agenda.\n\nSri Shanti Kali Ji had been threatened by Christian missionaries many times, **they   wanted him and his devotees to convert to Christianity. Adamant in his   mission and devotion to Maa Tripura Sundari he refused again and  again.** Even though Sri Shanti Ji’s life was at risk he continued his good fight for Sanatan Dharma.\n\nOn the night of 27 August 2000, Sri Shanti Kali Ji was present in his Ashram along with local Devotees. That night **Christian   Militants belonging to the separatist organization, NLFT, broke into   the ashram and Murdered the Gurudev Sri Shanti Kali along with his many   followers for the crime of following Hinduism and not converting to   Christianity.** He was shot from a close range and was taken to a hospital nearby where the Gurudev took his last breath on 10:53 PM.\n\nIn the same month, another Hindu leader of the Jamatya community, Jaulushmoni Jamatya, was also murdered.\n\nAfter nearly three months the death of Sri Shanti Kali Ji, his **ashram at Chachu Bazar near the Sidhai police station was raided by Christian terrorists.** In the following months, many of his Schools, Orphanages, and Ashrams were forcefully closed my Christian missionaries.\n\n# Legacy of Gurudev Shanti Kali\n\nEven   after his death, Sri Shanti Kali Ji’s legacy lives on as Sri Shanti   Kali Mission. They have more than ten branches of their Ashrams and   fighting for the very existence of Sanatan Dharma in Tripura.\n\nSources - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanti_Kali)\n\n[Tripura.org.in](http://www.tripura.org.in/shantikali.htm)'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'gtcg32'<br />Score:27<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gtcg32/the_murder_of_gurudev_shri_shanti_kali_ji/</li>

Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although Kṛṣṇa had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness — either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gītā.\n\n**Question 1 : What difficulty Arjuna is facing while contemplating on the subjects discussed by Lord Krishna ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chapter 3: Karma-yoga](https://preview.redd.it/n42mirm51u151.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947793f6d39dab594ed7f129f5c55077f5a1f647)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual\u200b](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gt8a6k'<br />Score:10<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gt8a6k/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_32/</li>

The nation achieved\xa0financial inclusion, free gas and electricity connections, total sanitation coverage, and made progress towards ensuring ‘housing for all’.\n\n\nIndia demonstrated its mettle through the surgical strike and air strike. At the same time, old demands such One Rank One Pension, One Nation One Tax, and better minimum support price (MSP) for farmers were fulfilled.\n\n\nIn 2019, Indians voted not merely for continuity but also with a dream of taking India to new heights, of making India a global leader. Today, 130 crore people feel involved and integrated in the development trajectory of the nation. The light of Jan Shakti and Rashtra Shakti has ignited the entire nation. Powered by the mantra of ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’, India is marching forward in all spheres.\n\n\nIn the last one year, some decisions were widely discussed and remain etched in public discourse.\xa0Article 370\xa0furthered the spirit of national unity and integration. The Ram Mandir judgment, delivered unanimously by\xa0Supreme Court, brought an amicable end to a debate persisting for centuries. The barbaric practice of instant triple talaq has been confined to the dustbin of history.\n\n\nAmendment to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was an expression of India’s spirit of inclusiveness. The creation of the post of the chief of defence staff (CDS) was a long-pending reform that has improved coordination among the armed forces. At the same time, India has stepped up preparations for\xa0Mission Gaganyaan.\n\n\nEmpowering the poor, farmers, women and youth has remained our priority. PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi now includes all farmers. In one year, more than Rs 72,000 crore has been deposited in the accounts of over 9.5 crore farmers. Jal Jeevan Mission will ensure supply of potable drinking water through piped connections to over 15 crore rural households.\n\n\nA huge campaign of free vaccination is being conducted for better health of our 50 crore livestock. For the first time, farmers, farm labourers, small shopkeepers and workers in the unorganised sector are assured the provision of a regular monthly pension of Rs 3,000 after age 60.\n\n\nBesides the facility of availing bank loans, a separate department has also been created for fishermen. Several other decisions will boost the blue economy.\n\n\nSimilarly, it has been decided to constitute a\xa0Vyapari Kalyan Board\xa0for the timely resolution of problems of traders. Higher quantum of financial assistance is being provided to more than seven crore women attached to self-help groups (SHGs). Recently, the loans without guarantee for SHGs have been doubled to Rs 20 lakh from Rs 10 lakh.\n\n\nWe have begun the construction of more than 400 new Ekalavya model residential schools keeping tribal welfare in mind. Several people-friendly laws have been ushered in during the last year. Parliament has broken its record in terms of productivity. As a result, whether it be the Consumer Protection Act, the amendment to Chit Fund Law, or laws to provide more protection to women, children and the divyang, their passage in the Parliament was expedited.\n\n\nAs a result of GoI policies, the rural-urban gap is shrinking. For the first time, the number of rural Indians using internet is 10% more than the number of urban Indians. Every day of this year, my government has worked round the clock with vigour, taking and implementing these decisions.\n\n\nAs we were moving ahead at fast pace in the fulfilment of hopes and aspirations of our countrymen, the\xa0coronavirus\xa0pandemic engulfed India. While India has economic resources and state-of-the-art healthcare systems, it is also besieged with problems amid a vast population and limited resources. Many feared that India will become a global problem. But today, through sheer confidence and resilience, you have transformed the way the world looks at us. You have proven that the collective strength and potential of Indians is unparalleled even when compared to more prosperous nations.\n\n\nBe it clapping and lighting a lamp, or the honouring of our Covid warriors by India’s armed forces, to the janta curfew and adherence to rules during the nationwide lockdown, on every occasion you have shown that ‘Ek Bharat’ is the guarantee for ‘Shrestha Bharat’.\n\n\nIn a crisis of this magnitude, it can certainly not be claimed that no one suffered any inconvenience or discomfort. Our labourers, migrant workers, artisans and craftsmen, hawkers and many other fellow countrymen have undergone tremendous suffering.\n\n\nHowever, we have to take care to ensure that inconveniences we are facing do not turn into disasters. Hence, it is very important for every Indian to follow all rules and guidelines. We have displayed patience so far, and we should continue to do so. This is one of the important reasons for India being safer and in a better state than many other countries. This is a long battle, but we have started traversing on the path of victory, and victory is our collective resolve.\n\n\nIn the last few days, a super cyclone has wreaked havoc in parts of West Bengal and Odisha. Here too, the resilience of the people of these states is noteworthy. Their courage inspires the people of India.\n\n\nAt such a time, there is also a widespread debate on how the economies of various countries, including India’s, will recover. However, given the way India has surprised the world with its unity and resolve in the fight against Covid-19, there is a firm belief that we will also set an example in economic revival. In the economic domain, 130 crore Indians can not only surprise the world, but also inspire it.\n\n\nIt is the need of the hour that we must become self-reliant. We have to move forward based on our own abilities, in our own way, and there is only one way to do it — Atmanirbhar Bharat, or\xa0Self-Reliant India. The recent Rs 20 lakh crore package given for Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (ABA) is a major step in this direction. This initiative will usher in a new era of opportunities for every Indian.\n\n\nThe fragrance of Indian soil, along with the sweat, hard work and talent of our workers will create products that will reduce India’s dependence on imports and will move it towards self-reliance.\n\n\nIt is the strength of your blessings in the last six years that has made the nation take historic decisions and progress rapidly in the last one year. However, I am also aware that there is a lot that needs to be done. There are many challenges and problems that our country faces. I am working day and night. There could be deficiencies in me but there is nothing that our country lacks. So, I believe in you, your strength and your abilities even more than I believe in myself. The source of strength for my resolve is you, your support, blessings and affection.\n\n\nDue to the pandemic, we certainly face a crisis. But for us, this is also a time for a firm resolve. We must always remember that the present and future of 130 crore will never be dictated by an adversity. We will decide our present and our future. We will move ahead on the path of progress and victory will be ours.\n\n\nIn Sanskrit, is said, ‘Kritm mein dakshine hashte, jayo mein satya ahitya — if we have action and duty on one hand, then success is assured in the other.\n\n\nWith prayers for our country’s success, I bow to you once again. My heartiest wishes to you and your family. Stay healthy, stay safe. Stay aware, stay informed.\n\n\nYour pradhan sevak\nNarendra Modi'<br />Author: 'SiliconKumarSharma'  id: 'gsytkj'<br />Score:11<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gsytkj/pm_modis_letter_to_the_people_of_india_a_year/</li>

For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirvāṇa. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Attainment of Kṛṣṇa consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God."\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n**Question 2 : What is the difference between the material world and the spiritual world ?**\n\n**Answer 2 :** "In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."\n\n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.72, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oowp4u3cyp151.jpg?width=681&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f71f1d71aa724775d59b387ad5d7ca9d15f388\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

Many of us don\'t know that you have to clean under the foreskin of your penis. Otherwise Smegma will build up under the foreskin also known as "Dick cheese" Left untreated, smegma can cause an odor or in some cases, harden and lead to irritation in the genitals and thats why you see some guys hand always in thier pants. And yes you can and should pull the foreskin all the way back to make sex and masturbation more enjoyable and if you are not able to do that don\'t worry its normal and there are many excercise\'s to make foreskin more stretchy.\n\nHow to clean the smegma or how to clean under the foreskin?\n\nProperly cleaning your penis is the easiest way to remove smegma\n\nGently pull back your foreskin. If the smegma has hardened, you may not be able to pull it back all the way. Don’t force it, as that can cause pain and tear the skin, which could lead to infection.\n\nUse a mild soap and warm water to wash the area that’s usually covered by your foreskin. Avoid harsh scrubbing, as that can irritate the sensitive skin. If the smegma has hardened, gently rubbing oil on the area before cleaning it may help loosen up the accumulation.\n\nThoroughly rinse off all the soap and then gently pat the area dry.\n\nPull your foreskin back over the tip of your penis.\n\nRepeat this daily until the smegma disappears.\n\nEdit If your looking for the stretching excercises :\n\nExcercise\'s Video https://youtu.be/Q17x2LQIek0\n\nExcercise https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wikihow.fitness/Do-Phimosis-Stretching%3famp=1'<br />Author: 'Critical_Finance'  id: 'gs1r3u'<br />Score:25<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gs1r3u/you_have_to_clean_under_the_foreskin_of_your/</li>

Most of them are threatening India for war and they blame India for ever. They study in India, get business and work from India, yet they leave no chance to abuse us. Why India always have to play big brother to such thankless countries? Indians give a huge boost to Nepalese tourism industry and economy. And Nepal is acting like India is one big evil.\n\nSo what can we do? We have got the worst neighbours in the world so we have to be strong as a fort and unified. One thing I feel the need of is to make it mandatory for each Indian to learn one language from each zone eg. If a person belongs to UP, he should learn one language from a Western State, one from a southern state, one from an eastern state and one from a North Eastern state. As far as I know, if someone has a basic understanding of Sanskrit, learning the languages from Indian family is not very difficult.\n\nSecond thing, is for our professionals to shift from service based industry to product based industry. Instead of taking pride in no. of Indians working in Google, Facebook, Amazon, NASA, twitter we should focus on building a parallel infrastructure like China. Basically, the information we are getting is filtered through American lens and do you expect Washington Post, New York Times to give you a true picture of what actually is happening.\n\nThird thing, would be for the media channels to stop giving platforms to Pakistanis to spew venom on Indian television (One Pakistani panelist Arzoo Kazmi was shameless enough to call brave Abhinandan a 'donkey').\n\nFourth thing would be to treat each traitor as a traitor inspite of gender, state or community.

Also, while there’s been some representation of North Indian culture (Gangs of Wasseypur gen etc), no one knows the streets/villages/culture of Delhi or Haryana or UP, Rajasthan, MP etc..the way we know Lokhandwala, Wadala, Bandra, Juhu, Link Road, Andheri, Nala Supara etc because these have been a part of popular culture in Bollywood movies.\n\nThere’s no dearth of creative talent in northern India, even NSD is in Delhi. And it’s not impossible to make movies in Delhi. The biggest challenge has been “distribution mafia” that’s dominated by Mumbai. You can make your movie, but you need to put it on a few hundred or thousand screens and that’s controlled by distributors.\n\nWith the current situation and possibility of releases going on OTT players, distributors are likely to go out of picture. This is an unprecedented opportunity to decentralise Hindi film industry and balance the power (this will result in more options for talent, reducing casting couch and also levelling the playing field a bit). It’ll also popularise local spots and culture and attract tourism, and also jobs for local folks who currently migrate to Mumbai to “struggle”\n\nIt would be cool to see Dilliwood, and maybe even Sonepatwood, Jaipurwood, Kashiwood etc. by the “wood” suffix, I don’t mean we need to name it such, but it’s just to convey an idea of building multiple Hindi movie industries.\n\nI do believe Dilliwood has a potential to become much bigger than Bollywood if some right.'<br />Author: 'CoolGuess'  id: 'grzh2s'<br />Score:6<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/grzh2s/time_for_dilliwood/</li>

This is to point out the flaw in his teaching that he even taught the person who was destined to kill him later in life.

Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PURPORT**\n\nOne can attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second-or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Kṛṣṇa. Nirvāṇa means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gītā teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirvāṇa. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Attainment of Kṛṣṇa consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\n\nBrahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore brāhmī sthitiḥ means "not on the platform of material activities." Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-gītā as the liberated stage. Therefore, brāhmī-sthitiḥ is liberation from material bondage.\n\nŚrīla Bhaktivinode Ṭhākur has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-gītā as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-gītā, the subject matters are karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, and bhakti-yoga. In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and jñāna-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.\n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of its Contents.\n\n**Question 1 : Why it is said that a Krishna conscious person has already entered the kingdom of God ?**\n\n**Question 2 : What is the difference between the material world and the spiritual world ?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tuado4mtkf151.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec537b8fe03aec69dac68d04b3ce9c486c8c25c1\n\nNow you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)'<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'grz6aq'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/grz6aq/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is_272/</li>

But the ocean remains the same — steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit of its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires, because of his fullness. A Kṛṣṇa conscious man is not in need of anything, because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean — always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a Kṛṣṇa conscious man — one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present.  \nBecause he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who want to fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace.

Was a lockdown actually needed?\n2. What was the purpose of Lockdown?\n3. How was the implementation?\n4. Did we achieve our purpose.\n\nHere are my thoughts:-\n\n1. Was there a need for a country wide lockdown?\n\nWell, yes! There was a need for a lockdown, we saw what happened (is happening) in the countries which did not impose lockdowns, and specially for a country like India, the only sensible way was a complete lockdown!\n\n2. What was the purpose?\n\nWhile some may think the purpose of the lockdown was to completely eliminate corona virus from India, but the actual purpose was to give the medical sector time to prepare themselves! And slow down the infection rate.\n\n3. How was the implementation?\n\nIn my opinion implementation was horrible, it seemed as if Center and state completely took the migrant workers out of the equation, people were stuck! With no means of transport to reach their homes! Shops were short of the essentials, and Chaos was created by the government.\n\n4. Did we achieve the purpose?\n\nWith over 2 months gone, the cases are still rising sharply, the migrant workers haven't reached their homes yet, many migrants have died due to hunger or depression, our health sector is struggling. Overall it's still a mess!\n\nThat's it!

      <li>Title::: 'Modernization without Westernization and Rabid Hindutva'<br />Body: " The ideal state for humanity is a form of global village where racial distincitions are irrelevent, we can judge people by who they are and the system holding the framework together is robust enough to allow different ideas to formulate without the risk of conflict.\n\nThis already exists in some form with modern nation states grouping around cultural identities : Western Europe and the Russian Orthodox bloc are prominent examples of this. You've got China and Japan that are separate civilizational states, an Asian block that includes Taiwan, Singpaore, Malaysia etc, an Islamic block which identifies itself around Islam but has no clear leader, a Latin American bloc, an emerging African bloc and then there is India. Now, to bring all these blocks together under the flag of humanity we have to first establish a set of universal values and that can serve as our commonality like the human rights declaration and wait for all the block to achieve an advanced state of implementation to start having discussions on an even plane on how to move forward. There is no point weaponizing this as the West sometimes tend to do and there is no point forcing this onto blocs as it will lead to conflict due to human nature of grouping things into 'us' vs 'them'.\n\nA critical factor to keep in mind is that different blocs have different cultures and evidence is there to prove that different cultures can be just as succesful as each other. Japanese and Singaporean values whilst having some commonalities also have some fundamental differences from Western society and attempting to impose either set of cultural values on the other will increase the risk of resentment and conflict.\n\nKeeping all this in mind, the individual blocs first have to achieve a state in which they are confident in their own cultural values, the people buy into this collective consciousness and they can have a mature conversation with cultures that are fundamentally different so that we can then roll up the grouping of people into a global village. This stage has only been achieved by the Western and Japanese blocs and now the Sino and the Asian blocs.\n\nAll the above factors are playing out within the borders of India itself where in we have created certain universal values such as the belief in democracy and we have created a certain commonality around the Indian identity but we are facing critical problems in the fact that within our universal value such as democarcy people are falling prey to tribal divisions subverting the merits of a democratic system and amplifying its drawbacks which leads us to the conclusion that the rallying cry around and a secular Indian identity was not strong enough to break these tribal bonds down. The other rallying cry lies in the fact that the Indian nation is culturally home to the Hindus and Hinduism and the common thread that can be found across the country which stretches back close to 5000 years and could perhaps be a far quicker unifying bond allowing the nation to push forward as one. Evidence of nations industrializing and increasing living standards wilst rapidly proliferating education when united under a banner that the populace believes on a visceral level is littered throughout history and the data point of a nation that has achieved this whilst being a liberal democracy is 0 or 1 depending on how you classify Turkey which is also experiencing a strong Islamist revival movement now.\n\nThe question of Indias Muslim population is a relevent question and if the nation redefines iteself or in this case takes popular will into account on one along Hindu lines then what is the future of Indias Muslims? The extremists would advocate for a population transfer something which is impossible as neither Pakistan nor Bangaladesh would agree to it or a mass conversion which would be an inefficient solution considering the myriad of other problems since the memories and stories could spark an armed rebellion. In theory, the discipline of the Indian Army could crush such a rebellion should push come to shove but we would expose a fault line that could take another decade or two to solve by force. Time which we do not have in todays changing world.\n\nRather, we must attempt to impose the universal values that apply to the rest of society to the Muslim portion as well something which secular India failed to do for an inexplicable reason and we must move rapidly to bring the Muslim portion in to the mainstream of Hindu culture. In order to do this, we will have to make sufficient space so that they feel comforatble displaying their Islamic identity and they will need to modify their belief system such as dropping the idea of monoethism and become culturally Hindu.\n\nThe development of a culture that draws on its roots of the Dharmic faiths is a culture that has the highest chance of being rapidly accepted by the masses of the people that will soon undergo rapid change in their lifestyles and with all these factors in mind we believe the clarion call should be Modernization without Westernization."<br />Author: 'desiblood'  id: 'grketf'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/grketf/modernization_without_westernization_and_rabid/</li>

In other words, desire for becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one's actual position as the eternal servitor of Kṛṣṇa, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Kṛṣṇa conscious he fought because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for Kṛṣṇa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa (īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization-namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa in spiritual identity. and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of Kṛṣṇa or greater than Him. This understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the basic principle of real peace.\n\n**Question 1 : What is real desirelessness ?**\n\n  \n**Question 2 : FITB : The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hv33f9r29151.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb5321ef498e27746a31949acec7353567e8f86d\n\n Now you can get these daily verses (With Pictures and QA) directly on your Android phone using our App. Please download it from Here : [Bhagavad Gita Multilingual](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bhagavadgita.multilingual)"<br />Author: 'usernamealrdytakn'  id: 'gre729'<br />Score:2<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gre729/verse_of_the_day_bhagavadgita_as_it_is271/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 1 Text 1'<br />Body: " **Chapter 1:** Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra\n\n**Text 1:** \n\n *dhrtarastra uvaca*  \n*dharma-ksetre kuru-ksetre*  \n*samaveta yuyutsavah*  \n*mamakah pandavas caiva*  \n*kim akurvata sanjaya* \n\n**Translation:**\n\nDhrtarastra said: O Sanjaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kurukshetra, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, being desirous to fight? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe philosophy of Bhagavad Gita evolved in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, which is a place of pilgrimage from the immemorial times of Vedic age. This is why it is referred as *dharma-ksetre kuru-ksetre.* The word *dharma-ksetre* is important here because the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is himself present in the battlefield from the side of Arjuna. \n\nSanjaya was endowed with vision which allowed him to observe everything in the battlefield, even though being far away in the palace sitting alongside Dhrtarastra. Dhrtarastra was born blind and hence could not see anything. Sanjaya was narrating the entire episode happening to him in real time. Sanjaya could do this because he was the student of Vyasa and was able to see due to the mercy of Vyasa.\n\nBy this point in the Mahabharata, Dhrtarastra had already known that the cousins had assembled together desiring for a war after all the efforts at mediating had failed. But, even then this question asked by him to Sanjaya is important here. It is because Dhrtarastra wanted to be sure that there was no compromise among the cousins and also know about the fate of his sons in the ensuing war.\n\nTwo more things can be inferred here:\n\n1. Dhrtarastra's mind is disclosed herein, where he claimed only his sons to be Kurus and not the sons of Pandu, even though all of them descended from the same dynasty.\n2. As it was a religious place, with historical and Vedic importance, the father of religion, Sri Krishna being present on the side of Padavas would ensure their victory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This is in continuation to a previous post which can be found from my account."<br />Author: 'indian_philosophy'  id: 'gr5kzu'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gr5kzu/bhagavad_gita_chapter_1_text_1/</li>

How they are different from each other ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** "There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the "night" of the materialistic men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress. He goes on with his self-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction."  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 2.69, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86n1g9et25151.png?width=535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31050da6907f702632b16ec1396bf20198cbb8fd\n\nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

      <li>Title::: '[UPDATE] Manipal Institute of Technology has repeatedly ignored student concerns about the conduction of online exams using proctoring software, such as Internet connectivity and lack of study materials available, while planning online exams for all students regardless of their situations'<br />Body: '_[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gq8ocd/manipal_institute_of_technology_has_repeatedly/)_\n\nThere has not been a direct official response as yet for MIT students from the Director\'s office of MIT, but there has been a list of FAQ\'s published for MIC (Manipal Institute of Communication), college in the same campus as MIT. In them, the college states that the exam will not need a continous Internet connection, which is contradictory to HoD\'s responses MIT students have received from their own college, so it cannot be confirmed as yet. This also renders using a different application entirely useless, as we are currently having small tests (5% of our total grade per subject) using Microsoft Teams, where we receive questions and have to send a handwritten solution as a PDF before the deadline of 1.5 hours (extra time given for scanning and submission), yet here we are. Using Teams will also alleviate the following problem: \n\n&gt;4. I have an iOS device and not a MS Windows device \nThe online exam application currently only supports MS Windows. Therefore, if you do not have a laptop with Windows OS, we request you to make arrangements to hire/ borrow one for the duration of the exams. The same device has to be used for all the exams that you take online. \n\nThe college has been pretty adamant on insisting that anyone who does not have a Windows machine should borrow them from someone, come what may. Keep in mind we have 2 sets of examinations over a period of 2 months, so borrowing a machine, especially keeping in mind the lockdown restrictions making it harder for people to even step outside of their homes. [An example of a staff member asking a student to essentially break the law to get their laptop from Manipal to Mangalore, where they are residing at the moment.](https://twitter.com/kafkaesque00/status/1264842853798178816?s=09) This has still been the attitude of the staff in communicating with students, and it has been the cause of a lot of confusion and outrage in the student body, unfortunately. \n\nStudents, regardless of what the college feels, are still strapped for study essentials, and yet the college refuses to make slight compromises, like [here](https://imgur.com/1ZMESTl).\n\n[The 2nd year students of the Electrical &amp; Electronics Department have already received a schedule for mid-semester examinations, due to take place on the 9th of June, till the 20th.](https://imgur.com/a/Y1qRKEF) Most branches have been given dates for lab examinations, with no practical experiment, via Microsoft Teams and no proctoring, however. In an earlier notice, it was also declared that the weightage of these examinations will be reduced in the lab grade, from 40% to 20%, in an [earlier notice](https://imgur.com/zluV8sS). Additionally, more and more departments have started putting out syllabi for their mid-semester exams, all to be held tentatively from the 8th of June. It is clear that the college has decided to simply move on with this decision.\n\nNot for not trying, though. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/shhh53765868/status/1264572202814525445?s=20) that I mentioned in the previous post as well has become a central point in trying to bring this situation to the MoHRD, UGC and/or any news outlet\'s notice. [Twitter page here has attempted to complie all examples of the college\'s callousness in full display.](https://twitter.com/helpmanipal)  \n\nIn the MIC FAQ, the college tries to explain its reasoning to the students, over why it chose to take exams online instead of cancelling them, like multiple IITs, NITs and MAHE\'s own sister institutions decided to (sources: [1](https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs/coronavirus-lockdown-iit-kanpur-semester-exams-cancelled-all-students-passed-en-bloc-to-next-semester/1969153/) [2](https://www.telegraphindia.com/calcutta/coronavirus-lockdown-nit-durgapur-gives-up-on-online-exam/cid/1769512)). Here is the excerpt: \n\n&gt;**1.Why the need for online exams? Why can’t we be promoted on the basis of IA marks like how some of the IITs have done?**\n\n&gt;MAHE and its constituent colleges decided to conduct online examinations after much discussion and debate. We are conducting online exams for the benefit of our students. This is not a last-minute solution as has been pointed out by the students. \n\n&gt;Promoting students merely on their IA marks would have been an easy way out but, we are not in favor of it. Consider this: what if the college that you are going to apply for higher studies or the organization that is hiring you (either immediately or several years later) insists that you must have both internal assessments marks as well as external/ end-semester exam marks to consider you as eligible for admission or job? The education sector has encountered such scenarios in the past and we clearly do not want out students to encounter similar unfavorable situations where your academic credentials will be questioned. \n\n&gt;Please understand that in 2020 people will remember the pandemic but, ten years down the line things may not be the same. Also, I understand that a lot of students who have been placed/accepted for higher studies and have to submit their marksheets by August 2020.\n\n&gt;Therefore, conducting an end-semester examination is necessary and in the given circumstances conducting an online exam is the best feasible option\n\nThe college has yet not officially declared the name of the application that shall be used for the exams, but it is rumoured to be [PEXA Lite](http://www.littlemoreinnovation.com/pexa-lite/). It clearly states it is device-agnostic, BUT the college insists that everyone will require a Windows machine, and they must obtain it any way possible, as I mentioned above. \n\n&gt;**5.I am not in a position to write the online examinations. What provision do I have to earn my credits/ marks?**\n \n&gt;For students who for various reasons are not able to take the exams now, we have given the option of writing a make-up exam when the college reopens. Despite it being a make-up exam, your end-semester marksheet will not indicate that you are taking a different exam.\n\nThis is the only way out for students unable to take this exam at home. This information was already given to us by the college, but authorities have requested parental consent as well in other notices for students to skip the online exams. And again, people with macOS devices have yet again been asked to make "other arrangements" for the duration of these exams, which tentatively are going to be held from 8th June to mid/late-July.\n\nOver at Twitter, a student made a fake twitter account using Dr. D Shrikanth Rao\'s name (MIT\'s Director). It got suspended, and there has been, reportedly (mind you it\'s literally a WhatsApp forward) a response for that, by the college: \n\n&gt;(Forwarded) The person who made fake acc of director on twitter is getting rusticated\n\nI would like to reiterate here that this response is not a direct circular issued by MIT, but a different college under MAHE which is run in the same campus as MIT.\n\nThe Twitter campaign ([here](https://twitter.com/shhh53765868/status/1264572202814525445?s=20)) to bring all this to the attention of someone in power seems to be the one thing we can plant all our hopes on, because other than that, it seems to be futile after all. Open letters, a planned barrage of e-mails to every single official email and the twitter campaign itself, all have fallen on deaf ears. With the upcoming tests, lab exams and everything else, even I feel like I will have to cut back on this. Drafting these, asking info from everywhere and putting it in words as well as adding sources takes some time, which I\'d do well in if I could use them to study. I wish I could post a positive update soon, but it really doesn\'t seem like that will happen anymore. All your words were very kind, and your suggestions came with good intent, but until someone in a big office somewhere doesn\'t read this, nothing will happen.'<br />Author: 'mitmanthrowaway'  id: 'gqv0e6'<br />Score:14<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gqv0e6/update_manipal_institute_of_technology_has/</li>

      <li>Title::: 'What does the community think about "Filter Bubble", and the effect it has on our country?'<br />Body: "Let's start with definitions first:\n\n&gt;A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation that allegedly can result from personalized searches, when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles\n\nBill gates was quoted saying that \n\n&gt;(Technology such as social media) “lets you go off with like-minded people, so you're not mixing and sharing and understanding other points of view ... It's super important. It's turned out to be more of a problem than I, or many others, would have expected.”  \n—\u2009Bill Gates 2017 in *Quartz*\n\nSelf-created content manifested from behavior patterns can lead to partial information blindness. Social media websites like Facebook may also present content in a way that makes it difficult for the user to determine the source of the content, leading them to decide for themselves whether the source is reliable or fake. \n\nThis can lead to people becoming used to hearing what they want to hear, which can cause them to react more radically when they see an opposing viewpoint. The filter bubble may cause the person to see any opposing viewpoints as incorrect and could allow the media to force views onto consumers.\n\nOn a personal note, I believe this is partly to be blamed for turning people extreme. The left gets pushed further left, the right gets pushed further right, for example.

      <li>Title::: 'Fasadi, Not Jihadi'<br />Body: 'Those who wish the fight against terrorism to succeed need be careful to use correct words to describe the campaign and actions of the terrorists and give them not the satisfaction of adopting the terms by which they describe themselves.\n\nDuring his visit to West Asia, US President Bush made an impassioned plea to Arab media not to describe the suicide bombers as martyrs as the term lends the killers of innocent persons with the halo of religious glory. It is difficult to disagree with this line of argument.\n\nBut let us try to find out where this distorted use of words began. A person who steps out to take an innocent life is a criminal as per the teachings of every religion and all the secular laws. On the other hand, both the religions and the secular laws permit physical resistance against oppression and in self-defence. This has been variously described by different religious traditions as Dharm Yuddh, Just War and Jihad. The scriptures lay down in detail the circumstances that permit armed action and an exhaustive code of conduct.\n\nNow, if a resourceful person or group initiates a campaign that results in murder and mayhem and insists that it is jihad, should we accept the claim simply because this man is able to hog media attention due to the enormity of his crime and the damage caused? When he claims that it is jihad, he is aware of the sanctity and piety that is associated with this term in Islamic religious tradition. He knows there cannot be a better subterfuge to deceive a sizeable number of people and win their sympathy and support.\n\nIf without subjecting his claim to critical scrutiny we start describing him as a jihadi and his campaign as jihad then we are falling into his trap. Logically speaking, a jihadi, if killed, shall be described as a martyr at least by those who subscribe to that religious tradition. On the other hand, if his claim is tested and he is shown to be a pure and simple killer who is using religion to further his personal agenda or to cover his crimes, then the right Quranic term to describe him shall be fasadi, the mischief maker. As the Quran says: "Do no mischief on the earth after it has been set in order but call on Him with fear and longing: for the mercy of God is near to those who do good" (7.56)\n\nWhen someone claims to be spearheading an Islamic cause, then that claim must be subjected to Quranic scrutiny because the Book clearly says that: "God lays evil (filth) on those who will not use their reason" (10.100). In fact, a careful reading of the verses of Quran shows that human life is inviolable except in case of murder or for causing mischief. Quran says: "If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief (fasad) in the land it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people." (5.32).\n\nThe sanctity of human life has been upheld to the extent that even justified action was not permitted due to apprehension of loss of innocent lives. On the occasion of Hudaibiya, when Muslims refused to fight against the Quraysh despite adequate provocation, the Quran said: \n\n"They [the Unbelievers] are the ones who denied revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without knowledge. (God would have allowed you to force your way but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His mercy whom He will. If they had been apart We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous punishment "(48.25). Allah thus saved lives by ensuring peace with unbelievers.\n\nThese are only few references that show that causing murder and mayhem comes in the category of fasad-- a crime punishable with death, and not jihad a concept rooted in piety and selflessness. Those who wish the fight against terrorism to succeed need be careful to use correct words to describe the campaign and actions of the terrorists and give them not the satisfaction of adopting the terms by which they describe themselves. As George Orwell has said: "If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even among people who should know better."\n\nSource : [Intervention : Fasadi, Not Jihadi By Arif Mohammed Khan\n](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/fasadi-not-jihadi/237481)\n\nSimilar read : [Terrorists are Fasadi, not Jihadi By M J Akbar](https://www.newageislam.com/islam,terrorism-and-jihad/terrorists-are-fasadi,-not-jihadi/d/517)'<br />Author: 'yeloblu'  id: 'gqhfdw'<br />Score:12<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gqhfdw/fasadi_not_jihadi/</li>

To Conserve, Cash at all Costs, you will need it for unforeseen circumstances, including another lock-down\n\n2. Make Team A &amp; B. Team A studies prepares the current response, and Team B works on the situation after two years.\n\n3. You will have to increase wages for some workers to incentivize them to come back. Getting people back will be a problem\n\n4. The travel sector will be hit for a very long time. 2 years plus.\n\n5. 9 Months of this year will be gone in recovery in normalcy in terms of Operations coming back to normal.

Being Over leveraged will be a disaster, avoid the debt trap at all costs. Give a discount, let investors make money. Get Private Equity. Singapore Airlines is doing a Rights issue as we speak.\n\n8. Microfinance will be worst hit, amongst NBFCs.\n\n9. Build relationships and trust with the banks. Don’t move relationships for a quarter or half a percent.\n\n10. Await announcement for MSME. More incentives and support expected.\n\n11. Real Estate: Land is a state subject, Real Estate Prices will come down by 20% at least. Developers who have bought land at high prices will to take a hit on the projects. Many companies will go bankrupt. The industry must talk to the Govt for a one-time restructuring like in 2008. It will take 8-9 months for things to normalize for Real Estate.\n\n12. Payments from Govt is a big issue. Lot of litigation Macroeconomic Factors &amp; Risks, Long term Outlook from Government and RBI\n\n1. Govt has agreed to increase Fiscal Deficit which is a good sign. State Govts getting Overdraft facilities from Central Government.\n\n2. Consumer Credit is 13% as a percentage of GDP, whereas China is 40% and the USA 80%\n\n3. Mortgage to GDP, India: 10%, China: 26%, Thailand 20%, Scandinavia: 90% USA: 70%. India needs to reach the 12-15% mark in a coming couple of years.\n\n4. Yes Bank on Path on recovery, Should have taken part in a similar manner for ILFS and Jet Airways.\n\n5. USA 10 year paper is 0.77%, India is 6%. India is at a BBB (Lowest Investment Grade). If we get graded down we will become a Junk Bond. This will crash the economy. This is also why it will be difficult to print money.\n\n6. Interest rates will go down further, but Banks must pass it on to the company. RBI lends only to the Banks in India and Banks are concerned more about their own Balance Sheet than national interest. RBI must start buying Company Bonds.\n\n7. Middle-East will be in big trouble. The oil will not go back to 60-70. The oil will be at 40-50.\n\n8. Expect more deglobalization. European countries have already made it mandatory for Govt approval for all acquisition, as companies are available cheap and there is a fear that China may look to take over companies in Europe.\n\n9. Rupee will be under pressure. Look at a minimum 3% depreciation YoY of the rupee even in the best times. We are doing much better at the moment with 10% depreciation (Many are at 25%). Trouble will ensue only if our rating goes to Junk. Our Rating, unfortunately, has not gone up even in our Best Years of 8% growth. However, Companies are getting good borrowing rates. Exports will have to grow for India to do better. Expect a package for Export soon from the Government.\n\n10. By 2023 390 million people will come into the middle class. Hence investment will come. Only 2% of Indians are invested in Equity. Equity investors will increase. India Mutual fund to GDP the ratio is 12% whereas in Mexico etc. are 60% plus and the USA 100%. India needs to move to 20%. The rising middle class will lead to more investments in Real Estate and Equity in the long term.\n\n11. The savings rate in India is 17% (Earlier 30%). 10% out of that is in Real Estate or Golds etc. The liquid Savings rate is 7%. People in India are getting used to consumption in India. So there is no stress there. Hopeful that consumption will increase.\n\n12. EPFO should be allowed to invest in equity. They invested in IL&amp;FS and made a loss. So it is more conservative.\n\n13. There is a medicine (Cure) which is under testing in the USA, which hopefully should be out in the market by June end if FDA approves. Vaccine (preventive) will take time.'<br />Author: 'imperialfinsol'  id: 'gq90n4'<br />Score:3<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gq90n4/financial_market_current_scenario_business/</li>
      <li>Title::: 'Were Rajputs losers?'<br />Body: "Disclaimer - I am a Marathi, so this is more of an outside perspective.  \n\nFor most of our History, Rajputs were considered the epitome of bravery and chivalry, but then a new strain of twitter warriors came about according to whom Rajputs were a bunch of losers who gave their daughters to Mughals. \n \nThis whole meme of Rajputs being losers gets thrown around every time we discuss Indian history and does nothing more than to derail the conversation. The entire discussion requires some nuance which twitter lacks.   \n\n* Kingdoms vs Empires - First and foremost we need to understand the difference between Kingdoms and Empires, Rajputs states were a collection of around a dozen (some claim 36) prominent rival clans and not a singular empire. On top of that their home base of Rajputana was an arid region with small economies (in an age were agriculture=GDP), they couldn't possibly field large professional armies. Their armies consist of a martial elite core, insufficient to fight against large empires from the north.  \n\nSo why are they celebrated? Their clan system similar to the ones of Anglo-Saxons provided them with staying power. Rajputs came before the Mamluks, Khiljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Suris, Mughals, etc, and outlived them.   \n\nNone of these empires ever tried to replace the Rajputs with their own rule simply because they lacked the capacity. At best they could simply make them their vassals with relative independence. As long as the Rajputs paid their tributes they could rule freely.   \nTry to impose your own rule and then you had to deal with people like Maharana Pratap, try to interfere with their internal matters and you get people like Durgadas Rathore. When Aurangzeb imposed jizya, Shivaji taunted him by saying that he should try collecting jizya from Rana Raj Singh instead of terrorising poor peasants.   \n\nRajputs elites were legendary warriors widely recognised for their bravery (there are hundreds of Islamic and English sources that that regard Rajputs as the epitome of chivalry), they formed the backbone of Mughal armies and lead many campaigns on their behalf. Mughals were extremely keen on keeping them together hence the marriage alliances. Any Rajput clan (except Mewar) was happy to form the alliance which guaranteed to increase their influence. Jahangir was half Rajput by birth, Shah Jahan was 3/4th Rajput, this tells us the power Rajput women welded in the courts.  \n Jodha Bai (=Harka Bai or Mariam-uz-Zamani, i.e. Mother mary of the age) despite the purdah she still managed to be one of the biggest business women of the period, she had a large fleet of trade ships and even went toe to toe with the Brits and Portuguese. She even had the right to issue *farmans*. This considering the fact that Akbar had at least 5000 women in his harem.    \n\nWhen Brahmins objected to Shivaji because he was a lower cast, he simply claimed ancestry from Sisodiyas (who claimed ancestry from lord Ram), so did many later Sikhs and Gorkha leaders. People to this day claim ancestry from Rajputs, this wouldn't be the case if they saw Rajputs as losers. Hell despite being Muslims, some claim Rajput ancestry (although the clans they claim ancestry from weren't really prominent or well regarded). Shah Muhammad Ramzan (1769-1825) observes that many Muslim Rajputs still keep their Hindu practises.  \n\nThen there is this another claim that Rajputs were actually descendants of invading Huns who were defeated by the Guptas. This fits nicely into colonial-era historiography of martial races. Modern scholarship tells us that Rajputs are descendants of a diverse group of people from Brahmins to lower castes, they became landholding nobility and through marital alliances (roti-beti), they came to be one group. The Hun hypothesis assumes that their numbers were large enough to displace local nobility pre-existing at that time. Just like *Thakur* and *Kayastha* were titles for a diverse group of people but over time became their own caste groups.  \n\nIf Rajputs were well regarded by everyone, so when this meme of Rajputs being losers started?  \n\nJames Tod in his *Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan* popularised the romantic notion of Rajput pride, chivalry and bravery, Rajputs were seen as natural allies of Brits, this all ended with 1857 rebellion when only Sikhs and Gurkhas remained loyal to the Brits. New notions were formed (essentially propaganda) of the martial prowess of these groups. This propaganda still holds you will still see these oft-repeated in places like Reddit.  \n Sikh kingdom barely lasted 50 years, it was created due to stalemate between Afghans and Marathas over Punjab (both sides lost over 40k in the battle of Panipat, such numbers were unheard of before, crippling them both for some time), the power vacuum after Panipat allowed Sikhs to confederate, Sikhs are oft regarded as short term victors of the battle, despite their Maratha allies losing (Brits being the real victor in the long term). Not implying Sikhs aren't great warriors but they don't have the long legacy of Rajputs.  \nGurkhas are regarded as super soldiers on Reddit but they also lack the long history and acknowledgement from multiple opponents Rajputs have. They also claim (and probably truthfully) ancestry from Rajputs.  \n\nFor liberals Rajput being upper caste, they are regarded with contempt (funnily enough despite being lower caste Marathas are also targeted), this is how the whole meme began. Nothing but a modern invention by twitter trolls. I admit that I do cringe when I see people flaunt their caste as something to be proud of.  \n\nIf Rajputs were of diverse origin, why are they regarded as upper caste?   \nPowerful groups of a particular region often underwent a *caste promotion*, the most famous of the rituals for these purposes was the *Hiranya Garbha* ritual, the King who underwent this received a caste promotion and were regarded as Kshatriya. Most rulers performed these rituals for legitimacy. Marathas are now regarded as open category, while their Kunbi brothers are OBCs.   \n\nthis is just my random rambling because I am tired of this meme comping up in every discussion on Indian history."<br />Author: 'PorekiJones'  id: 'gq902q'<br />Score:47<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gq902q/were_rajputs_losers/</li>

The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the "night" of the materialistic men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress.

      <li>Title::: 'Rani Durgavati - The Great Hindu Warrior Queen'<br />Body: '# Background - Islamic forces in India\n\nIn the year 1524, the Mughals had started their campaign in India. To say they were successful would be an understatement. **The lack of unity showed by Indians turned out to be the greatest mistake in History of any Empire and cost us hundreds of year and millions of lives**.\n\nBut in the same year when the Mughal took their initial steps towards India, in the month of October a girl was born in the royal family of **Chandel Emperor Keerat Rai** at the fort of Kalanjar (now in Banda, UP). She was named **Durgavati, a name that indicated what Bhagya had written for her**. The Chandel Kingdom was well known for its bravery. They had fought many wars and successfully defended the Kingdom many times against the Islamic Warlord Mahmud Ghaznavi.\n\nThe Chandel Kingdom along with other Hindu kingdoms was declining and due to no unity, many other Hindu kingdoms were now being subject to Islamic rule. At this time Rani Durgavati Ji was still a child. There was not much written about the childhood days of Rani Durgavati Ji. But it is well known that she spent her childhood in the fort of Kalanjar. She was very well versed not only in Scriptures of Dharma but also in the art of war. **She had mastery over various weapons whether it was gun, sword or bow and arrow. She was a good shot in all of them and regularly went for hunting.**\n\n# Marriage to Dalpat Shah, of Gond dynasty\n\nWhen she turned 18 years old in the year 1542 a marriage between her and Dalpat Shah, *the eldest son of King Sangram of Gond dynasty*, was stuck. The marriage was also believed to be a political move to strengthen the dynasties as both Chandel and Gond had a mutual enemy of Islamic invaders who at this point controlled not only Delhi Sultanate but most of neighbouring Kingdom. The Gond Dynasty ruled over four kingdoms i.e. Garha-Mandla, Kherla, Deogarh and Chanda.\n\nSoon after their marriage, Dalpat Shah had taken over the right s of Kingdom. **The Muslim attacks on the Hindu kingdoms had increased especially on the Kalanjar fort where the queen had spent her childhood.** In the year 1545, the Islamic warlord Sher Sha Suri had invaded the Kalanjar fort. But in the same year, the queen gave birth to a boy who was named Vir Narayan. But the happiness soon faded away when mere five years later in 1550 the King Dalpat Ji passed away leaving a 5-year-old heir to a throne.\n\n# Death of the King and taking the Reigns of the Kingdom\n\nAfter a mere eight years of marriage the queen had lost her husband and now was the sole defender and ruler of the Kingdom. Rani Durgavati Ji knew after hearing the news of the death of the King the Islamic rulers will try to invade the Kingdom. She took the reigns of the kingdom in her hands. **During her rule the kingdom prospered, she selected the advisors and ministers that were not only loyal to the kingdom but also who were capable in their jobs.** She extended the territory of the kingdom, the trade flourished and politically unified the Gondwana. Rani moved her capital to Chauragarh from Singaurgarh. She displayed tact, courage and generosity. Out of 23,000 Villages, 12,000 were directly managed by her. She built a reservoir close to Jabalpur, called Ranital and then two more reservoirs Cherital and the Adhartal were built by her ministers.\n\nThe Gondwana kingdom shared the border with Malwa and Rewa kingdom. After the death of the Sher Shah Suri in 1556, Sujat Khan captured the Malwa zone and his son Baz Bahadur had taken the reigns of Malwa kingdom. **On many occasions, he tried to attack and invade the Gondwana. Rani Durgavati Ji led the forces by herself and on every invasion, she defeated the Islamic forces.** These attacked continued for many years and every time the queen repulsed the Muslim warlord.\n\n# Faceoff against the Mughal forces\n\nIn the year 1562, the Mughal ruler Akbar vanquished the Malwa\'s warlord Baz Bahadur and conquered Malwa, making it a Mughal dominion. And the other neighbouring kingdom Rewa was conquered by the Akbar\'s general Khwaja Abdul Majid Asaf Khan, a man who vanquished Ramchandra, the ruler of Rewa. Now the kingdom of Gondwana was stuck between two kingdoms under the Mughal rule. The queen knew soon the Kingdom and the people of Gondwana will face another war.\n\nAnd as she had thought the prosperity of the kingdom drew the attention of the Jihadis. **In the year 1564 after taking permission from warlord Akbar, the general Khwaja Abdul Majid Asaf Khan attacked the kingdom. Although the forces of the queen included a respectable number of soldiers, 20,000 cavalry and 1,000 war elephants it was dwarfed by the Mughals who had control over many neighbouring kingdom\'s and their armies.** Queen prepared for the battle that was awaiting the Hindu Kingdom.\n\n# Battle at Narai Nala\n\nRani Durgavati Ji decided to defend her kingdom with all her might although her Diwan Beohar Adhar Simha pointed out the strength of Mughal forces. Rani maintained that it was better to die respectfully than to live a disgraceful life. T**o have the advantage and fight a conclusive battle the queen and her forces moved to the Narai Nala (now in Jabalpur), the Narai Nala was surrounded by a hilly range and two rivers Gaur and Narmada which made it the best location for a decisive battle.** As the enemy started to enter the are the queen and her forces started the attack. During the battle, the chief of the army was killed and now it was the brave queen leading the charge on the enemies. She chased the Islamic army out of the valley but she knew the Mughals would return after their humiliating loss and decided to go for offensive but the lieutenants did not agree with her. A mistake that came to haunt them as on next day the Mughal army returned.\n\nThe Mughal army returned with even bigger force and with more heavy artillery. Rani prepared for another battle. **Rani rode on her elephant Sarman and this time helped by her son Vir Narayan came for the battle**. Her son successfully forced the Mughal army to move back three times but he got wounded and had to be taken to a safe place.\n\nThe queen continued to fight the battle. During the battle, Rani Durgavati Ji was injured near her ear, and the other arrow stuck her neck and the queen lost her consciousness for a while. Upon regaining her consciousness the queen realized the loss was imminent. Rather than getting captured by the Mughal army or flee the battlefield like a coward, she decided to sacrifice her self. She decided to take her own life. ***Every year on 24th June 1564 her martyrdom day is commemorated as "Balidan Diwas***".\n\n# Aftermath\n\nAfter the death of the Rani Durgavati Ji her son continued to fight the war against the Islamic army. He defended the kingdom from the capital Chauragarh fort but he was also martyred. Thus, the kingdom of Garha-Mandla was annexed to the Mughal empire. After about 25 years, Chandra Shah, the younger son of Sangram Shah, claimed the throne of Garha-Mandla. The Mughal Emperor recognised him as ruler, in exchange for 10 districts, which remained with the Mughals. Finally, in 1698 the kingdom of Garha-Mandla was invaded and annexed by the Marathas. They continued to control the area until they were defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.\n\nRani Durgavati Ji was a symbol of property and vigilance in the face of oppression. She proved and taught how a kingdom should be run even when facing trying times of war. Even though the kingdom faced continuous invasions from many Islamic warlords, the kingdom\'s Trade and economy always prospered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the year 1983, the Government of Madhya Pradesh renamed the University of Jabalpur as Rani Durgavati Vishwavidyalaya in her memory. And since the year 1988, the Balidan Divas is commemorated in the memory of the Brave warrior queen. The train between Jabalpur Junction and Jammutawi is known as Durgavati Express, named after the queen.\n\n*P.S If any mistake is found in the article please feel free to correct in the comments below.

You can\'t hope to defeat something, that powerful with a seclusionist inward attitude or without making bridges between cultures. \n\nThe whole leftwing ecosystem, mainly comprised of media is very much international in nature and they pounce fast and highly coordinated on anything they see as a threat to their cultural and political dominance...amd we have already seen this. **The reason the international leftist alliance attacked NRC is based on their clear cut agenda to facilitate illegal immigration all over the world**(see Europe and USA, where they tried to burn down ICE immigration offices).\n\n**There has been significant amount of leftist propaganda in this subreddit with people claiming that there is no left wing/right wing dichotomy in India and that everyone is inherently leftist in India.**\n\nBecause Nehru and Indira had completely sold off all of India\'s government and media apparatus to the soviets and people were fed propaganda continuously through those machinery to believe that **capitalism was anti-poor** and thus got people dependent and addicted to welfare checks and subsidies to survive.\n\nSo the game is so rigged by the soviets in favour of socialism that if you need to win, you ought to pander with welfare checks and subsidies and hence, forever keep them poor(materially and mentally) so that they\'re forever swayed by welfare checks and subsidies.\n\nKeep in mind that the PVN/MMS lost subsequent election spectacularly even thought the economic liberalization of 1991 spearheaded the economy, significantly reduced unemployment and poverty and brought India out from the dark age of socialism.\n\n(See that the year coincides with fall of the Soviet Union) \n\nThe BJP and even the Congress of today to an extent is significantly right wing than you think, but they are fettered to socialism because of soviet propaganda through political and bureaucratic entryism aided by the Gandhis. \n\n\nThere was a post just yesterday on this sub, that claimed that American right wing and libertarianism was full of idiots and that we should never be allied with them. The poster claimed using clearly terrible points which I would try to debunk below. \n\n**"They deny climate change":**\n\nNo one denies that climate is not changing. They are skeptical of the collapse and doomsday predictions that climate scientists and hence the media had been scaremongering since the last 60 years. Each study claiming collapse and extinction in the next ten years. \n\nYou too would be skeptical about these \'predictions\' when you\'re in 2070 and the world still hadn\'t collapsed or got destroyed.\n\n**"That they are against abortion":**\n\nEven though I personally am pro abortion on a single libertarian ideal that you have every right to decide what happens in your body, I would concede that abortion is not a cut and dry topic. \n\nThe whole Rightwing argument is based on whether if you consider a foetus as a human individual with a right against getting killed. Especially since a foetus in the third trimester can potentially be separated and continue to live into adulthood. \n\n\n**"That they are anti vaxxers"**\n\nThe number of anti vaxxers are straight up insignificant in the west. It\'s just overblown by the media just like the media proclaim India to be rape capital of the world. \n\nBut, There can and should be legitimate criticism against unproven and unsatisfactorily tested vaccines like the HPV one lately in the UK. \n\n\n**"That they are Christian fundamentalists or racists"**\n\nThe racism that you see in most right wing racist in America is based on ignorance than malice, if we can become a powerful and a successfully rich country, this will change automatically. As long as we stay poor we\'ll be saddled with that image. Even the leftists who are "anti racist" has the same stereotypical image which they won\'t admit to having. So our only option is to destroy those stereotypes by becoming a prosperous country. \n\nDeng Xiaoping, China\'s Supreme leader who initiated economic liberalism, famously said this to the surprise of capitalist countries worldwide. But it\'s better not to let the communist find the truth about capitalism the hard way,... after all the harm had been done. \n\n***To Be Rich Is Glorious***'<br />Author: 'bernedindigo'  id: 'gpit01'<br />Score:26<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gpit01/international_rightwing_unity_is_important_to/</li>

I want to tell you all a pretty shocking event which happened over last night, and I want to raise awareness over it.\n\nMy mother's colleague's mother had been diagnosed with Covid-19 over the past night fortnight or so and was then duly admitted into an emergency ward in an hospital. Over the past few days, the conditions had been so squalid in the hospital that she had been shouting and pleading at the hospital staff to move her to someplace better, and just get her out of there, and in that trauma, she seems to have passed on.\n\nThis is not the worst part though. When shifting her body to the mortuary, the hospital staff seemed to have declared that she no longer has Covid, and that any of her relatives can visit her.\n\nNow, what is going on here? Well, none of us can really decipher. My father says that it is being done so to artificially reduce the death toll from Covid. I too do not know what is happening, but there is definitely something fishy here. The fishy and murky nature of the entire episode has had me much more concerned about my own relatives in India, like my grandmother who is also at a huge risk.\n\nGuys, please raise awareness about this issue and give your inputs as to what happened during the post mortem stage. This occurred in Chennai Purasalwalkam, KMC Hospital. This was a truly sad incident for my mom's colleague as he was the only son of the deceased, and now he cannot even conduct her last rites as he is stuck in a foreign nation.\n\nFinally, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take care of yourselves. As a developing nation, as much as we are slowly improving, our healthcare system is definitely below par. Please respect quarantine laws and mass report and shame foulplay like this.\n\nRegards"<br />Author: 'mexicomasala'  id: 'gph1pi'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gph1pi/state_of_covid_treatment_in_tn/</li>

Will HM take any responsibility if migrants end up causing a significant spike (to the tune of 100k) in cases in UP/Bihar/Jharkhand. \n4.

      <li>Title::: 'QA : Verse no. 2.65-66'<br />Body: '**Question 1 : What is the reason for the mind being always disturbed ? How it can be brought to a peaceful state ?**  \n**Answer 1 :** "Unless one is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.

Since childhood, I was taught that we respect cows because of the numerous benefits it served- from milk to farming to dung as fuel &amp; for cleaning mud floors to leather in death. As a reciprocity of all the gifts that particular element of nature provides to men.\n\nSimilarly, we worship Tulsi &amp; Peepal (Peepal from the times of Mohenjo Daro actually) because of the numerous medicinal properties. We worshiped the rivers Ganga &amp; at one time Saraswati for the clean water. Worshiped the sun in Makar Sankrat &amp; Chatt puja. Each aspect of nature which help us sustain gets a place of respect in the Hindu culture. \n\nPerhaps this basic philosophy of helping and respecting those who help you is also behind the culture which taught the children to respect their parents. But digressing here.\n\nIt is strange that a philosophy of thankfulness to nature is ridiculed by the left, which globally is all about environmentalism. Hindu respect of nature gets ridiculed as gangajal &amp; gaumutr, and the the taste of beef ends up preceding the environmental damages caused by large scale beef consumption. Sure Hindus have lost some way, and we would help respect Ganga way better by helping it keep clean rather than clogging it with puja samigri. But we are learning. At the base of it all, the basic philosophy of respect for the gifts to mankind by nature remains. And in ridiculing these aspects without seeing the philosophy behind it, these people actually come off as either malicious or really prone to following the herd syndrome (these are the kindest words I could find for them).'<br />Author: 'Jorg_RedAncrath'  id: 'gp0z58'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/gp0z58/respect_for_nature_hinduism_if_you_help_me_i_will/</li>

The invasions of foreign powers both Islamic and Christians do provide a significant reason for this, but some of the books which are associated with Hinduism also have rigid and sometimes questionable texts. The main culprit of this is the Manu Smriti, while not an original Hindu text it is by far the most associated when an attack on Hinduism needs backing.\n\nSo why do you think we are associated with conservative values, do you agree with them, if yes why and if no why and what will you think needs to be done to remove them?'<br />Author: 'Fluid-Lock'  id: 'goijjc'<br />Score:7<br />Permalink: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/goijjc/conservatism_in_hinduism_and_should_these/</li>
